Disclaimer: I do not own Twilight.This story has been haunting me for months and I'm glad to finally give it a life outside of my head.Reviews are love!PREFACE"I want to know why it hasn't worked yet!" the man in black screams to the elderly gypsy woman as she furiously consults the strangely shaped bones on her table, her frail hands hovering over them as she chants quietly, though the words are drowned out by his fury."I did everything you said, I have killed every last one of them yet their legacies evade me!" he hisses, the candle light flickering harshly over the deep scars on his face, remembrances from the battles he had endured taking out the Swan bloodline."I told you that you had to eliminate them all in order to absorb their legacies," the gypsy woman says, opening her eyes at the enraged man, her eyes pale with blindness but the man did not doubt for a second that she could still see him."Which I have done, Charlie Swan was the last of them, the final heir," he says, his pupils dilating into the long slits that betrayed his human form, impatience and anger radiating from every pour of his body as it shakes with anger."Charlie Swan was not the last of them. There is another."
