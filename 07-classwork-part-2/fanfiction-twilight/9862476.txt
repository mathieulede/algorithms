Seth woke up with his sheets all over the place, blanket in a crumpled heap on the floor, feeling a mixture of both excitement and despair; first day of school.Brilliant rays of sunshine fell easily through the window, right through the dream catcher suspended in front of the glass, painting intricate shadows on the walls. He had almost overslept. Seth untangled himself from the messy sheets, and jumped out of bed, nearly slipping and falling face-first onto the floor. "That was close." He said to himself.Seth found Jacob in the bathroom mid brushing his teeth, already dressed for school. "Good morning." He said, pecking him on the cheek. "Mornin'" Jacob mumbled back. "Why didn't you wake me up?" He asked. Jacob spat. "Well you looked so peaceful sleeping, I didn't want to bother you." Seth playfully punched his arm. "We have school today you dolt!" Jacob sighed. "Don't remind me... So, you excited to be going back?" Seth shrugged. "Kind of sort of... It feels weird though, you know? Just going back to school like nothing happened." Seth took a comb and parted his messy hair."Yep, but hopefully this will be a normal year."
