AN:If I ever had to film a short film of dark themes, this lines above would be narrated, the scenes and all which shall finally end in the shower where a thump is heard and a figure behind the shower curtain falls and the shower goes on and the camera will make its way slowly out of the shower room and the film ends. I'm posting this from my phone and it seems that the paragraphing doesn't work, sorry if it hinders your read.It hurts so good,it hurts so bad,I slammed the blade,and I'm on the ground to lay.The liquid that drips off,the silvery sheen on her body,The memories that we had,Are now another story.It hurts so good,It hurts so bad,The moans that leave her mouth,The passion that drives me.The gag that she has,The blind fold that she wears,I lick my lips with envy,For she makes me think of savory.It hurts so good,It hurts so bad,The innocence that she has,Makes me want to caress.The cry that comes off from her mouth,The pleas for release,They make me grow mad,For she is mine.It hurts so good,It hurts so bad,The end of a dream,In a shower full of steam.
