A/N: Hi and welcome to my new story. To begin with, this is a short prologue to get you interested and to inform you that chapter 1 will be posted on July 1st.******TBL******PrologueWhen I think back to that morning now, so many years later, I can still feel the fear and embarrassment I felt back then. If I'd known then about the consequences of one careless night, I'd have hidden in my bed in hopes of making it all go away.But I didn't know. And that's a good thing. Fate was actually on my side. Instead of pushing me into something I had to get through alone, it provided me with friends and a family who've been by my side ever since. And it brought me close to the man who turned out to be my destiny.Our beginning isn't a tale to tell at a casual get together, but it's our story and we're proud of it, because, if things hadn't happened like that, we wouldn't be where we are today.********TBL********A/N: Thanks to my betas EdwardsMate4ever and evelyn-shaye and to my pre-reader LaPumuckl who motivates me and pushes me in the right direction whenever I need it. I also want to thank Marie Carro for making the wonderful cover and banner for this story.I hope to see you all again in July.
