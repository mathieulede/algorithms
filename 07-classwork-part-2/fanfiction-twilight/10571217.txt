AN:Hello everyone. This story was posted a few years ago and then my life got in the way and I got major writers block and never finished it. I found my notebook unpacking and decided to take down the old story, make a few minor changes and repost it. I think I will post once a week. Maybe more if I am motivated. I hope you enjoy it. Don't forget to read and reviewPrologueDarling,Are you alright? You sound off.No resolutions. Well except maybeno bets or wagers this year. Theyalways seem to go horribly wrong. Weare in Massachusetts to attend Amherst.I can't say I am overly thrilled to startschool again. Cheer up darlin'.JI closed my laptop and headed to the throne room. I sighed as I took my seat."Yes?" he asked. "What do you have?""They are in Massachusetts to attend Amherst. They are starting this winter semester.""I want you to go there with Heidi.""Who do you want and when?""The mindreader and the fortuneteller. Take some time. I feel this will be a difficult task to accomplish""What about the empath?" I cringed as I asked, wishing I had kept my mouth shut."Hmmm. Yes, possibly him too. Now go pack"I bid my farewells and went to leave but was stopped before I closed the door."And my dear, did you take care of that other thing we discussed?""Yes I have." A smile ghosted my lips as I remember the fun I had."Good" he replied with a hint of a smile.
