I was excited, I finally get to see my older sister Bella! When she moved to Forks with our dad I wanted to go, but I was attending a boarding school at the time and had to stay and finish the year. Its finally over and I get to see Bella and Dad! My name is Rebecca Maria Swan by the way, nice to make your acquaintance. I'm 16 years old, two years younger than Bella. So here I am on a plane to Forks Washington and I couldn't be happier. I like to think of myself as a optimistic kind of person. You know the kind i'm talking about, the glass is always half full and there is a rainbow after every storm well that's me. I can't wait to see what surprises are in store for me in Forks.
