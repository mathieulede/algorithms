(I know emily's older but I wanted a age difference so emily looks at lottie like a little sister.)..I packed a bag and got in my car to drive to La might be a rescue mission or a I-can't-believe-you-didn't-call-me-because-of-a-guy-but-I-still-love-you-sis turn thing is I don't even know where to start looking so sadly I'm going to ask random strangers and that's creepy.Right I'm in La push and I just think I should go 's really beautiful here especially on the beach were I'm sat."Are you ok,"I look up to see a boy and I swear the world stopped.please review
