And, once they reach twenty years of age, both Mermen and Mermaids are semi-immortal until they reach one hundred and then ninety-five percent of their population dies. When a Merman and/or Mermaid finds, meets and touches his or her mate skin-on-skin, his or her tail take the color of his or her mate's eyes, his or her body take on his or her mate's most strongest bodily characteristics (if a Vampire is a Merman or Mermaid's mate, the first touch with his or her Mate initiates his or her transformation into a Vampire and the longer it takes for the two lovebirds to admit to their mate that they love each other, the longer the transformation into a Vampire takes (the longest it can take is five days if the two lovebirds don't admit they love each other before the change into Vampire takes hold of their body (don't worry people, Vampire-Mermen/Mermaids are very much in control of themselves around human), but if they admit that they love each other before the change into Vampire takes hold of their body the change into Vampire takes about three days). However, any offspring of a Merman/Mermaid-Vampire mating will be born a six-twelfth Merman/Mermaid and six-twelfth Vampire, and any grandchild(ren) of such a mating will be also a six-twelfth Merman(men)/Mermaid(s) and six-twelfth Vampire(s). When a Merman/Mermaid is born, his or her tail is apparent at birth. The Color of a Mermen' tail is always royal blue. The color of Mermaids' tail is always copper-brown. The pregnant Mermaid will, no matter what her situation, always give birth in the ocean or any other body of water.A Special Thanks to thunderful whose story Shields of Power inspired the plotline of this juicy mouthwatering story.Part One: the Mermaid and her VampirePrologueJessica's POVI have never given thought to death and destruction before, it was just a jobbut sacrificing myself in the place of someone I care about mainly both of my mistresses? It's something I'm not use to doing but I suppose I can do it, because of my training and being apart of the infamous Red Guard of the Volturi.I stare down the would-be assassin who has threatened both of my mistresses lives but only to lie about have them.As I said before, I would give my live for either or both of my mistresses. The would-be assassin laughs a harsh cold laugh as though he was amused by my intimidating position in the middle of the room. If only my Mistress Bella were here she could help me tear this criminal Vampire Coven of Nomads in no time at all.But of course that I think of it if only I'd kept to the plan outlined by Mistress Bella; I wouldn't be facing death right now.The would-be assassin smiled in very friendly way as he sauntered forth to kill me.
