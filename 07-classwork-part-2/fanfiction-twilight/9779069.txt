PrologueThe day that I was imprinted on . . .I should have know it was the beginning of the end for me.To give him my heart, my soul, my only hope.For a woman that can never truly be his.He was meant to protect me from danger, but he will always protect her from danger. He would never love me, like he loved her . . .In a enchanted glass casket at the bottom of the ocean, slowing drowning to death.I felt the burn of the water as it started to fill my lungs. I screamed and pounded against the glass wall.It didn't take long before the water filled up the casket, I continued my struggle as I pounded against the top of the casket. I felt myself losing hope of being saved.My eyes became heavy and closed, I felt all of my strength leave me and so was my will to fight.I felt myself automatically gasp for air.In the last few seconds of my life, I heard my mother say what she use to when I was little: With each day to whom I love may you know rest . . .
