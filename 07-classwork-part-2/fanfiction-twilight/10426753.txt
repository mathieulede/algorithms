We are moving back to Forks again, sometimes this life is tedious but it makes my Ali happy so I suffer in silence. I miss my brother and sister Peter and Char a lot but they have refused to speak to me since I choose to leave with Alice. The last thing Peter said to me was that I was making a mistake before walking away from me. But how could I be, Alice is my mate. As I'm sitting in our room lost in my thoughts Alice comes in "Jazzy what are you doing, we're leaving come on." I really cant stand being called Jazzy but Alice doesn't listen. "Ok Alice I'm ready let's go." I say. "I'm going with Carlisle and Esme, your riding with Edward and Rose and Emmett have already left." she says. "Ok" I say getting in the car with Edward we leave behind our home in Montana for our new home in Forks. "Why do you let her treat you like that?" Edward asks. "What do you mean?" I say. "She treats you like crap, like she doesn't care like your just someone she can boss around and not her mate." he says. "You don't know anything Edward," I snap "just leave it alone." I stare out the window and think about what he said. Why do I put up with it I wonder. Cause she's my mate, right?
