A/N: So this is my new story. I want to first say that I do not have a beta, so any errors are my own. Second, I do not own the Twilight characters, but I do enjoy playing with them. Third, don't flog me in your reviews. Lastly, this story is going to be rated MA because it will have adult situations, language, abuse, and eventual lemons. If you are not 18 or older, please do not read. Enjoy!PrefaceI never understood why a man would claim to love the woman that he could hurt physically and mentally without a care in the world. I often wondered why a woman that was being abused by the man she so desperately loved would blame herself for the abuse. I now know why a woman would feel like it was her fault because I have been blaming myself for two months now. Now, I ask myself what I did wrong or what I could do so he won't get so angry with me again.A/N: I do not condone abuse in any manner and I certainly do not believe it is the woman's fault. Please don't think that because that is simply not the case. Please bear with me on the progress on the story. I promise my characters will have their HEA.
