I do not own Twilight, all rights go to their owners, I own my own characters Emma Dwyer and Andrew Cullen.Emma Dwyer has always had a complicated life. She has always been second best to her older half-sister Bella and has never been wanted before. Her existence is based on a one-night stand between her mother and another man, which resulted in her birth and deterioration of her marriage. This furthermore caused a strained relationship with her mother and Charlie, who blame her for their relationship failure.However, Bella and Emma have always had a close relationship. They were in opposites in appearance and in personality. While Bella had brown wavy hair and deep, chocolate coloured eyes, Emma had fiery bright red hair and lime green eyes. They both had the similar porcelain skin, which further emphasised the colour of Emma's eyes. Bella was known as being the quiet half-sister, scared of her own shadow, while Emma was known as the younger, cocky sibling who was a trouble maker. But this was a facade. Deep down, Emma was an insecure young woman, fearing to love and abandonment. Her father left her after she was born and she never met him. This resulted in her fear of never being accepted; therefore she shut everyone out, never revealing her emotions towards anyone. They remained bottled up inside of her, waiting to explode.This attitude resulted in her lack of friendship and never being able to meet anyone, to love her for who she is insecurities and all. However, she moved to Forks Washington with her older half-sister to live with her father Charlie. She didn't want to remain with her mother anymore, who viewed her as her greatest shame. She would move to Forks and forget her previous life, starting anew.
