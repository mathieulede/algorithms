Hi everyone, my story can get a bit confusing at times so I just wanted to clarify a few things.1.) Collin and Brady (and that other dude?) stopped phasing for a bit to grow up to the human appearance of 16-year-old guys (Because phasing freezes their ages, if you didn't know that)2.) Yes Bella and Edward are married.3.) Renesme is about 5 years old so she looks about the age of a 15-16 year old girl. (They are just starting to see each other as more than close friend, just)4.) Charlie and Sue are married and are living happily together at his house (Leah got custody over her mother's house, she and Seth live there)5.) Yes, I might have mixed this story with a little bits and pieces of other stories. (But there not large enough that I feel the need to say this is a mixed story... and I kinda don't want to spoil the stories secrets)6.) yes, im going to be changing a few characters back stories around.7.) In my story I have a lot of music, because some characters like to sing *cough cough* because im to lazy and don't have the skill to actually come up with songs I'm taking them from other artists *cough cough pop stars cough cough* I'm pretending that they are my song but in no way, shape or form do I own any of them. They are for entertainment purposes only!Okay that's all, now I hopefully wont get sued! lolz jk. Lov'z ya!xoxoxoxoxoxoxo Enjoy.
