PART -1I, Bella, was moving to my dad, Charlay, to a place called Forks in Washington.My mom drived me to the air port. It was cold, weird and there was a ray of sunshine."Mom," I said. And opened my door."Daughtry," she said, finally slowing down before I fell out. I hadn't niticed the car was still moping.I sat on plane. It was cold, weird, and there was a ray of sunshine. The monsterious clouds swallowed it hole. I stared at the ceiling thinking of how life would be with only eight fingers. A child looked at me over his seat. I smiled. He puked. I didn't care.Bump, bump. Plaine crashed onto the ground! No, but I pritented it did. Guy next to me quirkcked an eye-brow when I hung onto my seat for dear life and paying to God. When we left the plain, he tried to steer away from me. Rude."Daddio." I sat into the old-fashioned truck. It was red. Or something."You."He looked at me with a smile. I smied back. He put on sum hillbilly music. "Welcome to Forks," he said.I stared straight ahead. Couldn't see shit, it was all foggy. I could see the outline of a wolf or something. I blinked. "It's butiful.""Yes, you, it is."This was going to be quite the adventure.
