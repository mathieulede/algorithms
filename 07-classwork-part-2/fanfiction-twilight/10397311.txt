Disclaimer: I do not own Twilight.INHALEPreface.I'm not sure I could ever go back to what my life was like before I met you, but, if I could choose between that and what I'm going through now - the after - I still wouldn't pick it. I would rather have the memories of our time together than the loneliness that made me up before you walked back into my life.They say that there's little to no hope of you coming back but I refuse to let go of mine. I'm writing our story down for you now, for when you do come back to me, so that you can see just how deeply and completely your love runs through me and will always run through me.Please come back.
