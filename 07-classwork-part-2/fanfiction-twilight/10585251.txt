On the weekends, it was nothing strange that Edward would leave his family's house to stay in his apartment in Seattle. Edward would go to university throughout the week but would be fed up with it quickly. The house he lived in, made up of three couples destined to be soul mates and him, did not help at all with his patience.Edward never got involved with anyone romantically - he was close to being in a relationship with Tanya but not because he wanted to. Tanya, who had grown tired of her failed relationships with human men, resorted to trying to seduce Edward. This was something strange to him because he always considered to Denali coven as family and no more. He admits to have lead her on for a while out of sexual frustration and pure idiocy.Other than that, no one else could comprehend how a handsome man like him wasn't in a relationship or with women often.But Edward had a secret who he'd never shared with anyone in the century he's lived - the women who satisfied him always got paid for doing so.
