Reuniting the Lovers:*I do not own Twilight, if I did I would be writing the actual books ;) Anyways enjoy. All rights go to Stephenie Meyer.BPOV (Preview of the first chapter)"What?! No. This isn't possible... is it?" I sat in my upstairs bathroom, with the one object that could change my whole future in my hands. I was shaking from shock. What scared me the most was the two pink lines. How could I be pregnant? I did it with edward once.. could vampires even create children? Well obviously they could.. or else.. this is a joke, but my symptoms gave me evidence that this was true. I had never been late a day in my life and I was late by a whole week.Edward had left.. he claimed he did so I could have a normal life.. and it hurt to think of him. I was still in love with him, but was he still in love with me? How can I handle this on my own? Charlie won't be happy, Renee won't be happy. They are just going to think I am just like every other girl at school, stupid and naive for having sex in high school in the first place. And I wasn't even halfway into the semester... how was this going to work?Through all of my questions.. one thing stood out. I couldn't give up this baby. It was a part of me, and... part of a man I love with all my heart. I heard Charlie's police cruiser pull onto our cobblestone driveway and I knew I had to tell him about this. He was going to figure it out sooner or later. Either from taking me to doctor because he'll mistake it as me being sick or when my stomach grows.So, now I knew what I had to do and I was heading downstairs to face my new destiny.Please Review :D
