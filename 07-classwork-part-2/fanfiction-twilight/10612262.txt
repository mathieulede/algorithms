New story. Have questions, let me know.Continue or let it die? Drop me a line./\/\/My name is Bella Swan, a 22-year-old recent college graduate.And all I wanted was to be normal.When I was 15, my mom and her new husband took me to Hawaii for fun in the sun and the beach. What started out as surf lessons had ended in disaster.Family fun turned into a disaster when I was attacked by a shark. Disaster turned into devastation when the doctor had to amputate my left arm above the elbow.At 15, I turned into a freak.And at 22, the freak show isn't becoming any easier. Even with a prosthetic arm, full range of motion was impossible. My status as an amputee was not well advertised. I hid my left arm well, and limited the movement of it.I couldn't really swim, and I refused to set foot into the ocean. And yet, here I am, moving to an ocean front town. The same ocean front town that home to Jasper Whitlock, two time Olympian, and twelve time gold medalist. Swimmers swarmed here to prepare for Olympic trials, and the town had more pools than roadways.Ocean Front, California was getting a new librarian.It's time to expand my horizons.
