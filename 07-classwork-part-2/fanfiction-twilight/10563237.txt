Twilight fanfiction.Chapter 1: Volturi: Bella's POV:I saw Edward at the clock tower, sparkling. ''NO!'' I screamed. Before I got to him, the volturi took him away. I ran to the throne room. I opened the doors and saw Alice. She said ''tell Jasper I love him. Give him this. There is one letter for each of you. tell Jazz,that i'm am so sorry this had to happen. Then Alice was in ashes. 'I'm so sorry, Jasper.' I thought. I ran out of there. I went back to the airport and when home. Edward was already in the car. My phone rang. ''Hello? I can't talk now. I'm on my way to your house. '' I hung up. I went to their house and saw them on the porch. I saw Jasper there with them. I hugged him. Surprisingly he hugged back. Edward growled.''What happened?'' Jasper asked. ''I tried. I did the best I could. I'm sorry guys. Alice is...gone." Jasper ran up to his study. Everyone looked at me. ''I got it.'' I went up to his study. I opened the door. Jasper was sitting like I was when Edward left me. '' I went up to him and hugged him from behind. ''Jasper I am so sorry. I did the best I could.There was no way I could have fought them by myself. I couldn't do anything to save them. Alice has something for all of us. Alice wanted me to tell you that she loves you. Do you want to come back downstairs?'' I looked at him. ''No.'' Jasper whispered. I stood in front of him and looked in his eyes. ''For me?Please? I know that you aren't happy, but none of us are. Please come downstairs.'' I offered my hand. he looked at me. He took it. ''Hey. i forgot something. She told me to give you these. they are from her. one for each.'' Everyone looked at my hand intertwined with Jasper's. Carlisle and Esme looked like they could cry. Emmett and Rosalie raised an eyebrow in question. I gave them each of their letters. i opened it and it read:Dear Bella: take care of Jasper for me. I know that you guys will get along. I've seen you two being together. He is your mate. Even though I love him. You are the only one he will listen to right now. He needs you. You need him. I knew that you two are meant to be together when I had a vision of him hugging you and never wanting to let you go. Every time you aren't near him he feels like he has to be around you. He loves you. Let Peter and Charlotte explain. But don't tell Jasper until he heals. Be there for him. Secrets will be revealed. You and Jasper are mates. That's why you were hurting so bad when we all left. You needed him to be near you because he felt the pull towards you. For you it's sparks. for Jasper it's pain when he's not near you.
