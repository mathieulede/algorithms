In this story imprinting is imperfect(ya know, like life), people fight and make mistakes, and just because someone is your 'soul mate' doesn't mean that everything is all rainbows and butterflies. HEA as always, but it's not all going to be smooth sailing getting there, and just because our main pairing gets an HEA doesn't mean everyone else does. Cullen's exist, but they don't interact with humans in this story, so they don't go to school, Bella has never met them. Jake and Bella aren't close friends in this story, he's her father's best friends' son, that's it, they barely know each other. Sam and Emily are 21 in this story, Jared and Paul are 20, and Bella is just a couple months away from 20.**Bella POV 9:15 pm**Pulling my car into the lot, I find a spot and sigh as I pull into it. Putting the car in park, I grab the duffle bag on the seat next to me, and get out of the car. Going around to the side entrance, I hit the doorbell, and a couple of minutes later Dami, our head of security, buzzes the door so I can open it and go in.Black Dog Bar is a strip joint, I could be polite and call it a gentleman's club, but let's just call a spade a spade here. I work in a strip joint, not even a strip club. It's run down, and seedy and half the time they don't check the ID's good at the door. Usually half the audience ends up being underage college frat boys who come more for the two dollar beers than the titties. Though what they end up saving in beer cost inevitable goes down onto the stage or gets tucked into the G-strings of us girls.Yes as clich as it is, my name is Bella Swan, I'm almost twenty, I'm a single mother to a beautiful 20 month old baby girl, and I'm a stripper, please don't call me an exotic dancer. I had gotten this job on my nineteenth birthday. My father, Charlie, had died in a robbery gone wrong a few days after my seventeenth birthday, my mother, and her second husband had died in a plane crash along with his entire minor league ball team two years before that, and so I've been on my own since losing Charlie.The insurance was helpful, I used it to cover the mortgage and bills while I finished up my last year of high school. I had my dad's pension and benefits too, the pension was enough to keep me fed, his health benefits were good too so I was okay during my pregnancy.Looking back I guess it's not surprising that I ended up in the predicament that I did. My dad was the only family I'd had left, and I hadn't been real interested in making friends when I first moved in with him after my mother died, so the result of that was that I didn't have any. I had acquaintances, and that was all.So after Charlie died I guess I went a little crazy. I drank a lot, smoked a lot of weed, and just all around partied, seventeen was considered an adult in the eyes of the law here so I didn't have any adult supervision and word got around that I was crazy, and had a house all to myself. There were a lot of parties, a lot of nights I ended up in my bed with someone who was just one step removed from being a stranger.Tyler Crowley changed all that, well not so much him as the fact that he thought he could pull out in time, and was wrong. I found out I was pregnant in February, just 4 months before graduation. When I told Tyler about the pregnancy he told me to send him a picture after it was born and that if it was black he'd think about believing me that it was his.My daughter was born in November, just two months after I turned eighteen. I named her Jasmine, Jasmine Olivia Swan, because it's beautiful, and exotic, just like my baby. She truly took the best of both of us, both our races and ourselves. Mocha skin, big brown eyes(my eyes), and a full head of smooth jet black hair. Tyler's mother, Latisha, raves on and on about her hair.Latisha loves Jas, she may hate my guts, but she loves her grandbaby, just dotes on her. Truthfully she only hates me because I make her hate Tyler, and what mother can truly hate her own child? Tyler got a football scholarship to college, he left without even a goodbye to his mom, and he refuses to take any responsibility for Jas. He's never even held her. He told me that even though she clearly isn't white, he doesn't believe that he's the only black guy I was banging. When I told him he was the only black guy I even knew he just was like, 'yeah, so you say.'.It doesn't matter though, Latisha believed me, and she's been a really big help. She always watches Jasmine while I work. I ended up at Black Dog Bar because the insurance money ran out, and I had to make more than the eight bucks an hour I was making working at the Newton's store to support me and Jas.Jasmine was just a little under a year old when I started working at the bar, now she's just about four months shy of two. It's not a bad gig really, I work 6 hour shifts, and make in one night what it would have taken me three grueling eight hour shifts to earn at Newton'sI set my duffle bag down at an empty station, opening it and kicking off my purple converse sneakers. My friend and sort of boss, Tammy, comes up beside me, saying, "Hey there Bell, decent crowd out there tonight, I think we pulled some business convention guys. Middle aged guys who are tipping great, bring your A-game girl and you could have a week making night."I nod, and she walks over to talk to one of the newer girls. Tammy is basically head stripper, she shows the new girls the ropes, helps us learn what is and is not appropriate, what we can let a guy get away with, and what we should be screaming for security for. She's like an older sister, and we deal with her before we deal with management about anything.I shimmy out of my jeans, fold them up and put them in my bag. I grab the black vinyl G-string and pull it up over my hips, adjusting it into place. I hadn't experienced too many body changes from the pregnancy, my doctor said it was because I was so young. Really the only things affected had been my boobs and my hips, and in the end both of them were affected in good ways.I finish doing up my boots and step into the tiny pleated hot pink and black micro mini, pulling it up I settle it into place, and go back into my bag to grab the hot pink vinyl demi bra. I put it on, settle my girls into place and do up the front closure.I pull on the artfully shredded Rob Zombie tee and step back to take a look at myself. I look like the slut at the bar at the metal show, tiny skirt, barely there top, and thigh high 5 inch platform lace up boots. Yeah, those business guys won't know what hit them.The final touch is the black wig. It's a good one, styled into two high pigtails with hot pink streaks worked throughout. The black against my pale skin makes me look even paler, and with it my stage name, Raven, makes more sense. I catch Tammy's eye in the mirror, as I bunch my hair up on top of my head, and put on the cap to hold my hair down. She winks at me, as I start pinning and spirit gumming the wig in place, and tells me, "20 minutes till you're on Raven."**Paul POV earlier in the evening**My best friend Jared Tompkins comes through the door of my house and flops down on the couch, saying, "Dude you bout ready to go?"Sam's bachelor party joy ah well, any excuse for strippers... even if that excuse is the death of your best friend's sex life. Actually his sex life's been largely dead for a long time. Imprinting, what a joke, sure him and Em are relatively happy together, but what the hell is the point of having a soul mate if you're not getting laid on the regular? I mean shit, I get more pussy than him.I shrug, "Yeah, I mean tits so that's fine. Any idea what club we're going to?"He nods, "There's a strip joint on the edge of Port Ang, it's real popular with the college kids, has a rep for being friendly to the underaged. Plus the name of it is Black Dog Bar, so how perfect is that for Sam?"Yeah, I guess I forgot to mention that one small detail. My friends and I, we're werewolves. I know I know, Paul, you're crazy, but I'm not. Sam was the first to phase, that's what we call it when we go from one form to the other. We were sort of prepared, the tribal legends tell us that in times of great danger to the tribe certain members will phase become one with their spirit warriors and take on the wolf.So the Cullen coven moved back to our area, and now me, and 3 of my friends are big hairy beasts at least some of the time. The Cullen's are vampires, you heard me right, vampires. They feed on animal blood and stay to themselves for the most part so our great grandfathers made a treaty with them.Anyway Sam when he's phased is pitch black, that's why Jared said the name of the bar is perfect for Sam. I laugh sharply, "That's awesome! So uh, how's Kim?"He shrugs, "I dunno. You know Kim, she's here, she gets her fix, and then she leaves again."He and Kim have a weird thing; she's his imprint, which technically means that she and J are soul mates. Imprinting is the wolf basically choosing what he sees as his perfect mate. The first time we look her in the eye post phase, that's it. Life as you know it? Over.So yeah J and Kim; she's his imprint, but she also has a boyfriend who lives with her in Seattle. Part of the Imprint is that the wolf will be whatever the girl needs, friend, lover, or in Kim's case apparently a part time fuck buddy. So she lives with her boyfriend in Seattle, and when she comes home for holidays and vacations she has J to keep her occupied.Jared pulls a bowl out of his pocket, and offers it to me, asking "Smoke?"Shrugging, I reply, "Yeah, sure. Why not?"I take the bowl, grab a lighter off the table, and take a hit. Letting go of the carb, I inhale the sweet thick smoke, and hold my breath while I count to ten. Exhaling a white column of smoke, I hand it back to J, and say, "I'm good, lets get this show on the road."We leave my house, I lock up behind us, and we get into J's truck. Sam is gonna ride down with his younger half brother, Embry Call, the other member of our pack.**About a half hour later still PPOV**Jared pulls into the lot of the bar, and we find a spot, and park. The signs are cheesy neons with the name on it, the whole place is kind of a dump, but there's a big crowd at the door.Sam and Embry are coming towards us, I catch Sam in a light headlock, "Sammy! Your last night as a free man! How you feelin bro?"He shoves me off him good naturedly, and laughs, "I guess I'm as good as I can be. Emily is staying the night at Sue and Harry's."Jared busts out with exactly what I'm thinking, "Wait, wait, wait! Are you telling me that your fianc is spending her last night of freedom with your EX girlfriend?"Sam shrugs, "What? They are cousins man and Leah's going to be her Maid of Honor tomorrow. It makes sense"Jared shrugs again, "I guess"We make our way to the door, and Sam greets a guy he used to go to school with, "Dami! How's it going man?"The bouncer greets Sam enthusiastically, "Sammy Uley! My man! How's it goin buddy? Been a while!"Sam grins as he answers, "I'm good man, I'm good, me and the boys here decided to come down and see the girls, my last night as a free man and all."The guy looks floored, "Dude seriously?"Sam nods, "Yup. Heart attack serious."Dami opens the door and steps aside, "Dudeget on in there man, get crazy. We got some fine ass girls on tonight. I think there's one table left by the stage, go snag it before Raven goes on, you don't wanna miss that chick man. I'll get you and one of your boys a private dance after her stage show. On the house man."They shake hands, and Sam says, "Thanks man, I really appreciate that."We make our way in towards the bar, and a waitress wearing a skin tight mini skirt, platform heels, and what appears to be nothing else comes up to greet us, "Welcome to Black Dog Bar, guys. My name is Sunshine! Dami told me to take care of you guys special. Now, who's the guest of honor?"Her firm titties are the same golden tan color as the rest of her, obviously from a tanning bed rather than the sun since this is Washington, but damn is she fine with her ass length blonde hair flowing around her. Sam sheepishly raises his hand, and she grabs his hand, and pulls him along after her, "Okay then, right this way, Boys."Her ass sways seductively as she brings us over to the table. She pulls a chair out a little, and sets it up where she wants it, and basically settles Sam into it, as she yells out, "I'VE GOT A BACHELOR PARTY!"The music changes, and all eyes are on our table along with a spotlight as Sunshine works her body to the music, her tits dangerously close to Sam's face. Her hands are on his shoulders, and she works them down his arms, grabbing his hands and placing them on her hips. He runs his hands over her abdomen and she takes them and puts them back down as she moves back and turns to face away from him. Her hips are swaying, and she straddles his lap and proceeds to grind on him.Embry just stares, Jared shakes his head, whispering to me, "Damn man, it might actually be worth getting married, look at that girl!"The music stops, the spotlight fades back onto the stage, and Sunshine jumps lightly off her perch on Sam's lap. Sam reaches into his pocket, and she takes his hand gently, smiling as she says, "Don't worry about it, Big Guy. It was my pleasure! I don't always get to rub up on guys who are so handsome. Or so polite, you didn't even get overly happy to see me."Sam laughs, blushing, I mean seriously, the guy is blushing as he says, "Well you know. Getting married tomorrow"Sunshine laughs, "You're really sweet. Your fianc is lucky."She walks away, swaying her ass to the beat of the music.The lights start to change, going dark and sinister, and the emcee says in his best horror movie narrator voice, "Gentlemen, gentlemen! Our next girl to grace the main stage is our Mistress of the Dark, our own gothic beauty, the sinister, the sexy, RAVEN!"The lights go down, there's a short crackle of static, the spotlights hit the stage, the girl with her hands on the pole is gorgeous, her platform boots make her about 5'9, her body is bangin, round firm ass peeking out from the micro mini skirt, tiny little waist, and nice big tits.Jared elbows me, "Sheesh, no wonder that Dami guy acted like he was doin Sam a big favor getting him a private dance with her!"The opening note hits, and as a woman's voice intones, "Use my body to keep you alive", the stripper throws her head back, staring straight out, looking straight into my eyes.I feel like I've been punched in the gut as she grips the pole, gyrates her hips, sways her ass in the air. She slides her hands up and down the pole as she drops down and undulates her hips towards it. I can't look away, but then she starts to work her way down the stage, going to one of the poles on the side, and dropping down on her knees to crawl seductively towards the middle aged man with a fifty dollar bill in his hand.Jared is looking at me funny, I start to moan, and shake, "oh no.no no no no no.. This can't be fucking happening!"I have to stop her! I can't stand here and let her do this in front of the whole pack, not her. Not my fucking Imprint The wolf is close to the surface as the businessman and his buddies tuck bill after bill in the side of the scrap of fabric she's calling panties. He snarls in my head, I know I must be making some level of noise, but I can't help it, all I want to do is kill the motherfucker who trails his bill up the side of her boot, and tucks it into the top.Sam clues in, as I start to push back from the table and turn towards the stage with a growl. He winces, and the Alpha is clear in his voice as he says, "Paul STOP! SHUT YOUR MOUTH, AND GO OUTSIDE!"His order keeps me quiet, but that's all it does. The one thing the Alpha can't interfere in is what's between a wolf and his Imprint. Lucky me, my imprint is a fucking stripper! She probably prefers the term exotic dancer though. Fucking shit! The music hits the first chorus, and Raven spins dramatically, pulling open her little half shirt and throwing it onto the stage by her feet as she sinks down to that same group of old fucks and starts shoving her bra clad boobs in one guys face.I start to move but before I even get 4 steps, all three of my friends grab me, and manage to drag me out the door.The cool summer's night breeze hits my face and I keep struggling until Sam hits me, screaming, "STOP!"This time the wolf complies. Sam breathes a sigh of relief, as the three of them drag me into an alleyway away from prying eyes and passersby. He tells the other guys not to let go of me, and then intones in his Alpha timbre, "RELAX. Try to relax, Paul."He is looking at me strangely, and all I can do is sneer back at him. Finally Jared says, "Sam you Alpha ordered him to shut up. He can't talk."Sam curses, "Oh for fuck's sake! Talk, Paul!"All at once the lock is open, and I ramble, "Oh fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck! Shit Sam you have to go in there and stop her! Actually no, don't go in there, God we have to get out of here! We have to go! If we don't get the fuck out of here I'm not going to be able to stop myself from hunting those business guys down. I swear Sam, I'll kill them for what they were doing! You guys have to promise me that you won't come back here to see her show!"Sam and Jared are dying by this point, they are actively laughing at my fucked up situation and I'm about to lose it Embry must sense it, because he speaks up, "Dudes, come on, I think he's really serious. We should get him back to La Push"The three of them muscle me to Sam's truck and throw me into the passenger seat. Sam barks at me, "Fucking behave yourself, Paul!"He comes around and gets in the driver's seat as Jared climbs in the back. Sam asks him, "What about your truck?"He shrugs, "I gave the kid my keys, he'll get it home."Sam nods, and pulls out of the parking lot. I feel sick to my stomach. I mean of course I knew imprinting was fucked up, but this was beyond I mean yeah Sam imprinted on his then fiance's cousin, and that was a fucking mess, but at least Emily doesn't take her clothes off for money! And yeah I mean Jared imprinted on a girl with a boyfriend who refused to give either of them up, but again, at least she doesn't let middle-aged fucking businessmen put bills down her panties!Jared squeezes my shoulders from the back seat, a brotherly gesture that only sort of makes me feel a little bit calmer. Then he says the absolute worst thing he could say, "Fuck man, at least she's fucking hot!"Snarling, I start to go for him, Sam swerves as he screams at me, "PAUL MAN ENOUGH! STOP THIS BULLSHIT RIGHT FUCKING NOW! So help me, Paul, if you don't knock it the fuck off I'm turning around and going back in that club and I'm going to take a private dance with her. I'm not fucking kidding you!"I feel a little more in control, but still, I ramble, "Fuck you Sam! How would you feel in this fucking situation?"He sighs, "Dude truthfully, I'd feel just like you."I snort, "How do you know how I feel? My Imprint, my supposed soul mate, TAKES HER FUCKING CLOTHES OFF FOR MONEY! I mean what the actual fuck! Yeah your imprint is a bitch who even though you would've been anything she chose she wanted you to cheat on her cousin with her and for you to leave Leah to be with her, and yeah Kim is a sex fiend who likes to have her cake and eat it too but neither of them take their clothes off for FUCKING MONEY!"Heaving a sigh, I start to settle down because I know I have no choice. Sam looks only mildly sympathetic, as he says, "ya know Paul. I could just let you stew. I mean you don't even know that girls real name. I'll bet you 100 bucks that her name ain't Raven. You could have lost her for good because you don't even know where she's from! However I'm a good guy. I'm a reasonable man. And for those reasons, I'll call Dami for you tomorrow and see if he can give us some info on the very beautiful Miss Raven"**Back in the club, BPOV**My music cuts, the lights go low, I gather up my discarded clothes and the bills that are on the stage, and head back towards the locker room. Vanessa, aka Sunshine, stops me, "Don't forget you have a private show for that bachelor party in one of the VIP rooms, B."I nod, "I won't forget, V. You did the initial lapdance, what's the report?"She smiles dreamily, "He's amazing, B. I mean he might just restore my faith in men!"At that moment, Dami comes up to us, "Don't speak too soon V. Uley and his boys just peaced out. Thanks anyway B."Smiling at him, I reply, "No problem, Dami. Anything for a friend of yours."He blushes, "Thanks B. I appreciate that."Heading back into the changing room, I pluck the miscellaneous bills from where they were tucked, and then sort through the bills from the stage. Tami was right, those nerdy business guys sure did tip good! I arrange the money and count through it, I whistle lowly. Shit. I made a mint! 400 dollars! Oh fuck that's amazing. And the nights only half over. Generally I consider myself lucky when I make 200 a night, and in a couple of hours I just made what some people make in a week or more!Folding the money I put it down deep in my boot, no way I'm leaving a wad like this hanging out in the change room. I don't really want to have to beat a bitch for stealing my money. I pull on my outfit, and go back out into the club.Walking carefully in the heels I approach the businessmen who made the beginning of my night so lucrative. They applaud as I sit down at their table, "Hey guys, I just want to thank you guys for coming out to see me, and being so generous! Can I interest any of you in some one on one time with me in our VIP room?"This was hard for me at first, schmoozing one on however many with the horny guys who come to the club. This was where the money is though, I mean yeah some nights you can get a cluster that'll pay the majority of your rent on the stage, but the majority of the time, that kind of money is waiting for the one on one show.Dami waits on the edge of the group, waiting to see who takes me up on my offer. The businessmen nudge each other, laughing and joking. Finally they push a young guy into the middle. He must be an intern, because he blushes very, very, easily. His face is nearly crimson as I go over to him. Wrapping my arms around his head, I bring it down just above my chest so he gets a nice eyeful of the goods, as I say, "Come on with me, Honey. I won't bite, not unless you want me to."The kid laughs, and we make our way back into the VIP area, with Dami following. Dami explains the situation, "Alright my man you get a half hour for a minimum 300 dollars. That fee is only payable via major credit card. Some of that fee goes to the illustrious Miss Raven here, the other half gets you a very nice bottle of champagne. Rules in here go as follows, you do NOT touch the girl, you get me buddy? She's gonna touch you some, she may rub her pretty titties all up in your face, she may grind all up on your funzone. You lose control and put your hands on her, and I'll be forced to throw you out. On your face. Do NOT touch the girl! Are we clear? You can, however, pour your champagne on those beautiful big titties of hers. Just don't forget, no touching, no kissing, no contact other than her having contact with you, none the other way around. Am I clear?"Mr. Innocent again laughs nervously, and agrees, "Yes sir, we're crystal."Dami laughs, "Alright then."He pushes the intercom and Cinnamon, one of the bartenders whose real name is Jenna, brings back the bottle, and takes his credit card. She'll charge him for the champagne, and my half will go into a payout account that I'll have to cash out at the end of the night. Whatever else he tips me in here is just icing on the cake.My music starts and I start swaying in front of him, putting my hands on the sides of the chair back and settling on his lap thrusting my hips against him while taking my shirt off. This time I have no bra on underneath though, and my tits spill out into his face.Almost immediately I feel the bulge in his pocket rubbing against me. Dramatically, I rise spinning away from him, bending over so he can see my ass, working my way back until I can undulate my ass over his lap sitting back down and feeling his erection poke at me through his pants as I reach back, grabbing the seat, and arching my back. I feel his hands moving, the papery feel of the bill being dragged lightly down my abdomen, the subtle stretch of the vinyl away from my skin as he tucks the bill into the waistband of my exposed thong.I arch my back again, this time bringing myself up to standing again, moving my hips in a pendulum motion as I thumb the button on the wrap around skirt, and time it's removal with turn. As I come back down facing him this time, letting my tits just graze his face as I move sensuously to the music.He reaches for the champagne bottle, and spills a small stream over my breast. The cold liquid puckers my nipple into a stiff bubblegum pink peak. I let out a staged moan, and he does the same to my other breast. I keep moving as the champagne runs down my breasts, over my stomach, and down to my pussy.I get up and bend over, putting my ass practically in his face as I reach back, grab the waistband of the g-string, and pull it teasingly down and back up between my ass cheeks again. I'm about to do it again, when I feel his hands on my hips.I scream, "DAMI, HANDS!"The lights come on, and Dami pulls me out of the guys drunken grasp, yelling, "WHAT THE FUCK DID I TELL YOU, BOY!"He grabs the shaking kid by his shirt collar, hauls him up, and yells in his face, "Give the girl more money you rude fuckin prick! Don't you ever come in here and think you're gonna put hands on one of my girls!"The guy by now is practically blubbering while he grabs his wallet, digs out a bunch more bills, and thrusts them at me, "I'm sorry! I couldn't stop myself, I'm so sorry!"I take the bills, but Dami has him half out the door before I can think of a response. Looking at the bills I find that they're assorted higher bills. Three twenty dollar bills, a fifty, and a one hundred dollar bill. 210 dollars I bring the money out of where he'd been tipping me and add it up, these ones are assorted small bills, five singles, two fives, and a ten. I take the hundred, and when Dami comes back in the room I hold it out to him, "Here, thank you, Dami."He smiles as I pull on a short black satin robe, and says, "Don't sweat it baby girl. Why don't you go get yourself cleaned up, your next time up on stage is a little less then an hour away. Put that money away sweetie, I know Miss Jasmine's birthday is coming up soon. I'm sure you could use the extra."I nod, "Thank you, Dami."He play punches my jaw, "no sweat, Kid."**Time skip, still BPOV**Four am finally rolls around, and I go back to the changing area. My feet hurt, I'm dead tired, and all I want to do is get back to my baby girl. I had made a fucking killing tonight. Tami hadn't been kidding about the business guys making my week. Hell they had almost made mine, and many of the other girls' months!I reach into my boot, and pull out the wad that I'd been cultivating all night, and add the cash outs from my VIP room visits into it. I count through it quickly, and my breath catches as I shove the wad down into the pocket of my duffel bag. A thousand dollars, a mother fucking GRAND! Oh shit! My heart leaps as I almost jump for joy.This is the first time I've ever made this much in one night, three VIP room visits at a hundred bucks a pop had helped a lot, but still, I mean damn.I'm barely standing under my own power in the boots now, and I use the zipper on the side to get them off as quick as possible. My aching feet hit the cold tile floor of the changing area, and I sigh a little in relief.Stripping down I put my street clothes back on, zipper my duffle, and say to the room at large, "Alright bitches, Raven is leaving the building! See ya when I see ya!"Tammy waves as I go out the door, winking at me as she says, "What'd I tell you about those business guys huh B?"I nod, "Ugh, you were so right! Those guys practically made my month!"Dami waits on the other side of the door, it's protocol that only one girl leaves at a time, and that Dami or one of the other bouncers walks us to our cars. He wraps one arm around my shoulders, "So Bella, you have a good night?"I grin at him, "I had a great night. Thank you for dealing with that guy, though you probably didn't have to scare the poor guy half to death!"Dami is like a big brother to all the girls who work in the club, especially the one's with kids. He makes sure that we never have to go home to our kids scared or messed up in any way. He has 4 sisters, and was raised by a single mother. He dates Jenna, the two of them have been together for a couple of years and she says that he is the sweetest man she's ever known.We get to my car, and he gives me a hug, "Alright B, I'll see you tomorrow. Get home safe."I get in my car and start the twenty-minute drive back home.Pulling into Latisha's driveway, I leave the car running, shutting the door quietly behind me as I go up to the front door.I knock lightly, and Latisha opens the door in her bathrobe, "Bella."Stepping inside, I say, "Hey Latisha. How was she?"She shrugs, "Fine as always. Bella, I know you don't want to hear it again, but I really think it'd be better for her to just stay here, especially on Friday and Saturday when you work both days. So she doesn't have to go back and forth, and she doesn't have to be disturbed in the middle of the night."I hold up a hand to her, "Just stop Latisha. Jasmine is my daughter. I appreciate everything you do for me, and for her. I know you don't have to. Tyler's name isn't on her birth certificate, so really you're under no obligation to help me, I just want you to know how thankful I am to you."The unspoken part of this conversation is the fact that since Tyler refuses to acknowledge his daughter I am free, at any time, to tell Latisha to fuck off. She has no claim on Jasmine, she'd have to take me to court to get a dna test to even prove she was Jasmine's grandmother, and then she'd have to take me to court for custody.Sure she could win, I'm a nineteen-year-old stripper, I know the odds. However, I also own my own home, my own car, and I take care of my daughter on my own. I had stopped smoking weed the day I found out I was pregnant with Jasmine so she'd really have no leg to stand on, and she knows it.Latisha sighs, and steps aside, "You know where she is. You're going to have to arrange for someone to watch her tonight though. I have a date."I nod, "That's fine, I had a really good night, I'll just take tonight off. Black Dog Bar will just have to do without Raven on the main stage on a Saturday night. They'll call Leah probably."Leah Clearwater fills in at the club sometimes, she's from La Push, and is a total hottie. She goes by Isis Rose on the stage, and Frank, the owner, was mighty pissed when she went down to picking and choosing the few night she was willing to work.She had started stripping as a way to build her self-esteem after a pretty bad breakup; apparently her asshole fianc had taken up with her cousin. He just dumped her and then he got engaged to the cousin!Leah tries real hard to make sure no one from La Push knows about the shifts she does at the bar. She says her parents are both well respected in their tribe and she doesn't want to embarrass them. The only person from La Push who does know is Dami, and she knows she can trust him to keep his mouth shut.Heading up the stairs, I turn and go into the room where Jasmine sleeps at Latisha's place. Jasmine's face is serene, peaceful, and angelic in sleep, her lips are slightly parted, sweet little cherub's lips. I brush my thumb over her chubby little cheeks, and carefully pick her up.She wakes slightly, enough to whimper, "Momma."Burying her face in my neck she falls back to sleep as I carry her downstairs. Latisha waits by the door, and as I pass her to leave the house, I say, "Thank you. I'll see you on Wednesday."I'm off on Sundays and Mondays, the two days the bar is closed, and since I'm taking today, Saturday, off, I essentially have a 3 day weekend, which is a rarity for me. Opening the back door of the car I settle Jasmine into her car seat, and strap her in.She starts to snuffle, and I stroke her face gently, "Hush baby, it's okay, go back to sleep. We'll be home soon."The baby quiets, and I shut the door gently, and get into the driver's seat and head home. The grey pre-dawn light filters down through the trees, I love being outside this early in the morning, the majority of the town sleeps, and life is peaceful and good.
