Its one that was impsired by a couple of other stories I recently read. I hope you enjoy it. And if you loved my other stories, please keep me on alert to see when they are back up.As always, I don't own Twilight nor any of the characters. If I did, I wouldn't be in the rubbish job I am right now :(Enjoy!ChangesPrologueWe were best friends. Our lives were spent together. Every day - in school, outside school. Week days, weekends. Mornings, afternoons, nights. We were the six best friends. No one and nothing ever came between us. Nothing.So where did she go?She just dissapeared.Bella...Where did you go?Author's notes...Yep, its very short. But this is the taster. And a test to see if its worth keep going.
