Hi,I just need help to find this story I once read, then I'll take this post down.I think in the story Bella is a massage therapist, and Edward is a famous music composer for movies. He comes to Bella to have massages and Bella falls in love with him. I belive Edward's composer name is Tony.When he realises that Bella fell in love with him, he leaves her but they meet again in Italy on the set of a movie if I am not mistaken.Can you please give me the title for this story, I have been looking for this since quite a long time but no luck in finding it.Thanks.
