A/N: Here is my new offering, this will be more difficult to post than the last, I posted chapters quickly for 'Hades' Flower' this one will not be as fast.I have more freedom with this one it is not as complete as the last this one it is more experimental.It is a Bellice story thru and thru, but it has a past experiences with a human Esme, and Rosalie/Emmett vampire dalliances with an angel, who is not so angelic. The Rosalie/Emmett interactions are not in anyway described just talked about so don't worry if that is not your cup of tea, and there is no lemon regarding Esme whatsoever.***Please I beg of you if you are offended by any characterization of religion that deviates from your strong beliefs, I am on my knees DO NOT READ, I do not mean to cause any offense whatsoever, I respect everyone beliefs religious ones as well as non-religious. What I have written in no way reflect my own spiritual beliefs***Jeez that was one hell of an author's note sorry about that, on with the story.In the hierarchy of angels there are the Powers warrior angels created to be completely loyal to God, all except one. Bellice don't like do not read. OCCDisclaimer:I do not own Twilight, proof of that is that Alice and Bella were not mates in the books or movies, unfortunate, but true.01. PrologueThis was something she always enjoyed, stealing away in the night from the castle, sneaking away alone for a hunt. Not necessarily alone mind you, but with her trusty stallion Necromancer, a big strong steed a warhorse, black as a winter night, more ferocious than a mother bear protecting her cubs.It had been successful, the hunt, three rabbits gutted and skinned plenty for the cooking pot that bubbled as she stirred.She heard Necromancer neigh ready to be unbridled, to roam to hunt. He, like she was aware they were being watched, both knew by whom."Easy boy, I know he is there" he bobbed his head and snorted, asking for permission to get the hell out of there "he is not that bad is he?" Necromancer snorted once again.She finished with his bindings, removed his bit and bridle, she rubbed his nose, granting him permission to do his bidding.She settled herself in front of the fire, in front of her now, ready to eat, rabbit stew. She grabbed her ladle and scooped the stew into her bowl. After taking the first delicious bite she leaned back against the boulder behind her and let out a sigh to release the tension; it was time to talk to the 'person' that had been lurking in the shadows "you can come out now".He made himself visible as he walked towards her, the fire light illuminated his face "I have been waiting for the beast to leave" he spoke as he sat across from her. They both heard the horse neigh in the distance."Necromancer is no beast at all" she slurped a bit of stew as she spoke "a beautiful stallion, a gift from Lucifer himself".She chuckled at the look he gave her "it bothers you so much, Gabriel, does it?" she took another bite of stew in her mouth "that they vie for my attention, for me to serve either of them" she pointed her spoon at him "your god" then into the distance "and his".Gabrielle looked out to where she pointed "Azriel you may join us" Gabriel let out a heavy sigh he did not want to deal with him too; it was just not his day.Azriel approached the two, he had been watching, waiting. It was always interesting when her dealt with her he found her endearing in many ways, Gabriel, not so much.There were none like her, they were other Powers, but she was different, given the power that Lucifer had craved the one given to man, free will. "It is good to see you" he sat across from her next to a miffed Gabriel.She finished her stew and wiped the dribble off of her chin with the back of her hand "as always it is a pleasure to see you Azriel" she put her empty bowl down and stretched out in a relaxed position "so what brings you both here?""We have come with a request" Gabriel was the first to speak."Both of you?" She found it perplexing that both Lucifer and God sent them both to find her. It was always one or the other, this would be interesting."I am afraid so" Gabriel hung his head dismayed "as you are well aware; no one is permitted to interfere with matters regarding man but you"As Gabriel spoke Azriel was giving lustful glances at the stew bubbling in the pot. How he wished he could dip a spoon in it and gobble it all up, unfortunately angels no matter what kind, dark or light were not given such pleasure."Yes of that I am aware" she gave Azriel a look, it always made her chuckled at the way he drooled when near food, or beautiful women "that, however, does not answer my question" she spoke after she looked back at Gabriel."There has been a plague that has run rampart through the Holy Church" Gabriel spoke forcefully wishing it was he, the warrior Archangel was permitted do the deed himself, but alas there were laws not ones that were meant to be broken "we request that you deal with the problem"."Why does Lucifer care what threatens the church?" She directed the question at Azriel, who jumped slightly; he had been so enthralled with the smells and sight of the stew that he had not listened up to that point."This plague is not of a demonic variety" if it had been a demonic insurrection then he would have been commanded by Lucifer to deal with the issue "it is more of a human problem"."And as for recompense, what say you Gabriel?" Dealing with humans was not necessarily her cup of tea, too weak and frail. Gabriel mumbled a response "I did not hear you Gabriel"Gabriel sighed once again "a kingdom".She laughed at how disgusted he looked "I do not require an kingdom, I have many" Azriel quietly listened he had an ace up his sleeve but he would hold out, he liked watching Gabrielle flounder "Lucifer has provided me with plenty"."You do not understand" Gabriel itched to be the one to be send in to accomplish what God required, to him she should be jumping at the opportunity to serve. He never understood why she was created, why she was allowed to do as she pleased, and not serve the All Mighty dutifully, as it was decreed all Powers would."No Gabriel you do not understand" she pointed behind her "look up there what do you see?"Gabrielle looked to where she pointed "a castle"."Yes Gabriel a castle, and I have many" she leaned forward resting her elbows on her knees "roaming through its halls there are bare chested and bare assed fillies, ripe to be consumed by me" Gabrielle was at his breaking point "there are also strong strapping stallions with tail feathers protruding from from their backside, dusting my lacquered table tops" she leaned back against the boulder behind her "do you think I am referring to horses Gabrielle?" Azriel snickered, Gabrielle shook his head, he did not want to speak else he would explode.She stood and called for Necromancer with a whistle "have you seen my helm or my Claymore, Gabrielle?" Gabrielle gave her a mumbled yes "and my armor, have you seen that?" he nodded "they are magnificent don't you think?"He had to agree, he had seen her in her armor before it was a sight to behold.The armor was as black as pitch, but shone bright, angelic markings where etched upon it in gold, mirroring the almost invisible tattoos on her body and face.Her helm was of Corinthian design, with a majestic shiny black plume running down its center.Her Claymore was also black same as her helm and armor it had gold markings, but when in battle the gold would turn to hellfire and flowed like ragging river through it.Necromancer appeared out of the woods "and then there is Necromancer" he neighed "my most treasured gift" she placed the saddle on his back and meticulously fastened the straps."We have already offered you a gift" Gabriel panicked when he saw her climb atop her horse."Azriel tell him how many gifts has your master given me?" She grabbed Necromancer's reigns ready to depart, she had no intention of engaging with humans."Too many to count" Azriel answered grinning wider than he had when the conversation started, he could see fumes shooting out of Gabriel's ears."And of those many gifts how many favors have I granted him?" she patted Necromancer's mane, she noticed he had been glaring at Gabriel as if he was rabbit stew, she needed him calm, the last time Gabriel was near him he bit a chunk out of his ass."One or two" Gabriel looked between the two he did not understand how it was possible that she was given so much and done so little.She leaned back and settled herself comfortably on the saddle "so you see Gabriel, I get to choose" she took the reins and began to turn Necromancer make her leave."You haven't heard everything yet" Azriel spoke ready to say his peace."I was wondering when you would get to the good part Azriel" he had been entirely too quiet, other than answering questions he had been mum."I was so amused by him here" he pointed with his thumb at Gabriel "that I forgot to mention that you will be able to participate in your favorite hobbies".She turned her horse back around "what hobbies?" Gabriel did not like what he was hearing."Killing and fucking" Azriel answered the question with a smile."Ahh the glory of killing and fucking" she sighed contentedly "keep talking"."The plague that sullies God's house are vampires" Azriel was giddy it was always a grand spectacle to watch when she was doing both of those things."See Gabriel that is what you should have led with" now she was interested."You will do this task because you get to kill and fu-ffu""Gabriel" she sighed in mock admonishment "you may not have a dick" she looked at him enjoying the sight of all the hues and colors the skin on his face were turning into "but you can use your tongue to say the word as well as to do the deed".Azriel lost all his decorum, he burst out laughing; he knew that wherever his Master as well as God where they were laughing together, he was not the only one that was entertained by her.This act had been going on for millennia, both God and Lucifer competing amicably against each other neither would interfere with man, but would have a Power, who would work as an intermediary, only if she was persuaded, and Azriel was a master of persuasion."You know 'He' knows" she smirked at an annoyed Gabriel."Of course he knows God knows all" he looked in her eyes trying to decipher where her statement was leading, he was nervous."But your thoughts, your lustful sinful thoughts, you do know he is aware of those" she loved flustering Gabriel; she liked him she just wished he would loosen up."I am an Archangel, I do not have sinful or lustful thoughts" Gabriel crossed his arms and lifted his chin proudly."Gabriel even I know that when I am fucking you watch" he blinked furiously, he did not want to go there "that when I pleasure my fillies with my tongue you whimper with need and hunger" he began to shake with rage "when I spank my stallions on their muscular asses and they cry out in ecstasy" she knew he was at his wits end "your phantom cock aches to be stroked" Azriel tried as hard as he could not to laugh, no one was better than her at breaking Gabriel down "which would you rather be Gabriel my filly or my""Enough!" They both laughed at Gabriel, he could never take the teasing."Careful, careful Gabriel you know they are watching" she left him alone, she indeed knew he had enough, she didn't want him to get into any trouble she just wanted him relax and to not be so uptight, to be more like Azriel "so what exactly do you need me to do, and tell me more about this kingdom".Lucifer slapped his hand on his knee and laughed uproariously. He noticed God sitting next to him in front of the big screen "Come now Lord Father, why the long face?"God sighed "I worry about her" he stroked his beard as he spoke "sometimes I wonder if we did the right thing by giving her free will".Lucifer sighed as well, he was fond of her too "she is but an instrument Father" he leaned back "but you are right I worry about her too".God looked at him not believing what he was hearing "you worry about her?""She saved us you know?" he stood and walked over looking at the screen in front of him "you disposed of you vengeful wrath and gave it to her" he lowered his head "and I am able to live vicariously through her" he turned to face him "to know what it would have been like to have the gift that you bestowed upon man"."And now you see why I never gave it to you" they watched as she spoke to Gabriel and Azriel "all that power" he sat back in his chair "and all she craves is killing"."And don't forget the fucking Father" Lucifer sat down next to him once again he smiled when he saw the smirk on God's face.The fight was all but lost he swung his sword decapitating what, he as a man of the cloth, believed was a demon charging towards him.Of the others only he remained to defend the abbey filled with old men, children and women. Most of those who had fought alongside of him had died instantly, a few lay on the ground writhing in pain.He had been praying for salvation, as he was sure those that remained in the abbey were. His prayers were not answered, and he wondered why he had wasted his time, why did he become a priest?Another 'demon' charge towards him with his blood red eyes and snarling teeth viscous liquid dripping from its fangs.He decided that his final prayer was to ask for God to allow him to die instantly and not be one of the ones who still screamed in agony.He fell to the ground as the 'demon' neared, descended upon him and bit him in the neck. He shivered as he felt the blood leave his body. Then calm came upon him, he knew his end was near.Suddenly he felt the 'demon' torn away from him he desperately tried to open his eyes to see where it had gone. After struggling for a moment he was able to see, barely. In a haze he could see his salvation. A celestial being, something his faith had told him was real, he was never quite sure. All of his life saw death and destruction all his life he never believed they would be real "an angel".The angel picked the 'demon' straight into the air and buried its flaming red sword, into the demon's back, its final anguished screams filled his ears.The 'demon' exploded into cloud of embers that floated in the breeze they disbursed violently as his savior's wings sprung open.The angel walked closer to him, he tried to focus, to see everything, but the burning pain he felt overtook him. He shut his eyes tightly.He felt a cooling touch on his chest that spread though his body then everything turned into darkness.He smelled it, the scent of apples 'does heaven smell like apples?'He heard crunch "no" the answer came from somewhere close to him, next to him.He slowly opened his eyes and turned his head slightly towards the direction of the 'no'."Careful now father you have been through a lot" another crunch on the apple.He struggled to sit up, without assistance, since none was offered. The woman who sat next to him eating an apple sat casually in her chair, her feet crossed atop a stool with not a care in the world.He looked over to her wondering who she was something about her seemed familiar but it didn't register. She was dressed in an undignified way, more like a man would. Not a common man, mind you, but a man.She wore britches and a button up shirt all black along with an also black long overcoat. Tied neatly around her neck also black was an ascot, the only thing not black in color was a broach pinned to it, a ruby crafted most likely by a master craftsman in the shaped of a swan."Are you going to stare?" she spoke once she swallowed "or ask questions?""Have we met before?" He almost slapped himself, it was difficult to speak and there were more monumental questions he could have asked."In the field of battle" the woman never looked at him she studied the apple intently, singularly focused on it "I love apples"."I ordered all the women to retreat into the abbey" finally regaining his voice he spoke sternly to her, chastising her.She looked away from her apple instantly she did not care for his tone "I do not take orders Father" he shrunk at the glare she gave him "and if I were not there you and everyone else would be dead" she returned to her apple eating.He knew now who this 'person' was "you are the angel" in the field of battle she wore and helm that covered most of the face, only part of her chin and mouth were exposed along with her eyes, the eyes were distinctive. They were like a doe's eyes, but had a glimmer in them, they possessed fierceness and veracity.She finished the apple core and all "yes" she reached and grabbed another from a bowl next to her filled with them.He finally looked around and noticed he was in an unfamiliar place "where am I?""You are in one of my castles" another crunch and more chewing."Angels do not live in castles" he did not understand what this woman was he wondered if he was being deceived "or eat".The woman chuckled "I am no ordinary angel, Father".He felt a soreness on his chest and winced he looked down to find a marking in the middle of it. He touched it noticing that is was just like the pin on the woman who still ate her apples "what have you done?""I have marked you" she stood "I have given you my name" walked away "now put a shirt on, we do not want to impune the purity of the others.He quickly grabbed a fresh clean shirt that was lying on a table next to him, put it on and followed behind her. He almost tripped on himself as he walked down the corridors; he gawked at the refined artwork the masonry fine silks and carpets."You have questions, you may ask them as we take a stroll" the woman walked like a queen, striding purposefully."Where are the others?" He felt badly that should have been the first question he asked."I have situated the villagers around the castle, they are safe and protected" he wondered about the others that fought alongside him "Some of your fellow priests are recovering" she descended the grand staircase the doors opened "most were too far gone"."The demons?" he felt like an idiot, his questions where not complete enough, something about how the woman walked made him believe that their time was short."Not demons Father vampires" as they walked he admired the beautifully manicured lawns. The same children that were once locked in the abbey played in the courtyard."Vampires are not demons?" he asked"Vampires are human Father" he was perplexed "infected humans, but human none the less" they approached the stables "faster and deadlier" she smiled at what was to come, as soon as she got out of there "they possess a lot more stamina".He wondered how they would be able to survive these 'humans' "What are we to do?" he sighed.As soon as they entered the stables she grabbed her saddle and placed it on Necromancer's back "I have given you gifts, abilities" she fastened the buckles and straps as she spoke "this castle, for you to tend to, a safe haven for those in need".She grabbed Necromancer's reins and walked him outside of the stable "we have minimal training; we are not capable to fight them"."Do you know what I am Father?" she spoke to him once he settled herself on the saddle."You are an angel" he didn't know what else the woman could be."Do you know of our hierarchy?" the Father nodded, of course he knew "I am Isabella Cygnus, a Power, an Authority"."A Power" he whispered, things began to register "warrior angels, keepers of history and bearers of conscience""Not my department Father" she clarified, he was not listening."Also they oversee the distribution of power among mankind" he continued to speak, out loud in a whisper, in reverence, he could not believe what was happening."I think you finally getting the picture Father, anything else you need to know?" She noticed from the corner of her eye that her lead vampire was approaching."Isabella, we are ready to go" she spoke in a soft melodious tone "the 'captives' have been secured. There was a purr when the vampire said the word 'captive' almost like the vampire took pleasure in saying the word."Ahh, yes Siobhan, I will meet you beyond the gates in a moment" Siobhan gave priest a seductive smile and blurred away."Isn't that a vampire?" He was barely able to speak when the vampire was near she looked at him as if it wanted to eat him."Yes Father, isn't she lovely" her eyes drifted away from where she had been looking, he could not see what she could, a total of twelve new vamps waited for her patiently, one short of her lucky number, but twelve would do."Were you not supposed to vanquish them?" He was not happy, not happy at all."I was given an assignment to give you the ability to rid your holy church of the vampire plague by God" the thought warmed him that his Holy Father would hear his prayers as well as answer them "and Lucifer" his face fell.She turned Necromancer toward the gate."Wait" she slumped, she was ready to get out of there, she had lots of fucking to do, and lots of beautiful vampires to do so with "what of the vampires that are leaving with you?""To the victors go the spoils Father Carlo" she didn't hesitate and sprinted out the castle gates.Lucifer laughed like a hyena, doubled over with tears in his eyes, God was not happy "don't be so upset Father; you got exactly what you wanted Isabella delivered".He slapped his forehead "this is not how I wanted this to go" he grumbled "I wanted her to lead them, not to give them so much freedom"."You wanted her to do the deed and fall in line Father that is never going to happen" Lucifer knew God better than 'anyone' he expected too much. He desired to have Isabella be his sword and have her tend to his flock, his children, the way God did before he withdrew from mankind after the flood, something he still regrets, to watch his children suffer."You have a nice little human army to rid you of the cockroaches in your kitchen" he explained to God how good things had worked out "Isabella gets her kingdom" he sat next to God "she got to kill" they both turned to the screen when they heard screaming in coming from it "and she is fucking" another scream of ecstasy "I get to be entertained" he looked on at the activities "see Father everybody is happy".A/N: I hope at least one of you enjoyed reading the prologue. I should be posting every other day this time around. I am trying very hard to work on the structure of this story, it is difficult, my mastery of the English language is woeful at best. I want to make reading my story an enjoyable experience and not tedious and difficult, wish me luck.Until next time.
