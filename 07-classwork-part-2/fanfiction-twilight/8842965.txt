New Story!EmxBYes, supernatural elements (it's me, duh!) but no vampsLet me know if this is a no or a go!/\/\/\/Can I just say that I hate the rain?Let me rephrase that.Fuck you rain, and the horse you came in on. These are brand new shoes, and while I normally don't give a shit about fashion and all that nonsense, these are brand new ballet flats. Not sturdy boots, or tennis shoes, but flimsy ass, blister giving, open to the element, shoes. Why am I in these impractical shoes you might ask? What the fuck am I talking about you might ask?Oh.That's a legitimate question.Let me start over.My name is Bella Swan. I am 25 years old, and I graduated from the University of Washington with my bachelors in business, and now own a dog grooming company in Seattle. The company is called Swan Song, in partly honor of my dad, who bought the building for me before he passed away from cancer. Oh irony. Sweet, sweet irony.So, I'm a short, sassy, take no mother fucking shit from no one gal. Wearing stupid, stupid shoes. Even though today is my day to walk to dogs.Why?To impress a guy.Of course it is to impress a guy.So, here's lil' old me, drenching wet, in soggy shoes, with newly acquired blisters.All because of Emmett McCarty.But that's the middle of the story.Let me start at the beginning.But before I do all I can say is Emmett you better fucking appreciate these shoes
