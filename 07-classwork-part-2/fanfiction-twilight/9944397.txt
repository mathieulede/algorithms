1. Prologue(BPOV)I'm frightened.Every night I'm scared.The reasons change if I'm honest. Whether it is fear of my father, or the students at school or even me, it doesn't make a difference.It is still fear and I'm still afraid.There is a part of me that hopes things can still be okay. There is a part of me that knows one day, things will be okay.Will that 'one day' become tomorrow?Probably not.I'll just have to wait and see.Like I've been doing since the 11th of September 2001.
