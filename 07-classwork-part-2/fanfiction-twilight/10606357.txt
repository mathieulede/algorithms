*Taylor's POV*My name is Taylor, Taylor Jean Almos. So I guess I better give you my background story, my parents and my brother and sister died when I was 12. My sister was 13 and my brother was 9. So I have been living with my aunt and uncle in Idaho for four years. But they recently informed me that they are having a baby and they are moving away so they don't want me to come with them. So they said since I am 16 that I can't live by myself yet and they are sending me to live with my cousin Sam and his fianc Emily. I have never even met them so I'm not sure if this is a good idea. But so on with the story, the story I call my life"Taylor do you have your clothes packed?" My aunt asked coming into my room."Yes I do I'm ready to go" I said. They are taking me to the airport and they are planning on never seeing me again. How thoughtful right? As if my whole family dyeing wasn't enough pain for one lifetime. So I loaded my suitcases into the car and they drove me to the airport. They helped me make sure I was getting on the right plane and drop my bags off. When it was time for me to board it looked as if they were about to cry."Taylor I know you think we don't want you anymore but that's not the case its' just you need to explore more things and get to know more people and actually make friends since the incident." My aunt told me. I couldn't help but roll my eyes I mean this whole situation was bull."We really do love you Taylor." My uncle added. I just couldn't believe this they are ditching me and they still expect me to love them. I mean I do love them they took me in when nobody else would and they homeschooled me when I couldn't handle it but now it's like they are throwing me away like old bread."Yah whatever I hope it hits you what you've done someday I said turning around and going through the gate to board the plane. I heard my aunt yelling my name but I really just didn't care. I boared the plane and waited for it to take off
