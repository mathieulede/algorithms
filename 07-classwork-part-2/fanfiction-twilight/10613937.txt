Chapter 1: Bella's POV:I was at the Cullen's house. I've been looking at the window for hours. I can't believe it. I've been keeping secrets from all of the Cullen's. They were my family, my life now. I bit my lip nervously, a bad habit I had learned from a friend. Someone knocked on the door. My heart skidded. ''Bella? It's Edward.'' I didn't acknowledge him. ''Can I come in?'' I didn't say anything. He came in. ''Bella? Are you alright?'' I nodded. ''She's lying.'' Jasper told him. I turned and looked at Jasper. I turned back to the window, so that Jasper and Edward couldn't see me blushing. Ah, another flaw. I was up there for another few hours. I left a note for Jasper and the rest of the family.I can't tell Edward. I couldn't bear it. I drove off, went to my house, packed and left before any of them could stop me. I really hoped Alice didn't already have a vision of this. It would foil my plans.I can't hurt Edward or the rest of them. Especially Jasper. What would he do if he finds out that he and Alice aren't mates? What if he finds out that Jasper and I are? What if Jasper will hate me when I tell him? I can't let them know. I wrote a note to Charlie as well. I don't know how to tell them. I knocked on Angela's door. ''Angela, I need advice. I've been keeping a secret from the Cullen's.'' I told her. ''I don't know what to do. Help me.'' I sighed. I told her my story, careful not to tell her anything from the vampire world. ''I think you should talk to them. Jasper will understand. So will Edward.'' I sighed. ''Alice knows when I decide something, just by looking at my expressions.'' More like her visions, I thought. ''Edward will be furious. He will never forgive me.'' I sighed. ''Bella. Tell them. If you don't the will be suspicious.'' I looked at her. ''They already are. If Edward finds out I might have to leave town.'' I told her.Alice's POV;I was walking down the stairs when I had a vision:''I can't tell him. But I can't help it. If he finds out, I might have to leave Forks, for good.'' Bella said.I gasp. ''Alice what did you see?'' Jasper asked me. Everyone was in the room, now. ''Bella saying, 'I can't tell him. But I can't help it. If he finds out, I might have to leave Forks, for good.' Edward didn't look happy. ''What does she mean by that?'' I looked at Jasper. ''I don't know what she meant.'' I told them. I had another vision:''Bye, dad. I'm leaving Forks for awhile. You don't have to worry about me. I have made my decision. I can't hurt him. I can't. I can't dump my problems on him, hurt him, and maybe the rest of his family to. I don't know if I will come back. But for now, i'm not. I'll be ok. I promise.'' Bella said, hoping her dad knew she was serious and stubborn when she arose to a decision.''She's leaving Forks. She doesn't want to, but she is. She doesn't know if she's coming back. But for now, she's not.''''Why? She hasn't kept anything from us. She hasn't kept anything from Edward at all. Why now?'' Emmett asked.''You don't think that she's cheating on Edward, do you?'' Esme looked at Jasper. ''JASPER! Bella would never do that to Edward. She must have a good reason to leave.'' Esme said. I doubt it. What if her leaving has something to do with her birthday party? ''Sorry.'' Jasper went upstairs.Jasper's POV:I went upstairs and knocked on the door Bella was in. ''Bella? Are you in here?'' I opened the door. She's not. I picked up a note on the bed. ''Guys. meeting NOW.'' I yelled. I ran downstairs. ''Jasper? What's wrong?'' Carlisle asked. ''She's gone. Bella is gone.'' I opened the note. I read it out loud. ''Dear Jasper and family. I'm sorry. I had to leave Forks behind. Jasper, I want you to know. I don't blame you for what happened at my birthday party. I never did. You guys leaving hurt me. Especially you Jasper. But I understood. I guess. Jazz, Don't blame yourself. I know the real truth of what happened at my party. I will tell you when I get back. Bye. '' I concluded.I felt as though someone took my wretched unbeating heart and danced on it. I needed to find Bella.Fast.
