Chapter 1"Hurry up Mason or we're going to be late for school!" My big sister Isla shouts.Isla is my older sister; she's fifteen years old, which is a year older than me.I am not able to walk because I have diabetic foot ulcers, so my wheelchair is my mode of transportation.My mom is standing at the door waiting with a smile on her face.Her name is Millie and my dad is Seth Clearwater and they have been married for 17 years."Have a good day sweetie, I love you!"I pull myself up in the truck beside Isla who's setting in the middle seat and dad throws my wheelchair in the back.The hallways at school are pretty hard to maneuver through because of the crowd that forms before classes start, but people usually move out of the way giving me a look that shows pity.I don't want people to feel sorry for me; I just want to be a normal kid like everyone else."Hey Clearwater, where you going?"Great! Craig and his goons have spotted me.I just try to pay them no attention and make my way to my first class."Don't roll away from me while I'm talking to you!"Suddenly my wheelchair screeches to a halt and I see Craig behind me holding the handles."Hey Charles, how fast you think I can make him move today?" Craig asks with a menacing smile.Suddenly I'm flying down the hallway and smash into the trash can which catapults garbage all over me."Hey it's my turn now! I bet I can make him go even faster." Charles sickly smirks."Leave him alone!" Isla screams as she is grabbed by Craig's other four friends.Charles laughs psychotically as he gives me a huge push sending me into a locker causing me to flip."Hey jerk why don't you come do that to us." Says my friends coming to my aid.One is named Jack and he is the son of Jared and Kim.He's very tall and is starting to develop some major muscle.The other is Henry, which is the son of Paul and Rachel.He is also very muscular and tall.All of the girls have been all over them ever since they came back from summer break with their devilish good looks and new muscle mass.The other is Leo and he is the son of Embry and Jenna.He's two years younger and very skinny and not all that tall either.We all are typical Quielute tribe boys with dark hair and russet skin.Suddenly there is an outbreak of pushing and shoving but it ends with Craig and his goons running off saying they don't want to get in trouble.I don't much blame them for running.Not many dare to rival against the size of Jack and Henry, Leo and I are sort of just tag alongs."Thank you once again for the help guys, I wish I could take them." I say as Jack helps me back in my chair."That's what best friends are for" Says Leo.Craig sets behind me in my class.His whispers are unavoidable as he continues his rumors about my dad being on steroids and now he's supplying them to Jack and Henry."It's too bad steroids can't make you walk again Clearwater.""You better be glad I can't walk, if I could and you tried one of your stunts, you're mom would be paying medical bills.""Ooooh, that's big talk from someone who is three feet tall."Mom picked me up from school."Where have dad and Isla got off to?"Your dad is still at work and Isla went to the mall with some friends.Even after all of these years I am still unsure of what my dad's occupation is.His hours always vary and he really doesn't talk about it, even when I ask him he dances his way around the question.It's rumored that him and mom are "Protectors of the tribe" whatever that means.I do see them with some other members of the tribe on occasion and they have secret meetings that I am not allowed to go to, but I guess they just talk about legends that I'm not old enough to hear.My dad says that one day it will all make sense to me, whatever that means.As I was going to get my toothbrush before bed I noticed mom and dad's door was cracked.I was tempted to listen in just in case they told some of these "secret" legends, but I decided against it.Suddenly I heard my name and my attention was drawn to their conversation."Isla could phase anytime soon, she'll be 16 in a few months it's a good possibility but I just don't know about Mason, it's too hard to tell so much is unknown.""Maybe he will still phase, he's still young. I just don't know we've never had someone with a disability"Suddenly they stop talking as if interrupted, I wonder if they heard me.My dad's words kept echoing in my head.What did he mean by phasing?Plenty of people have had disabilities, why would he say no one?Why is Isla going to phase soon?Is she going to go through a teenage phase or what?I don't know what any of this means.I'll just have to be patient until Isla goes through her phase, whatever it is.Since apparently I may not ever go through mine, which makes no sense because I will turn 16 one day as well.All this confusion is making my head hurt, which means tomorrow is going to be a long day.I just hope I can get some answers soon.A/N: Please review and let me know what you think of this I would greatly appreciate it. I didn't really know how to start this but I have some great ideas for it. You don't have to read my story "Breaking Imprint" to know what's going on in this one but it'll definitely give you some background to this story. Hope you like it!
