Hope you enjoy.Prologue*Flashback*''Bella I will try to keep in touch with you, I can't promise you anything but I will never forget you. I love you Isabella, you'll always be my princess.'' Carlisle said.''I love you too, dad. I will try to visit you as much as I can and if I see anything that might hurt you or your loved ones I will be there to help you out.'' I told my father.*End of flashback*That was the last time I saw him.My name is Isabella Cullen and I'm a 109 year old vampire, I have more power that any other vampire. They all fear me, all the girls want my beauty and all the boys want me. I was turned into a vampire at the age of 17 in 1905 and shortly after my transformation I joined the Volturi, I was given the title of princess due to all my powers. One month later I found my biological father, Carlisle, who is also a vampire. He taught me to hunt animals instead of humans and we agreed to keep in touch. Time passed by and I decided to leave the Volturi and to go explore the world.Today I had a vision of myself going to a small town in Washington called Forks.Well, I guess I have to pack. I thought.Sorry if this is short. Review please and tell me what you think!
