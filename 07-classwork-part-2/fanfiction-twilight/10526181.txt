A/N I don't own anything or anyone besides Paul and djChapter 1Leah sat in her office at home on the couch with a glass of whiskey in her hand staring out the window lost in thought, she always got like this around this time of year every year for a full week she would get away from everyone just to find some place quite to think. You see Leah's mother birthday is in to two day the same mother she hasn't spoken to in 7 years and my how things changed in those 7 years that she hadn't talked to her mother, don't get her wrong it's not that she didn't want to talk to her mother and brother in those 7 years it that after she left home 8 years ago, she would call to let her know that she was OK and that she was fine but someone wouldalways be there demanding answers.Demanding to know where she was and that she has to come home when they where the reason she left in the first place, she just got tired of everyone making her out to be a bitch, like she was always in the wrong she got tired of be treated like shit, of always being the target.If you guys didn't know Leah is a shape shifter she shifter into a wolf and she not the only one, a few people from Leah's tribe are shape shifters like her but she is the only girl and because of this she was tormented, bullied and pushed aside and it got even worse because of Sam and Emily those are the people she will never forgive, she hates them with every fiber of her being see Sam was Leah fianc and Emily was her cousin, Sam was the first one to turn in a wolf he went missing for week and came back acting like nothing happen. Leah would ask what happen and why he was acting different be he would always give her some lame excuse and tell her not toworry about it, then a few week later when her cousin Emily came to visit she notice him acting weird again being distant barely spending timewith her, then one day on her way home from work she walked in onthem having sex in her bed where she sleeps, where she's suppose to have sex with her fianc not her cousin so naturally she got pissed and wouldn't talk to them she didn't need and explanation because she saw with her own eyes.The sad part about it was that her parents where happy for them her father going as far as to have a Bon fire for them, her Brother was the only one on her side even her mother was happy about it. From that point she avoid everyone but her brother only going home after everyone was a sleep and leaving before they woke, until one night her father had a party and the whole pack and council was at her house so naturally she walked in the house an didn't bother to look at anyone and went straight to her room. Only yet again walking into her bedroom was a bad idea because the second she open her door she froze, there on her bed again was Sam and Emily making out Emily with her shirt off straddling Sam and she lost it yelling,screaming throwing thing at them and that got everyone attention they came running to see what was going on only to find Emily trying to put her shirt on and Sam trying to calm Leah down, but it didn't work and there in front of everyone she shifted and in the process freaked everyone out and gave her father a heart attack that killed him.They explain to Leah what was going on and that she was a part of the pack and that Sam was the Alpha and she had to protect her tribe fromthe cold ones also know as vampires, An that she had to follow her Apha orders then Sam explainwhat being a wolf was about and how it changed there body's andabout imprints and how Emily was his imprint but Leah didn't care, she was just pissed that every time Samand she where shifted at the same time she had to see him with her orat the stupid meetings he wouldalways have. Every time she shifted one of the pack members would bring it up just to piss her off or teaseher about it, until she couldn't take itanymore and one day after patrol shewent home packed her stuff and left her mom understood, she saw howhard it was for her and even gave her some money and her car keys saying she knew this would come but she didn't think it would come so soon. She hugs and kissed her mother and brother goodbye and never looked back.She didn't stop until she reach Nashville where she got a small onebedroom apt. to live in with the money her mother gave her, a weeklater she had a job at a dinner making enough money to live off shewas only working there for twomonths, before she meant her mateIsabella 'bella' swan and from the moment they meant they knew they where mates, An it didn't hurt that they found each other attractive so when Leah took her order they flirted, Bella left a big tip and later that night when the dinner was closed Leah saw Bella standing there waiting to talk to her. From then on they hung out all the time went on dates and three months into the relationshipconfess what they are and that they where each others mate, Leah was at first surprise to see Bella's shifter wolf because it was bigger than Sam and its fur was white as snow with sky blue tips and with her electricblue eyes it made it hard not to Stare at how beautiful she was, butthen something special happened she watched Bella changed colorsand sizes right before her eyes. After that Leah meant Bella's pack mates4 other girls and 2 guys so it was Bella as Alpha Santana as beta hermate Quinn, Emily an her mateHanna then there's the guys Djand his mate Paul they hit it off great and became one big family.Leah didn't join the pack at first because she was also anAlpha but Bella told her that it didn'tmatter they where a family and your my mate so your apart of the pack for life baby, and they've been togetherever since Bella owns a few company's so they didn't need to work but still could if they wanted too. Now she sat in her office at home which she shares with the pack she could hear them all in the house either watching TV or playing a game or reading, while she sat in her office with a drink in her handthinking about her mothers birthdaythat's in two days which will make her 45. An how much of a surprise it would be to go, she can picture the look on her mothers face and howher mother would love that as a present."I think we should go" says Bella standing in the door frame with a smile on her face wearing basketball shorts and a t shirt."should go were" Leah asked her a little confused as too what she is talking about.Bella smiles before walking intothe room and sitting down next to Leah and pulling her to straddle her lap after resting he hands on Leah's waist "I'm talking about you going home for you mothers birthday I think we should go" she saysLeah smiled before kissing her onthe lips "don't get me wrong I want tobut that would also mean seeing the pack and I know for a fact that would lead to some kind blow out" I said running my fingers through her hair"who cares it's not like they can do anything to you and if they try we'll stop them and just think of the look on your mother and brother face come on baby it's time for you to go home." Bella replied squeezing my waist as reasurrance"What about my job and the pack we can't just leave Bella these things take time" I said trying to find a way out of going"That my darling is what I call bullshit the pack can come with us or stay if they want but i'm guessing they'll want to go cause your family and we protect our family, An work is a sad excuse I mean couldn't you think of something else your the boss for Christ sake what are you going to do fire yourself." Bella say with a laughsmiling up at meAll I could do was smile at her for a moment before leaning in to kiss her with all the love I have for her, she always knows what to say and how to make me feel safe and make me smile pulling back I give her a peck "Okay" I tell her before kissing Her again."Is that a okay as in okay we'll go" Bella asks pulling away from me with a hopeful express that just makes me laugh"yes we'll go but we have to askthe pack if they want to go.." I'm cut off by a voice clearing there throat by the door turning my head I see the pack standing there with smiles on there faces."Of course we'll come your family and we have your back and I don'tknow about the rest of these bitches but I have been dying to see whereyou lived and to push my foot up Sam's ass."
