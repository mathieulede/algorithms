Disclaimer: I don't own twilight. If kink isn't your thing, don't read. Above all else, don't judge.This one's for me.1: The ProfileI hesitate.I really want to do this. I've thought about it for so long, I've planned and plotted, created a whole new online identity for myself - and always, at this point, I lose faith and close the browser window.Only this time, I click the button. 'Submit', it reads, which make me snort and smile.There's still a profile to fill out, and a long questionnaire. I have to look up so many things, some of them scare me, others make me want to touch myself so badly.Another click, the deed is done. I flee, and wait impatiently.
