Never be the last one to know a secret.Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.If you want to keep a secret, you must also hide it from yourself.A secret's worth depends on the people from whom it must be kept.BPOVIf you listen long enough you will hear more than you ever want to know. I listened to the people around me my entire life. I could tell you who was cheating on their taxes, their wife or girlfriend. Most of the time it served me no purpose, however, as I grew older and listened more closely, I found out information that was important. Information that I couldn't share if I wanted to stay alive.EPOVI never asked for permission to do anything. I never had to watch what I said or did. I also never had to work hard at getting a girl to look my wayuntil she came to town. She turned my world upside down and I was simply along for the ride. Just when I got her to look my way, I found out my actions caused her world to fall apart. Now, I have to decide if I should live the lie or risk losing her.
