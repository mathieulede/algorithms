I can't not until I know she's ok, she may be a big hard wolf but she's still my little girl"Jake nodded and we sat there in silence I could help but notice his slight erection so I decided to take myself off to the bathroom and prepare myself for bed.I ran the water and rinsed my face off and started applying my moisturiser when I heard the front door slam shut, I ran into the bedroom so see jake jumping up out of bed, he looked slightly concerned."Jacob what's wrong"He didn't answer me he just headed for the door, so I followed we walked into the kitchen to see our daughter staggering around the kitchen island."Ohhh hey guys" she slurred throwing her bag across the kitchen "oops" she said before laughing."Jasmine Isabella black are you drunk"She shook her head before hiccuping a little then laughing."Jasmine what do you think your playing at" jake yelledShe shrugged her shoulders and walked over to the fridge."I could really use some chicken" she said rumerging through our food.What was she doing, jasmine never ever acted up like this she was such a good girl, something was wrong. I walked over to the fridge and pushed her up and slammed the door shut."Jasmine what the hell do you think your doing"She looked a little stunned that I raised my voice usually I was good cop."What does It look like" she said waving the plate of chicken around."Just wait till tomorrow young lady your in deep trouble!" Jake yelled at her"Oh I see well i guess we know now don't we" jasmine slurred walking towards the stairs"Jasmine what are you talking about"She snapped around to face me"What am I talking about!? Maybe the fact you favour Evie,Callum and Ella over me"I was shocked I never knew she felt like that"Jasmine we don't favour them over you, your all equal"Jasmine now looked a little mad"Oh really, so when Callum came in drunk the other week you weren't mad at him but your mad at me, and oh heavens forbid i wanted to move in with my boyfriend but the second Evie wants Seth to move in, you both welcome him with open arms"My attentions were taken away from jasmine went Evie and Seth appeared at the top of the stairs looking sleepy."Jas what the hell are you doing" Evie asked her voice sounding tired"sorry did I disturbed the prodigal daughter and son in law my mistake" jasmine yelled before storming up the stairs pushing past Evie and Seth on the stairs and then I heard the bedroom door slam.Jasmine POVI slumped down in my bed and let my tears run freely down my face, it was true my mom and dad did favour my siblings over me, around two weeks ago, it was nearly 2am when Callum trailed in drunk! Yes he maybe did ask permission to go to this party before hand but he still should of got in trouble for waking everyone up at 2am singing 'she wolf by Shakira' but no mom and dad both found it highly amusing and then went back to bed! Oh and then a few months ago Seth decided to to come out to Evie and tell her he had imprinted on her when she was born! So now there in a relationship and Seth gets to live with us! But when I brought up me and my boyfriend Luke moving in together all hell broke loose! Yes maybe we do argue a lot but we still love each other! I still don't understand why Seth imprinted on Evie, I mean we look exactly the same! I don't fancy Seth but still how could he find Evie more attractive when we are each other's clones! I put my pyjamas on and sat back down on my bed sniffling a little when I heard a small knock on the door."Who is it""It's ok jas it's just me" it was Evie, ok her I didn't mind seeing.She walked in and gave me a sympathetic smile."I brought you some water, mom said you'll need it in the morning" she placed the glass of water on my nightstand and sat on the edge of my bed."Jas what's going on" she asked in a small voice"Nothing"She moved further towards me and stared at me"Jasmine your my twin I know when something's wrong now talk to me"The tears were now flowing down my face again. Fuck."Jas don't cry" Evie said jumping toward me and hugging me tightly."It's.. Just not fair"She pulled away a little and looked at me "what's not fair"I wiped the tears from my eyes and looked at her"You, and Ella and Callum all get what you want but not me"Evie let out a small chuckle she obviously thought this was amusing."Oh jas you really have no idea do you"I was now confused"Seth is only living here because well one I'm his imprint, he can't stand to be away from me for long and two his mom kicked him out"Wow I didn't know his mom kicked him out"Did she really kick him out"Evie nodded "don't say anything to him, he doesn't like to talk about it, but jas it took a bit of convincing to get mom and dad to let him move in"I nodded "but Callum and Ella still get there own way"She laughed again wow this bitch was heartless"Callum is older than us jasmine, and mom and dad knew were he was, you on the other hand were suppose to be going to the movies and catching a bite to eat before you came home"Ok maybe she did have a point there "Ella though"She nodded "ok yes Ella is a spoilt brat"We both laughed together, i was suddenly feeling a lot better, I hugged my twin tightly "love you sissy" I murmured into her neck as I hugged her "love you too jas" she said as she got off my bed and left my room.
