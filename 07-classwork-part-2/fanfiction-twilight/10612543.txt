I ran into the small building, I had a pillowcase full of our clothes under my shirt giving me a pregnant appearance. My black duffel was heavily weighing down one shoulder; my blonde child beside me was no longer blonde as she runs to keep up. I was now in black leggings, a baggy, white tank that I tucked into my leggings. I had a comfy, grey, hooded jacket with a hoodless black leather jacket over the top, pink converse on my small feet. My now short, dyed blonde hair touched the bottom of my neck that connected to my shoulder was hidden under the grey hood. My baby was in a Monsters Inc onesie, with the hood hiding her now ginger hair with a hoodless, purple, leather jacket and purple UGG boots on. I pulled her along to the coach; we hopped in and sat on the left side seats. Darkness had devoured outside, the moon being the only natural light. The coach set off, finally and I let out a breath I didn't realise I was holding as I took the pillowcase from beneath my top and putting it in the duffel.
