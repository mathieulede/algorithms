Warning this story is rated M for a reason if your underage dont read it will get graphic at some point- -My Edward in this story is dark possesive and a total asshole -Bella is a total bitch you might not like her but thats ok you don't have toAlso this story got inspired by 2 songs True love way BY KINGS OF LEON hence the Tittle I love the way you lie by Eminem & RihannaDISCLAIMER I DO NOT OWN TWILIGHT BUT SOMEWHERE IN MY SICK MIND I LIKE TO THINK I DO...READ ENJOY IF NOT GO TO HELL }=0)POUND-POUND-POUNDI cringed each time I hear the rhythm of the sound; I look around to see how many people have heard it- could it be possible its just me, I hate knowing he's in there with her.I look across the room I make eye contact with Alice she gives me a sad smile- yes she knows my infatuation with him but just her, I might be petite and quiet at times, have the balls to stand for what I believe, I might also get in fights in bars beat the shit out of any guy or girl who talks shit to my friends or me I don't take shit from no one; but funny shit I don't have the balls to tell him how I feel, how pathetic am I? I notice James whispers something into Allys ear, James is her boyfriend of 2 years they met when she went to a Christmas party at her job she was new and fresh out of college, she's 25 and he's 27 she's a clothes designer and her boss Victoria just loves her work, if Victoria only knew she's going to loose her very soon Ally plans to open her own boutique. I notice James is kissing her neck, I look away feeling like if I'm intruding on a private moment I look towards Emmet- he's Alice older brother.Do I need to explain he's look? Just put it like this he would make a great bodyguard for the president, he's cute 6'0 feet tall with brown curly hair with big blue eyes he's the total opposite of Alice she's a pixie so freaking tiny with hazel eyes short spiky hair, I think its black-blue I can't even tell what kind of color it is but It works for her.Desperate to get away from the pounding, I get up from the couch where I was sitting and make my way to the kitchen to grab my self a beer, I notice most of the guest are bit passed buzzed."Remind me again why I came to this party" I hear Emmet ask behind me, I turn around and smile at him before answering."You know I don't even know what I'm doing here my self" I tell him, he hands me a beer which I thank him and drink as if my life depended on it."but I'm bored as fuck, I think the reason we both came is because of your sister that damn pixie is the Devil's child" I tell him, pointing to her I shake my head remembering the threats she said if we didn't show up."You want to have some fun?" he asks me wiggling his eyebrows, I burst out laughing I can see he's devious smile"what are you thinking?" I ask- god I know I'm going to regret it but anything is better than to sit around hearing them go at it."well I just came from outside and well they're playing beer pong want to play?" he asked with a hopeful smile"you know I'm too fucking sober for this party" I answer"Is that a yes?" he asks I put my empty beer bottle down at a nearby table and start walking towards outside leaving a confused Emmet behind.I look over my shoulder and ask"Are you coming or what? I need a partner" I tell him- he smiled so big that I think he's cheeks are going to split."Hell fucking yea!" he yells with a fist pump on the air, I laugh at he's enthusiasm.Its just us two against some guy's who work for Emmet- Emmet is 27 and he owns his own shop he's a mechanic, a couple of he's workers are here, I know some of them for the same reason that my truck has been towed to his shop for a lot of fucking problems, I think I need a new car, my old truck is ancient- time for an upgrade I guess."Hey Jake my man!" Emmet bellows to the Jake in front of us they do the one arm hug thing that all man do."Emmet what's up" Jake says looking at me with a smile"Well Bella here and me would like to play some beer pong are you up for a little competition?" he asks wiggling he's damn eyebrows again"Hell yea bring it baby" Jake says coming closer to me, I just shake my head and laugh I haven't played this since I was in college."Are you ready to loose to a girl baby?" I ask in a sultry voice, I notice him shiver and I smirk knowing I did that to him, all of the guys who heard started whooping."Let the games begin doll face" he says, he winks at me before walking toward he's side of the tableI look at Emmet and I nod my head letting him know I'm ready."Lets show them who's the boss baby girl" Emmet whispers in my ear while holding me by my waist, a smirk at him knowing full well that Emmet is a master at this.2 hours later and many beers which I lost count of how many cups did I emptied out, I feel buzzed everything seems to be spinning around me.The music around me seemed to have gotten louder, I giggle knowing its probably just me"What are you laughing at" Jacob slurred out, I start giggling again"I think your all drunk" I slur out, I notice Emmet has a buzz going too."Did you have fun now My Bella?" asked Emmet with a happy grin"You know what baby E I'm glad its Saturday I don't think I could have gone to work if it were to be Sunday night my ass probably wouldn't want to get up the next morning" I slurred out.All of the guy that were around the table watching the match just started to laugh"Hey I want to dance!" I yelled, I grabbed Jake and Emmet by the arm and started dragging them to where everyone was dancing, I saw a spot where I wanted to take them- I pushed Emmet in front of me while I left Jake behind me. A song that I liked started playing I knew this song and I started grinding my ass against Jake while I sang along to it'Got up in the club, posted in the backFeeling so good, looking so badRocking this skirt, rocking this clubGot my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck'I stuck both of my fingers up in the air showing them I didn't really give a fuck- I pressed my back to Jake as I slid down; rubbing my hands on Emmet chest.'Rocking this diamonds, I'm rocking this chainsMake sure you get a picture, I'm rocking this fameTo be what you is, you gotta be what you areThe only thing I'm missing is a black guitar' I looked at Emmet under my eyelashes while I bit my lip, all I heard was a low grunt and 'fuck'I turned around and started grinding against him, he grabbed my hips and pulled me to him I could feel his very prominent bulge, I smirked and looked at Jake his eyes were hooded with lustTo torture him a bit I licked my lips and moaned. I could hear all the guys around us were whooping, Emmet's breath hitched when I push my ass more to his bulge and started singing loude.'Six inch walker, big shit talkerI never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalkerSo baby take me in, I'll disobey the lawMake sure you frisk me good, check my panties and my bra.Wild 'n' out a crazy house with my white jacket onWon't you come and sign me outTo be what you is, you gotta be what you areThe only thing I'm missing is a black guitar'I moved away from both of them, I closed my eyes and started swaying my hips back and forth with both my hands up in the air. I knew I was drunk but at this moment right now I didn't give a fuck I wanted to loose my self forget about him about our fucked up relationship everything and everyone I wanted to just have fun!.'Hey I'm rocking out tonight 'cause I can't wait 'til tomorrow I'ma live my whole life in the night 'cause I ain't got time to borrowI'm rocking out tonight Why wait 'til tomorrowI'ma live my whole life in the night'I kept dancing until I felt some arms around me, I opened my eyes to see who it was, I was a bit disappointed not seeing the color I wanted, I got blue instead of green."Bella" Emmet whispered huskily against my neck, I can smell the alcohol on his breath"Emmet" I replied noticing my voice was the same as husky as his"want to have more fun tonight?" he asked, I looked at him, his eyes were hooded"what are your plans?" I asked"We can go somewhere more private" he said while looking me in the eye.We have never crossed any line me and him we have always been friends, nothing has been romantically between us always friendly, shit I didn't even know if he had any feelings towards me.I notice he started to lean in, right away I understand what he's trying to do so I start to lean in our lips are almost brushing all we need is for one of us to lean in a bit more and cross the line of friendship.Epv:I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels likeAnd fuck right now this is suffocating me.I'm fucking pussy for not telling her how I feel about her, but fuck she must be blind to not see it she should see the hints when I'm possessive of her it wasn't always like that for us it just started when I realized that I liked her more than a friend. The first time I snapped is when she brought her date Marcus over to Emmet's place we were doing a BBQ, that fucker leaned in and grabbed her ass right in front of me, I beat the shit of that guy, she lost her cool and slapped me I was full of rage I kept yelling at her.Since then I can't stand the fact to see any idiot of a guy around her the same shit goes with her she can't take it when a girl is around me or flirts with me, we are some complicated idiots.I rub my face cause this whole situation is fucking ridiculous, I mean I stay away for the same reason what if we take it to the next level it doesn't work out then what?fuck I'll probably loose her friendship and that's the last fucking thing I want.I get startled out of my thoughts when I feel a hand starting making its way down to my dick, I sit up in one swift movement and get out of bed I start to get dress this chick only distracted me for a while, I only wanted some release.When I walked in and saw how Bella was dress in that black tunic dress with them high boots, I wanted to run my hands up her legs reaching the promise land she looked so fucakble-Fuck just thinking of it- it's getting me hard again."Mmm where are you going baby" blond chick says in a voice she thinks its sexy.Trust me babe it's not- when you have heard a voice like Bella's no ones voice is sexy for you anymore"Thanx for the lay but I got to go" I tell her instead i start putting my shoes on, I hope James the pixies boyfriend doesn't mind that I used he's guest room to get some ass.I finish getting ready I look back at the girl she's still putting her pants back onI give her my signature crooked smile and turn to walk out the room without saying bye or asking for her name, yes cause I'm an asshole like that but Hey don't fucking judge me.I make my way through the crowd of people, I look around to see if I can find any of my friends I spot Alice first, I make my way to her she's standing by the sliding doors to the backyard."Hey Ally" I greet her with a kiss in the cheek, she doesn't respond she stays still just looking out her mouth making a perfect 'o' I follow her gaze I see Bella dancing in between who it seems to be Emmet and some other guy I know him I seen him around Ems shop but I never asked who he was all I know he's a worker, the way she's dancing with them makes me see Red.That piece of shit of a mongrel has his paws on her. I don't worry about Emmet, I know he would never make a move on her, he has told me himself that he doesn't see her like that.No one knows what I feel for her but soon I will tell her and everyone will know she belongs to me."Who the fuck is that with Bella, Ally?" I didn't think it was possible for my eyes to get any darker. I was just proved wrong."Who the fuck is he Alice?" the muscles in my arms flex as I clenched and unclenched my hands.She ignores me, James looks at me from the corner of his eyemost of the party is surrounding them.I start to make my way to them when I see Emmet grabbing her from her waistHe's whispering something to her in her ear, I hope is to tell her to go home and get some rest.I freeze in my spot for a second seeing what's about to take place, I seethe he fucking promised it was just friendship, I walk full speed taking my shirt off"Edward - Edward wait" I hear Alice yellThey are about to kiss- I reach them I push him off, they look startled to see me"What the fuck bro" Emmet yells at me, I can smell the alcohol in his breath but at this point I don't care who he is, all I want its fucking blood and I don't care who's is it"What the fuck are you doing with my girl bro" I keep clenching and unclenching my hands getting in his face"Fuck you asshole I ain't your fucking girl!" she yells I look at her I can see she's mad and she looks fucking beautiful but I don't care that she's mad and she knows that"Go back to that whore you were just fucking in that room" she sneered- I'm taken a back that she noticed what I did if she only knew I did it because of her."YOU. ARE. MINE" I say through clenched teeth looking at her .. By now everyone has stopped dancing all eyes are on us but I don't give a fuck I turn to him"You don't want to fight me bro" I said clenching my fist I can feel the veins in my arm pop out"What the fuck bro she ain't your fucking girl" Emmet says that's all it took for me to pounce..I attack I don't care about the screaming that's going around I'm one sick motha fucker and I'm after bloodI take a couple of punches but I recover quick, I duck and swing landing punches on him but the asshole won't go down."You stupid son of a bitch she's my girl" I yell as I land a punch on his ribs."STOP JUST FUCKING STOP!" she screams in my earWe get separated by James and some of he's friends, she comes at me"You stupid son of a bitch!" she screams while punching me in the chest and across the face.This hasn't been the first time we have gotten like this I lost count of how many fights I have gotten because of her. The most recent one it's the one with one of her colleagues Mike fucking Newton bastard thought he could get in her pants on the first date, over my dead fucking body asshole. I went and stayed at her place the day she told me to stay away I gave her the excuse I wasn't feeling well and I wanted to stay with her because I felt lonely, took the bastard to the side told him to take a hike he didn't listen so I punched him and threaten him that next time he wouldn't be so lucky. Didn't think he would go running to her like a lost puppy to say the least she was beyond pissed she was fuming but she looked Hot being mad so I didn't give a damn about the argument she forgave me right away."Why did you have to hit him, he didn't do anything I didn't want to" she yelled while slamming her small fist against my chest."You wanted him to kiss you" I screamed at her loosing my temper again"You wanted his hands all over you is that it huh? Tell me that's not what your thinking Bella cause I fucking swear I will-""You'll do what tell me what the FUCK will you do" she screamed throwing her hands in the air" You know what Fuck you asshole!""Stop calling me an asshole, bitch.""Stop being one, jackass!""I'm not an asshole!""Yes, you are!""I'm not!""Yes, you are!""No, dammit!""You so are, jackass!"The air around us was crackling with tension, anger and sex. Though I won't admit to the latter. Our fight was now silent. You could hear a pin drop in the usually loud partywe stared deep into each other's eyes. Waiting for the other one to break away first"You know what I'm capable of" I said in a low voice looking directly in her eyes"Don't threaten me because you know what I'm capable of doing" she said in the same low voice.Let me know what you think should i keep going or just get one more chpter and kill it there?... let me reviews dont be lazy assholes i would like to know what you think!
