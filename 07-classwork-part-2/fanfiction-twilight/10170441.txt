366 days NOT to fall in love with himBy: Distressed MistressWelcome readers. First of all, to those who dislike the idea of my Peter and my Elizabeth on their way to Nirvana, then feel free to press that little button with an arrow pointing to your left. This fictional story about nonfictional characters is still considered fictional. So, don't over react much. These are all based on my imagination and nothing more.Or is it?*shrugs and smiles* Of course it is.Rated M for later chapters. Prologue"I can't just sit here and watch him touch you the way I have! The worst part is? I have absolutely nothing to do about it!""Damn it, be professional Gavin! There's nothing going to happen between us! He's happy with his girlfriend and the same goes for us!""You've been working together for five consecutive years Liz. Look straight into my eyes and tell me. Tell me that you haven't fallen for him. Not even once.""I haven't. We didn't even have enough scenes-""Yes that's the whole point! Now that you have a movie to work with that revolves around how your character and his character fell deep shit in love, the two of you will have enough scenes to want to bang each other. I wasn't worried when you had that phone call, but when I first laid eyes on the script and saw how you were paired up with that guy...""Fine, if this is what you want. Just fine. I'll play your little game. Let's see how long you'll last without screwing with another woman,""I bet you can't take your hands off him after your shooting,""Damn it Gavin. I love you, but damn all of this,""I know Liz. You'll have my heart again and by the end of year, you'll never be touched by any man but me,"A/N: Leave a review & keep updated.Cheers,disYmis
