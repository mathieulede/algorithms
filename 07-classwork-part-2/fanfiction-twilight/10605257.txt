Nobody wants me,Nobody needs me,all I have to call my own is this hollow carcas.Sad.Alone.Pathetic.Depressed.Emotionless.Unnoticed body and soul, all my life craves is a true life, with love, joy and hope to keep me going.But he left and tore all these things away leaving me cold and crumpled like a paper bal on the floor wishing that the world had soe kindness left in it to let the bone constricting pressure kill me, but alas the world is dark and distorted in cruelty.Why do I try to put the facade on knowing it fools nobody when there is nothing and now nobody to try and be something for.Because I am plain, boring, useless and now he finally noticed what I tried to hide amongst my soul.This means though that in his black heart he did indeed touch my soul, even if only to rip it to a thousand shards of glass.
