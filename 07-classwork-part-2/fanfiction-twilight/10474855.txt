Author's Note: This is the first installment in my new series 'Until It Breaks', based on the equally titled one-shot which I have taken off. I hence apologize to those of you who read UIB  you'll already know the major theme of the story. Sorry. I hope you enjoy it anyway.Disclaimer: Stephenie Meyer owns Twilight. I am not making any financial gain from this, and no copyright infringement is intended.PrologueDreams. Treasured and valued since the early beginnings of human civilisations, they have decided millions and millions of fates over the millennia. Separated into good and bad dreams, they entertain us, scare us, take us and show us what we have possibly been ignoring all along. Dreams are the voice of our subconscious  and so, until today, we depend on them for better judgement of complex situations.But what if our dreams became reality?There is an invisible line, fragile and delicate, that separates the world of our subconscious wishes and fears, commonly referred to as 'dreams', from the harsh world of reality. Once broken, there is no turning back. Once broken, reality and dreamworld blurr into one, resulting in total chaos where we are at the mercy of our deepest, most secret desires. In other words  once broken, we are entirely at our own mercy.Alike magnets, we attract our positive desires, in the silent hope to keep our not so pleasant ones away. Yet we cannot bring ourselves to enjoy them, unconditional fear constantly dominating our mind. We live in a safe, yet unsatisfying bubble. Until it breaks.My name is Ava Jo Kelling, and I am slowly but inevitably falling apart.
