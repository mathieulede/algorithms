Moving to an island sounds like an escape from life and that was exactly what I was hoping to find. It wasn't that my life was terribly tragic, only that it was mundane. I needed a change in the daily routine, something to get me out of my box. Books could only take me away for so long from the predictable schedule of work and friends. It was a book that brought me to the location of my newest home. Prince Edward Island isn't the ideal island getaway that most would picture; however reading about the island through the eyes of a favorite childhood character sparked the desire to see the land first hand.Once the idea took hold I couldn't wait to begin the adventure. Saying goodbye to the small town of Forks didn't take long and neither did packing up my belongings. Being 22 years old and living with my dad, Charlie, was never the dream I'd had for myself. While I'd miss his quiet presence, I knew this move was the right one. At least I hoped it was.
