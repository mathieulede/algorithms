As the Sun SetsPreface:I'd given a lot of thought to how I'd die in the past few months and let me tell you  this wasn't it. Not even once had this crossed my mind.Surely there were worse ways to die. At least this was to save someone I loved. I'd rather be dying by him, not for him, but I guess if I have to die this was maybe sortanoble?I knew if I'd never gone to Forks I wouldn't be facing death now  hell, if I'd made any one of a thousand choices differently since I got here I wouldn't be facing death now, at least not like this. But if that were the case I also wouldn't have the stories I have now. My life would have been boring and really  who wants that?I took a breath, shaking my head and looking into the dark eyes of my hunter. "That all you got?"He smiled pleasantly at my question as he sauntered forward to kill me.A/N: If you're like me and thought that the beginning of Twilight kind of dragged on forever, then you're probably going to think the same of my story (trust me, I thought so writing it). There's not much I can do about it because I'm following the book so closely. Worst case scenario, jump ahead to when you started actually liking the book and go from there. You know the story  you won't miss much. :)I said it in the summary so that I wouldn't have to say it everywhere else so here is the last time I'm going to say it. SM owns the story which I am taking nearly everything from. The only thing I could even maybe possibly say I have any sort of "ownership" over is the changes to Bella's personality.Reviews are appreciated. Do you like the way the story is going, or do you wish I deviated from SM's version a bit more? Let me know! I read and respond to every review.Updates are at minimum weekly, usually biweekly. Maybe three times a week if reception of my last chapter is good and I get inspired.PM me if you want to be a pre-reader/beta.Thanks for your time and hope you enjoy!~ J3SS
