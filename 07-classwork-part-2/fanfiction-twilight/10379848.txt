Black was the last thing I saw. Everything was black. the sky, the grass. Black was even the last thing I heard. If you can hear it. Black has a high tone. It's a beautiful color, black. it's deep, it understands you. it knows you. it even speaks to you when you almost die. But everyone's black has his own voice. High or low. Mine was a beautiful velvet voice. To me it said: " don't forget me." But what if you don't know what you can't forget. What if you couldn't remember anything in your live. What if the only thing you can see are black memories.That is me. I don't remember anything. I woke up from a coma and I didn't have a clue who I was, where I was and who the people were around me. I know now that my name is Isabella Marie Swan. I have a father, a mother and a stepfather. Their names are Charlie, Renee and Phil. I don't know if it's true. They can tell me anything and I believe it. May be I aren't the girl who they said I am. May be they are my kidnappers and everything is a act. The doctors, the people and the hospital. I don't know.Because who am I, I'm a blind girl with no memories.
