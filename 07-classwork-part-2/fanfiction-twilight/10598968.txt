PrefaceAll rights besides the Plot and OC belongs to the best creator of (sparkly) vampires, Stephanie Meyer. Please enjoy and review! I know its short, but I have another chapter coming on its way in like five minutes, complicated. 8/6/14. I always thought like most people did that death would come at a time of old age or at least it lasted longer than this. My heart beat fast and strong; it was healthy and not the cause of my death. I watched as my sister starred fearlessly into the dark eyes of the hunter with a paniced yet accepting look on her face.It was apparent in her deep, milk chocolate eyes that I could only dream of possessing that she thought this would all be worth it. In a way it had been meeting, Jasper and all of the other Cullen's and at the end of the day it would all be worth it and I'd make the same choice over and over again, but it was all such a big tease now knowing that it would all be over.At least for me, what awaited would be the end.Taking a single last glance at my crazy, selfless, brave sister who I would do anything for I gave her a one last smile and before she could process what that meant, I jumped at the hunter and watched as the anticipation in her hungered eyes grew and I beamed. If I was right Bella was going to have her happily ever after fairy tale that she deserved more than anybody.I closed my eyes waiting for his sharp, starved bite to come and invite death in.
