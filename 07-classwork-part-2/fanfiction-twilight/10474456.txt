My husband James was killed in a car accident 7 months ago. Together we have a wonderful 2 year old son, named Riley. He's the most important thing in my life.My husband's death has had me thinking about a lot of things lately, especially Forks.I haven't been back there since I left for Chicago. In fact, I have tried my hardest to forget everyone and everything there. It just hurts too much to remember everything I went through there after I started highschool.There's just one problem that people face when they are trying to forget their past.Eventually, that past comes back to bite you in the ass.Hard.I won't tell you about how my past has caught up to me right now because to understand the problem I am currently facing, you have to hear about the events that occurred in my past that eventually led up to this moment in time.And so my story begins.
