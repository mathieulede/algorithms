Hi! Long time no see ;). I've tentatively started writing again and I can't begin to tell you how happy that makes me! Time is still short around here, so my offerings will be too so I can try and keep up with regular postings. I've never tried anything like this before so I hope it works!Gemma xDisclaimer: Stephenie Meyer owns all things Twilight.1.She's invading my thoughts again as I try desperately to fall asleep. Only five hours and thirteen minutes until my alarm will sound, forcing me out of bed. I panic slightly at the realization. I don't function well without sleep and I have tests in two of my classes tomorrow.My body's exhausted, but my brain runs at full speed. I haven't seen her in a while, but just the mention of her name slipping lazily and without respect from the guy standing pissing beside me in the boys' bathroom made me want to punch something. Not him; I'm not that guy. Besides, he wasn't even talking to me, which made it worse because his friend also seemed to know her a little too well for my liking.Isabella Swan: beautiful, mysterious, intelligent. Total emotional car crash.
