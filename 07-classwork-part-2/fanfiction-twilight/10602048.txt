A/N: SO I am having a little trouble continuing Blue Eyes. I am looking for a Beta who can help me finish the story, i will be giving it a week before I will be taking it down. I will take it down and try to continue it on my own spare time and I warn that it may be revised to help me finish it.But in the meantime, please enjoy this story...my very first OC so i hope you like it. Imagine being in love with someone for as long as you knew what love was and how it felt. IMagine that person loving your best friend, the way you want them to love you.I know I should stop and try to move on, to think of a better way to spend my days besides dreaming of a life with him. Thinking of what it would be like to be kissed by him or even loved by him for just a second. I know I should just let them be happy but how can I when he is all I think about.Its strange knowing that the one person i can tell anything too is the one person I can't confide in about him. You would think she would have guessed it right? Well I guess he isn't the only clueless one in this threesome.But if you wish enough and hard enough on a star, your wish might finally come true. Too bad it only took a Vampire, Imprinting, and Summer to fit the pieces together.
