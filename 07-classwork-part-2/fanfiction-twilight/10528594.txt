Hey Everyone so here is what's going on. You might realize that this is the same story but not the same author. Well its still me (lol) I just haven't written in a while and forgot my fanfic login (Oops!) So away I create a new one and here it is. Ill be retyping the first chapter and then continuing on. If you have any Ideas send em in or review them. I will try and use them. So please give me another chance? And see if the story is even worth you waiting around for?Thanks A Bunch!Yours,:)
