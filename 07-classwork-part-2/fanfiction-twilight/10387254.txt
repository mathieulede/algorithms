Hi, welcome to my new WIP! Please know that I don't have a beta so all mistakes are mine. This story is a dribble? drabble? (I get confused on which is which) format. Let's call it a crumble, because really, each chapter is a different size, and crumble comes in all sizes. Plus I love crumble, especially with cream. Now that was dribble.This story will update once a day until all finished. Please be warned that it contains snippets about teen pregnancy, abortion, teen sex, drugs etc. etc. If at any point in the story you feel you can't read on because of this, I want to thank you for trying anyway :) Now on with the crumble! (very short prelude, I promise they get longer from here)That GirlHigh school is a hard enough gig as it is, with its ruthless cliques and soul-less rumour mill. I was doing okay, no, I was doing incredibly well to stay out of both. Until the day that I stupidly landed myself in the latter.I am the girl formerly known as Izzy Swan. I am That Girl.That Girl that preferrs books over people.That Girl that sits with the chess club. Not because she plays chess, but because they were the only group that would let her sit in the empty seat at their table.That Girl that sneaked out and went to that one party during the school holidays. That party where she lost her virginity to the hot guy she'd been crushing on for years.I am That Girl that got knocked up in high school.
