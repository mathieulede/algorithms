Isabella Marie Black was waiting for her brother Jacob Black in the warm airport in Port Angeles, Washington. She looked and smiled as she felt two large hands cover her eyes and put her in complete darkness and turned around to see him except his hair was shorter, his muscles were bigger and he basically looked like a younger, little bit lighter of Sam. She was shocked just a couple of months ago when she visited he looked like his old self, beside him was Sam Uley he was 3 years older than the 16 year old and 2 years than her brother and Seth who was 14 and Leah who was 16. She hugged the 14-year-old boy laughing. "Hey Bells nice to see you again." Seth said and she smiled letting go. She turned to Leah and they hugged laughing."I can't believe you're back for good we seriously have to catch up.""Yeah um of course." She nodded and turned to Sam rolling her eyes. She never really cared for Sam so she just walked past him out of the airport into the passenger seat of Jake's truck."So Bells how are you." Sam said teasing her she rolled her eyes."Great, it is so great to be back in my home town the area I know." She looked at the cliffs as they past them and smiled. "Jake let's go cliff diving like we used too" She said smiling at her brother."Yea uh no." She pouted and sighed. "Any way I finished the bike so we should go for a ride." She turned to her brother smiling."Yes. I can't wait." She said as Jake turned off the truck and Bella jumped out of truck and ran into the garage looking at the finished bike grabbing her helmet off of a hook and put it on as she sat on her motorcycle that her and her brother fixed together and rode the bike out of the garage past her brother and Sam. "WHOOO! HELLO LA PUSH!" she yelled as she rode off.
