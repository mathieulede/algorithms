PrologueI really didn't mean for all this to happen. I fell in love with a guy, so what every girl has a right to do that , and it either end with marriage or they break up, see simple , then why did it have to turn into a catastrophe when it was me?! Why was it very extremely complicated? Does this happen often or is it just me?No matter how many times I asked these questions to myself I never found a reasonable enough answer.I gave him my love, attention, money and everything his heart desired, but clearly it wasn't enough.I fought everybody for him; I ignored all my friends' warnings, and telling them over and over that he is trustworthy even though my instincts were not supporting me fully. I caused all this with my foolishness. And even when I tried to run away my luck also felt the need to follow me.I fell in love with another guy, but this time he was the right one, like really THE ONE, but at a very bad and unsuitable timing. And then I asked myself a question ' Ugh, can my luck get worse than that?!' and unfortunately the answer to that question is... yes (a big fat yes).I am Bella Swan and this is my story.
