A/N: I did not write this god awful story (thank goodness). I've always wanted to do a commentary on a horrible fic like this, and even though I think it would be extremely fun to shred "My Immortal" like many others have, admittedly I have not read any of the Harry Potter books nor plan too. I know- I know, "My Immortal" seriously has nothing to do with the actual books/movies, but again, I don't know much about the characters (and apparently, nor does Tara). Anyways, here's the first chapter with commentary. Enjoy?AN hey guys this is the new improved verson of my story, hope its better this time! [A spelling error on the first sentence... hell maybe it is an improvement... a horrible, horrible improvement] btw i am young and have dyslexia i find spellin hard but its meant2 be unformal ok! ["Unformal", meaning "informal", doesn't mean you don't have to worry about your spelling, and I kinda find it hard to believe you are dyslexic; I think that's just another one of your excuses for being "unformal"] no critisism pls! [Um... no. When you post your works on the wonderful interwebs, expect it to be criticized. Get some backbone and improve your writing]  tis story goes out 2 my bf zac(kisses!) [Really? You wrote this story for your boyfriend? For what purpose?] amd my besfreind Tiffi LOVE YA GRRRL! EDWARD IS OUR GODD!(we wanna SEX him gud!) [Best friends forever.] love &blood; becky mac! xxx x x xxUPDATE: I have a proofreader [lies] and I have cleaned up the spelling and grammer on this chaptor a hell of a lot as you will see [Your sentence of reassurance tells me otherwise](thank u vickie!) i will be imrpoving the next chaptors soon. [I'm sure you will]Chapter 1 - Altantiana[You already spelled your own character's name wrong and we haven't even began the story yet!]Hey, my names Atlantiana Rebekah Loren (but everyone calls me Tiana or just plain Tiaa) [If she is called Tiana or Tiaa all the time, why not just make that her actual name? Giving her that outrageous name doesn't guarantee her to be a fan favorite or anything.]. I am a 16 year old girl and I live in Forks, Washington! [Radical!] My hair is long and pale like spun gold and skims to my waist like a pale shimmering amber mist. [Do that many similes really need to be used to describe your hair?] My eyes are deep forgetminot [forget me not] blue and my delicate fentures are lilly white and pure as the winter snow in moonlight. I've been told by loads of sleazy, ugly, HORNY guys that I'm real pretty and look like a model or a bunny girl [Because we all know that personality doesn't make a character.] (some of the guys who like me are really old and try to make opt with me its disgusting and weird!) [No shit. But tell me, were they really old and disgusting or REALLY old and disgusting?] but basically a lot of the girls I meet tell a different story. They say I'm too ivory white [ebony black] and ethereal and too skinny and that I look anorexic which i don't care about [Ha, I seriously doubt that], but I think its seriously disrespectful to people with REAL eating disorders [D'aww, so nice to see you have feelings for other people] (btw i'm so totally not anorexic! I eat loads I just never gain weight [How lucky of you] and I'm not thin enough to be anorexic anyways, I think they were just being BIATCHES especially this one ratty brain called Ellie Mayfair who I hope freaking DIES in PAIN with SHIT ON HER FACE! Sorry, I'm not really such a batch but she is SO horrible if you met her you'd think the same! [Oh Atlantiana, you acting like this just proves that you are no better than Miss. Ratty Brain])Anyways I am quite tall and slim and but with really big boobs that I used to HATE because they look noticeable on my slender body and draw to much attention but now i like them and don't care who stares at me [...Then they must be fake Atlantiana my dear, because girls as skinny
