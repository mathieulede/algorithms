Dreaming of B in Chicago (your city)Date: 10/14/11reply to ECDubHey B, it's E here. I'm sitting in a coffee shop in Chicago, about halfway towards, well I'm hoping, the start of something great. This city is amazing, but I can already say Seattle is going to be better because it has you.My journey west has been going smoothly so far. I met a guy in Ohio who told me he had let someone great slip away from him as well, but he didn't go after her and has been kicking himself in the arse since then. We then proceeded to get completely bladdered and started a one night only rock cover band. The night taught me two things. 1. that I am making the right decision in going after you. 2. Ozzy was right, you can't kill rock n roll no matter how much of the black stuff you ingest.I've been thinking about everything we talked about on our 8 hour flight. How you described the trees of Seattle and the way the city makes your soul happy, I just can't wait to get there. To see the place that made your eyes light up, I know I'm going to love it. The way it rains all the time reminds me of Dublin and I almost feel like I'm going home in some weird way.I still haven't heard anything from you, but I'm not discouraged yet. I start my bartending gig at McCarthy's in about 5 days and I hope you'll come around to see me. I don't mean to brag but I make a mean Irish coffee that you don't want to miss.Well, I'm going to get back on the road now. I've enjoyed the drive so far but I'm ready to be there and see if there's any hope for this lad. Thinking of you, B. Cheers.Authors Note: I am finally uploading these to my page so I can write a long overdue conclusion. :)
