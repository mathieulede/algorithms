A/N: Yes. I am back. I am hoping for weekly updates unless real life gets in the way. This is another story close to my heart. In 1943 at the age of 43, Kenneth Donaldson suffered a traumatic episode. After a brief hospitalization and treatment period, he resumed life with his family. Thirteen years later, while visiting his elderly parents in Florida, he reportedly believed one of his neighbors in his hometown of Philadelphia was poisoning his food. His father believed he suffered from paranoid delusions and petitioned the court for a sanity hearing. Donaldson was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was committed to the Florida State mental health system.He was provided with no legal counsel to represent his case.Surrounded by dangerous criminals in an understaffed facility, he was treated by the only doctor ever presentan obstetricianwho presided over 1,000 male patients. There were no psychiatrists nor counselors, simply the one doctor and his nurse.After 15 years of confinement against his will, Kenneth Donaldson sued the hospital. The case reached the US Supreme Court in 1975O'Connor vs. Donaldson.The Court ruled in Donaldson's favor. The decision meant it is now unconstitutional to commit for treatment a person who is not imminently a danger to himself or others and is capable to a minimal degree of surviving on his own.If only I'd been born in 1975.A/N: Love you guys. This one is tough and labeled angst, but not quite as tough as Vanished. Leave me a review and let me know what you think.
