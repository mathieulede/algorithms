A/N:Hey guys, this is my first fanfic so please review and let me know how I can improve. The actual chapter is going to be longer, I promise. Read and Review? Thanks! -AniaCrimsonWolfPrologueChildren, as anyone who deals with them can tell you, are born with a particular personality. There are serious, pensive babies who are still trying to solve some important equation, hyper babies who zoom into the world with absolutely no desire to eat or rest and easygoing babies who only want to flourish.But sometimes, very rarely , there are babies who appear to have swallowed some private sun, rosy and endlessly agreeable babies who will laugh not because you tickled them but because they are spending time with you. Gabriella Lynn Alden was a baby like this.Emily's face lit up with a gleeful smile the minute she finished reading the email. Annaleise, her best friend from school, had written to inform her that her little sister Gabriella was arriving in Forks on Thursday to do some sort of internship in Forks hospital. The reason Emily was so happy was because Gabriella Lynn Alden was one of the most amazing people she had ever met. She had a way of lighting up just about any room she walked into, a way of making people stop for a second and look at her, a grace that couldn't be learned. To know Gabby was to love Gabby. 'who knows,' she mutters to herself 'maybe one of the boys will fall for her'.
