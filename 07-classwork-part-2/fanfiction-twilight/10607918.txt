Hey guys! Here is another story idea that I've been sitting on for a bit, and I thought since today is my birthday, I'd give you guys a present from me. I do hope you guys like it! There is no posting schedule, but I do promise no more than a two week wait for a chapter, just like how it was with The Missing.I borrowed the title from this AFI song, which also helped me with writing coming up with this story. If you should want to listen: www dot youtube dot com/watch?v=aA2YkYHh1Ho (just take out the spaces and the dots)Thanks to Darcysmom for betaing and my pre-readers for all of their help with this one.
