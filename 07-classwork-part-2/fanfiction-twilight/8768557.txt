chapter 1A/N: Ok so I wanted to try and write another fanfic because this has just been stuck in my head, It's like a edward/bella, jacob/bella, and leah/edward story those are all the pairings that will happen in the story. In my story Bella wants to get rid of the baby and when she makes that decision her feelings for edward follow, leah is a little bit more kind, and calmer but not that much and Charlie and Rene' are still married, Sarah is not dead, and lastly Bella has a little brother named CJ he's not that important of a character but he will eventually make a apperance in this story so i hope you enjoy tell me what you think...and this story starts of where Jacob comes and asks Bella to have his baby instead and I haven't given up on my other story ...well enjoy :))JpovSeeing Bella dying before my eyes absolutely crushed me, I hoped this would work and she'd take my offer hell she didn't even half to do that she could have someone else's baby, anyone else's baby. As I made it to the door about to re-enter the Cullen's house, I was hesitant at first thinking what if she just laughed in my face, or told me I was discusting but I'd try anything and everything to make sure she would live even if it was'nt with me. then I conjured up enough courage to continued into their house when Bella came into sight it made my heart clench in my chest bringing me pain, I could'nt stand seeing her like that. He bones were visible through he skin, she was sickly pale, and she looked like she was going to kill over I plastered a fake smile on my face continuing my journey until sat on the ground close to where she was laying "hey" I said not smiling anymore "hey" she said forming her cracked lips into somewhat of a smile, that turned into a grimace that made me shart to panick a little "are you ok?" i asked you could hear the concern in my voice, she smiled again "yea she is just streching" she said rubbing her belly tenderly "poor baby doesnt have much room" she continued as she gazed at her belly.When she called that thing a 'she' i was confused i thought Dr. Vamp couldn't see the baby because of some kind of freakish skin or something "it's a girl" i asked still confused, she looked at me and shrugged ' I don't know Carlislte can't see her...At first I Thought for sure it was a boy but now I'm not sure why, vut i think she is a she" she said with a small smile I couldn't keep sitting here like everyting was ok, well here goes nothing "Bells...it's killing you" I said bluntly she frowned "she just a little to strong" she said looking at me "No...Bells your gonna die ..and I don't wanna sit around and watch I love you to much... Edward loves you to much.. What about Charlie or Rene' o-or little Cj...Bells can you rethink this we can't loose you..I can't loose you...If you want a baby so bad have one with someone else..anyone else as long as you live" I said I layed it all out there, did i really care about the leeches feeling no but she was playing dirty so, so would I.She looked in thought for a long moment it seemed like ieon before she spoke "what do you mean someone else's baby?" she asked looking a little irritated porbably because she thought i meant have some strangers baby "well I-I meant a baby that won't kill you, one that won't have to drink blood one wh-" I didn't get to finish because she cut me off "I feel like your rambling..you can tell me anything Jacob" she said with soft eyes "y-you could have my baby" I said but I didn't look at her for a long moment when I did she wore a blank expression which made me nervous "who's idea was this" she said still no emotion on her face, not even in her voice "Edwards" I sighed I knew she was gonna start yelling any second "and you agreed?" she asked me still emotionless, i nodded my head "ok" she said i looked at her confused "ok?" i asked she nodded and smiled "i don't wanna die and i do want a child yes i love this one but i love all you guy more" she said smiling. Which made me happy she was going to live, and have my child it was a win, win situation "we have to contact Carlislte and the others" I said hurrying out the room without another word the quicker we get this thing out the better.A/N: ok I hope you guys like this story i know it's slow but it'll pick up i promise don't forget to read and review, constructive critism welcome NO FLAMES because if you flame me i'll tell you to take that flame and shove it! anyway in each chapter i'll be doing two song and story recommendation so Tah Tah!SONG: I'M DIFFERENT- 2 CHAINZSONG: EVERYBODY TALKS- NEON TREESSTORY: HOLLOW- Nikkib1973STORY:LOVING THE SUN- Nikkib1973
