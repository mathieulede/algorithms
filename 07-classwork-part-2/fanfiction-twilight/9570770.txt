Disclaimer: I do not own Twilight, only my Oc's and the plot.The first chapter for the sequel to monster!If you haven't read Monster I encourage you to read it before this one. If not I'll include some things so you understand what I'm talking about. But you may be confused if the name Vivian pops up, and if Vivian doesn't equal crazy bitch to you. You obviously did not read Monster. Anyway to those who did read it.I'm back!I hope this is much better written than Monster. So without further ado here is the prologue.-True GoddessPrologueAlex's POV"How could you do this to me?"I asked looking into his eyes with hatred. Never in my life did I think I could hate someone so much."You were my friend Tyler!"He looks at me pleading for me to believe him."I didn't know Alex. I promise I didn't know."I shook my head."I don't believe you. You lead me to a trap, and you're pleading for me to believe you."He nodded."Yea I do. If I wasn't here to help you would I be trapped in here too?"He sighed shaking his head."I love you Alex."I blushed and looked away."I can't return those feelings Tyler."He nods."I know, it's why I have to do this."He lifted the bomb off the floor and opened the window."Tyler don't do it!"He shrugged a tear falling down his chin."How else can I prove to you I had nothing to do with this?""TYLER!"I screamed as I watched one of my best friends jump out of a window thirty stories high and fall to his death.So this is just the prologue. Now I have the annoying job of fitting everything in to lead to this unfortunate event. Anyway, review and tell me what you think. The first real chapter should be up soon.-True Goddess
