[Verse 1: Fantasia]
Ever felt so ugly, pretending that he loves me
Sometimes it’s just not money, never had to afford me
Now I’m sick and tired of you just taking right off
Knowing I'd forgive you
You ain’t here for dinner
Like I’m a beginner
I loved you for your inner, inner, inner
And the next guy is out there somewhere
But you won't dare cause you’re too scared

[Chorus]
Have you ever needed someone so bad?
But he ain’t willing to make it last
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again.
If it makes you cry, cry, cry
And all you do is fight
Can’t get no sleep at night
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again

[Verse 2]
Ever felt this sorry? All you did was worry
You didn’t want nobody, thought it would get better
But it’s falling more than
Oh it’s falling more than ever
I just hoped that we would
Cause you’re always up to no good
Maybe it’ll take someone else to show me better
But I don’t wanna leave ya

[Chorus]
Have you ever needed someone so bad?
But he ain’t willing to make it last
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again
If it makes you cry, cry, cry
And all you do is fight
Can’t get no sleep at night
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again

[Bridge]
Some of you know what it feels like
Caught up just in his life
Don’t wanna try again, thinking what’s the difference?
Why am I not interested?
Cause when you’ve been broken, you feel like no one can fix it
Yeah

[Chorus]
Have you ever needed someone so bad?
But he ain’t willing to make it last
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again
If it makes you cry, cry, cry
And all you do is fight
Can’t get no sleep at night
Sometimes you gotta lose to win again
