[Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down
By the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street
I hear

[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!"

[Hook]
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself
I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack
Or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac
And major pain
Not the drill sergeant
But the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan
YG Lucky
Ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly
Waving your hand
Out the window – Check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society
The driver seat
The first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine
Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine
We adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door
Fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for
If you ain't walking up
You fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump
Picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets coming from
AKs, ARs – "Aye y'all, duck"
That's what momma said
When we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn
All hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94
Fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty
Just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies
IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner
Between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley
Make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate
Or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect
All of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens
That shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest
That you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor
On speed dial, I guess
M.A.A.d city

[Hook]
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake your punk ass up
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah
Real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin' nigga)
Hood
(Sup cuz)
It ain't nothing but a Compton thang
G-yeah
How we do

[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school
'Cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room
Of my momma's pad
Reality struck
I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole
Two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job
I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month
And ended up leaving
In fact, I got fired
'Cause I was inspired
By all of my friends
To stage a robbery
The third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up
Gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt
Had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweakin'
The next weekend
We broke even
I made allegiance
That made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons
But still will never know my life
Kendrick – A.K.A. "Compton's Human Sacrifice"

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah
Cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixing shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis
It's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc
Yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under
So I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me
I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IVs with the fucking spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay
The street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy
Hearts turn brave
Mount up
Regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard
With the pistol grip
Trip
We in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap
'Cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome
A strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's
Where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen
Would you believe me?
Or see me to be
Innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball
And some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons
Would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence
Now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation
Maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn
They vandalizing
The option of living a lie
Drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive
Hit the powder
Then watch this
Flame that arrive in his eye
Listen coward
The concept is aim
And then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit
A price on his head
The tithes
Probably go to the projects
I –
Live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust
What

[Scratches]
M.A.A.d city
Compton

[Outro]
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn!
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holding it for
Niggas always acting unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up!
Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga?
Don't even trip
Just lay back and drink that
