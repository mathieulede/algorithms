Girl, you look exactly like my type
I don’t know who you came with tonight
But I can make your life a little better if you leave with me, yeah
Cause ain’t nobody fresher, yeah my steez too right
If you say you’re man is better, then I’ll know you a lie
We can get together, doing whatever you can think of
Believe me, girl
Your body’s telling me things your lips won’t say
And what I got, got you feenin', yeah you can’t wait no more
I know I’m gonna get more than your name, It's getting heavy
It seems like you're ready, don’t play with it, girl

Leggo, it’s about that time, girl
How bad you want it?
Leggo, hey girl, you’re a problem
I know I can solve it
Leggo, treat my body like a stage
Wanna see how you perform it
Leggo and we can go all night until the morning
Leggo! (Leggo (x6))
Leggo! (Leggo (x6))

I know I look exactly like your type
And I can leave with any girl here tonight
But I don’t really see nobody else but you, but you girl
From the second I stepped in, you caught my eye
From the minute I saw you, you’ve been on my mind
Looking at my wrist, it’s about that time, what you wanna do, girl?
Your body’s telling me things your lips won’t say
And what I got, got you feelin', yeah you can’t wait no more
I know I’m gonna get more than your name, It's getting heavy
And it seems like you're ready, don’t play with it, girl!

(Yeah, 2Chainz)
C-notes, kiss my ego
Denzel Washington mixed with Al Pacino
We know, everywhere we go
Black and white things with me, tuxedo
I am getting to the fritos
It’s a dope quarter, same color as a kilo
Slow it down, full speed ahead
The bottom of her shoes are even red
Got numerous positions in the bed
I think we gonna need another spread
And if your friend ain’t pitching in
Then we gonna need another friend
Got your love on blast I ain’t turning down
That’s my prerogative like Bobby Brown
What goes around comes back around
Now I'm back in town
