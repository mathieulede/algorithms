[Verse 1]
It’s been awhile, I’m not who I was before
You look surprised, your words don’t burn me anymore
Been meaning to tell you, but I guess it’s clear to see
Don’t be mad, it’s just a brand new kind of me
Can't be bad, I found a brand new kind of free

[Verse 2]
Careful with your ego, he’s the one that we should blame
Had to grab my heart back, God knew something had to change
I thought that you’d be happy
I found the one thing I need
Why you mad? It’s just the brand new kind of me
Never bad, I found a brand new kind of free

[Chorus]
It took a long, long road to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
It took one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, don't be surprised

[Verse 3]
If I talk a little louder, if I speak up when you're wrong
If I walk a little taller, I been under you too long
If you notice that I'm different, don't take it personally
Don't be mad, it's just a brand new kind of me

[Chorus]
It took a long, long road to get here
It took a brave, brave girl to try
I've taken one too many excuses, one too many lies
Don't be surprised, see you look surprised

[Bridge]
If you were a friend, you wanna get to know me again
If your were worth a while you would be happy to see me smile
I'm not expecting sorry, I'm too busy finding myself
I've got this, I've found me, I've found me

[Verse 4]
I don’t need your opinion, I’m not waiting for your okay
I’ll never be perfect, but at least now I’m brave
Now my heart is open, and I can finally breathe
Don’t be mad, it’s just a brand new kind of free
That ain't bad, it’s just a brand new kind of me
Don't be mad, its just a brand new time for me
