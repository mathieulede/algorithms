[Verse 1: Emeli Sande]

I can't buy your love, don't even wanna try
Sometimes the truth won't make you happy, so I'm not gonna lie
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you
I know I'm far from perfect, nothing like your entourage
I can't grant you any wishes, I won't promise you the stars
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you

[Hook: Emeli Sande]

Cause when you've given up
When no matter what you do it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
Thats when you feel my kind of love
And when you're crying out
When you fall and then can't pick your happy off the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around
That's when you feel my kind of love

[Verse 2: Emeli Sande]

You won't see me at the parties, I guess I'm just no fun
I won't be turning up the radio singing, "Baby You're The One".
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you
I know sometimes I get angry, and I say what I don't mean
I know I keep my heart protected, far away from my sleeve
But don't ever question if my heart beats only for you, it beats only for you

[Hook: Emeli Sande]
Cause when you've given up
When no matter what you do it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
Thats when you feel my kind of love
And when you're crying out
When you fall and then can't pick, you're heavy on the ground
When the friends you thought you had haven't stuck around
That's when you feel my kind of love
Cause when you've given up
When no matter what you do it's never good enough
When you never thought that it could ever get this tough
Thats when you feel my kind of love
