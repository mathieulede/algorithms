[Intro: Justin Bieber]
PYD, PYD, PYD
PYD, PYD, PYD, I'mma put you down
PYD, PYD, PYD
PYD, PYD, PYD, I'mma put you down
PYD, PYD, PYD, all the way down, woah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
From the door to the wall, coffee table
Girl get ready, I'mma put you down, all the way down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
From the stove to the counter top, dining room table are you ready?
I'mma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
Up the stairs to my bedroom, light a few candles brace yourself
I'mma put you down, all the way down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
On a plane, a train, an auto mobile doesn't matter
I'mma put you down, all the way down (PYD, PYD, PYD)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And it donâ€™t make no sense, to be that bad
I'mma take it down on you babe, put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
This will show you how much I love you, form of appreciation
I'mma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ooh cause you deserve the best and nothing but the best
So I give you the best you've ever had
I'mma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'mma put you down

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
On the roof, balcony, we don't care who sees
Girl I'mma put you down, all the way down down down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
After the club in the parking lot, I don't care anyone who could pick the spot, whatever
I'mma put you down, yeah, all the way down, yeah (PYD, PYD, PYD)
Cause I've been doing forensics on your body in this club
And I can tell the way you walk yo body ain't been touched the right way
It seems yo man been treating you like a step-child
Sub 'em out, sub me in and I'mma get on the floor and shut the whole game down
Until I hear you cheering babe
Have you spelling out my name babe
See I wanna give my love
Be your dope man in the bedroom, you can make me your drug babe

[Pre-Chorus: R Kelly]
And it don't make no sense, to be that bad
Oh no, baby, I'm gonna put you, down
Gonna show you how much I love you
Form of  appreciation yeah, no (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Justin Bieber]
Oh cause you deserve the best and nothing but the best
So I'll give you the best you've ever had
I'm gonna put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'm gonna put you down, all the way down
Ooh cause you deserve the best and nothing but the best
So I give you the best you've ever had
I'mma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
I'mma put you down

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Put you down, put you down
Put you down, put you down down
Put you down, put you down
Put you down, put you down down
Put you down, put you down
Put you down, put you down down
Put you down, put you down
Put you down, put you down down, I'mma put you down (PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD, PYD)
