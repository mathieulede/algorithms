(a$ap rocky) I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic[al] Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

(chorus)
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

(em3rge)
Forever i will live, there will be no fucks that i give, if that bitch up for auction, it will be a million i will bid, been free-styling to these beats since i was a little kid. back when i was five i had nightmares about not being alive, i used to be dopey and shit man i stuck my hand in a bee hive, i will ride till i die, don't even sigh, all these hating ass niggas saying why, dont even lie, i changed your life, you were the one that put a knife to my throat, then you tried to strangle me with a robe, stop all this shit, your fucking up my career, you can't lie again because rap was my idea

(chorus)
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

(em3rge)
Little snitching bitches it is my life till i die never worry bout my death i know no one would cry, but at least i tried, bitch you cannot steal my pride, me and my niggas create a bomb when we collide, now take a look at the other side, why you looking at me with your beady-eyes, your pissing me off so you better hide

(chorus)
Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE
