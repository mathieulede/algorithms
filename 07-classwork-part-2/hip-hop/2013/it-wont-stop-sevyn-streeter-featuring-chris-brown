[Verse 1: Sevyn Streeter]
I love when you pulling up in your Jeep, bumping all your beats
J's on with your shades on, just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets, but when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing no oh

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Baby hop in my ride, ooh it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down with your doors closed
With my hand up on your thigh
Drive slow ooh, take your time

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way
When you give me that thunder you make my summer rain
Oh-oh-oh oh oh
Oh-oh-oh oh oh
Everyday everyday

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh, yeah
With every single part of me, my love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat
On repeat and it won't stop
Boom, boom, ooh

[Verse 3: Seyvn Streeter]
I love when we pulling up to that beach
Sand down in my feet
Sun down, nobody round, that's one hell of a scene
You rocking my body, rock rock the boat, Aaliyah
Don't it sound familiar?

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
And you sound like, uh uh, aye aye
Looking up into space
It's just me and my bae
And we feel so amazing
Oh, oh, oh, all night, woah)

[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way
When you give me that thunder you make my summer rain
Oh-oh-oh oh oh
Oh-oh-oh oh oh
Everyday everyday

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh
And it won't stop, boom,(boom),boom, ooh
With every single part of me, my love for you is constantly
Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop, boom, boom, ooh

[Bridge: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
Everyday, everyday, I can't wait
You take my breath away from me
Here's my heart, you got the key
Put that on eternity, I love you to infinity
Infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity
My everything, my everything
And when I think about it
Oh it be making me weak baby
I won't ever stop, my heart won't skip a beat baby
And it'll keep going on
Going on, going on

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
And it won't stop, boom-boom, boo-oo-oo-oom (I'm so in love with you, girl)
And it won't stop, (boom-boom, boom-boom) boo-oo-oo-oom, yeah

Forever and ever on repeat, on repeat
And it won't stop, (boom-boom, boom-boom) boo-oo-oo-oom
And it won't stop

[Outro: Chris Brown]

Rock-rocking your body (won't stop)
Rock-rocking your body baby (won't stop)
