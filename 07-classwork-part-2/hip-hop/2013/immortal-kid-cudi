[Sample]
I am the smartest man alive!

[Intro: Kid Cudi]
I tried to tell all my friends when I was a kid that I had powers
And nobody wanted to believe me
All right

[Humming]

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk (hmmm)
I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace in my walk, I sure hope

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal
Tonight I feel immortal
Hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm
Hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Bet you want to see me weak
Not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost Day N' Nite, young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'mma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace in my walk, I sure hope

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal
Tonight I feel immortal
Hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm
Hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal
Tonight I feel immortal
Ohh, tonight I feel immortal
Hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm
Hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm

[Outro]
Dont Fuck with me. Fuck with me. Don't, don't fuck with me. Fuck with me
