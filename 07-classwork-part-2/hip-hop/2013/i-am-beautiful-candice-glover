[Verse 1]
You say I sound silly when I laugh real loud
Talk about my day and you tune me out
You keep telling me lies to make things worse
But I don’t hear you
‘Cause I’m listening to his words

[Chorus]
And he says I am beautiful
And when I fall
It don’t matter that I’m not perfect
I am beautiful
I’m not alone
And in his eyes I’m so worth it
I’m worth every tear
And every scar
And even when you say I’m not
He says I’m beautiful

[Verse 2]
You say I’ll never be good enough
Knock me down
Won’t help me up
And you always say the right thing to make hurt
But I don’t hear you
‘Cause I’m listening to his words

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I deserve better things
He says he understands
I got to do what's right for me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
He says
He says
I’m beautiful
And I’m worth every tear
And every scar
And even when you say I’m not
He says I’m beautiful
