[Verse 1]
Somebody said every day was gon' be sunny skies
Only Marvin Gaye and lingerie
I guess somebody lied
We started discussin', then to fightin', then don't touch me please
Then it's let's stop the madness, just come lay with me
And truth be told, I'm wavin' my flag before it goes bad, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cause we made it this far on for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry to get to the other side
Let's go cause we're gon' survive, oh

[Chorus]
We stay on the front lines
Yeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only in love and war

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you're my general
You quarterback all these plays
Sometimes you're my enemy and I'm throwin' grenades
We'll just be chillin' and laughin', I'm layin' on your chest
I don't know what I did cause things just went left
But here we go back down that road
That's just the way that it goes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause we made it this far on for better or worse
I wanna feel it even if it hurts
If I gotta cry to get to the other side
As long as you're there, I'll survive, oh

[Chorus]
We stay on the front lines
Yeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode
When the smoke clears we dry our tears
Only in love and war

[Bridge]
As long as we make up after every fight when it's over
You know I'm comin' home, right there, where I belong
I'm takin' all this over
Oh-oh-oh-whoa-ooh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
We stay on the front lines
Yeah, but we're still here after the bomb drops
We go so hard we lose control
The fire starts then we explode, baby
When the smoke clears we dry our tears

[Outro]
Only in love and war
Only in love and war
Only in love and war
