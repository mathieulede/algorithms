Men At Large- So Alone

We were together just the other day
Taking life for granted, passing time away
I was there for you, you were there for me
We would be together for eternity
I never knew there'll be sorrow
But I knew we'd be together tomorrow
Together forever we were so wrong
Now, I just can't believe that you're gone

And I'm so alone, alone
You never miss a good thing till it's gone
And I'm so alone, I'm so alone yes I am
I really can't believe that you're gone, gone, gone

Life goes on and it's not the same
Cause I can't help sometimes calling out your name
But, then I realize that you won't come around, no
Oh, what I wouldn't give to see your smile
Oh, yes, we've had our ups and downs
Oh, what I wouldn't do to have you cussing me out
I know it sounds funny, but what can I say
My life just ain't the same since you went away

And I'm so alone, alone
I miss you
You never miss a good thing till it's gone (gone)
And I'm so alone, (ooh) did you have to go away
I really miss you

So Alone, I'm so alone
(Oh, I'm so alone)
(Oh, yes I am)
(I'm so alone)
(So alone)

See, I never knew that there would be sorrow
But I knew we'll be together tomorrow
Together forever we were so wrong
No, I won't believe
I just can't believe
I really don't believe

I'm so alone, (alone), alone
I miss you
You never miss a good thing
(It's gonna be alright)
I'm so alone, alone
(It's gonna be alright)
I miss you
(I know one day)
You never miss a good thing
(We'll see each other again)
I'm so alone, alone
(I miss you mama)
I miss you
(Can't nobody take your place)
You never miss a good thing
(There'll never be another like you)
I'm so alone, alone
I miss you
(You're my one and only mama)
You never miss a good thing
(And I miss you, and I miss you)

I'm so alone
I'm so alone, I'm
(I miss you so much)
I know you're in a better place yes you are
(I'm so lonely without you)
Can my friends help me sing
Here I am
(I miss you)
Can my friends help me sing
Here I am
See when you need a shoulder to cry on
When you need a good friend to rely on
He's gonna be right there
(I miss you so much)
(So lonely with out you)
When you're feeling down and feeling low
(I miss you)
All you gotta do is talk to Lil' Jo
This is Jason, you know I'm your best friend
And I love you, and I love you, and I love you
(I miss you so much, so lonely without you)
(I really miss you)
See everyone's loved and lost
And nobody wants to pay that cost
But if we all stick here together we can make it through all together
(I miss you so much, so lonely without you)
I appreciate having a friend like all of you around
