Come in, close the door, I got something for you
'Cause you're doin' fine, baby
Said you're doin' fine, baby yeah
Alright yes

There's nothin' wrong with foreplay
My body's yours, have it in your way
Take your time, don't rush it, girl
Ooh yeah, do me right and rock my world

Please, touch me here, touch me there
('Cause you're doin' fine, baby)
Kiss me here, kiss me there
(It feel real good, lady)

Touch me here, touch me there
(I want you to kiss me all over)
Kiss me here, kiss me there
(Alright now, baby)

Girl, get lose, let your love come down
Your woman love just turn me around
Kiss me ears, kiss my neck
The heat of the moment, you're at your best

Touch me here, touch me there
Kiss me here, kiss me there
Touch me here, touch me there
Kiss me here, kiss me there

Listen baby
Touch me all over, kiss me all over
Play with my emotions
Make me feel so good, baby

Touch me here, touch me there
Kiss me here, kiss me there
Touch me here, touch me there
Kiss me here, kiss me there

Touch me here, touch me there
Kiss me here, kiss me there
Touch me here, touch me there
Kiss me here, kiss me there
