Your sex is
Got it going on
Your sex is
Got it going on
(Here we go)

Your sex is
Got it going on
(Don't you know)
Your sex is
Got it going on
(I told you so)

[Verse 1:]
I want your body
Tell me you want mine too
There's so many nasty things
I wanna do to you

Lick you up and down
And a running around
But a lovely mind could never
Ever be found

[Hook #1:]
Now you see me and
Baby, now you don't
Come fast upon me, girl
Just give me what I want

Lick you real good
'Til the very last drop
Ah, no
No, no, no, honey
Don't you ever, ever, stop

[Chorus x2:]
Happy days are here again
Looks like this love of ours
Will never ever end

[Verse 2:]
Hold me tight, baby
Don't you let me go
Oh, come on, sugar
You know I love you so

Make you feel like
You never did me wrong
Here's the key, baby
Now open up the door

[Hook #2:]
Now you see me
And baby, now you don't
Come on, honey
Just give me what I want

I love you
Tell you I feel so good inside
You may try to run
But you just can't hide

[Chorus:]
Happy days are here again
I don't think they'll help me, baby
I don't think they'll help me see
Ah, come on

Happy days are here again
Baby, looks like this love of ours
Will never ever end

Happy days are here again
Come on, baby
Come on, sugar
Happy days are here again
Come on, honey

[Bridge:]
Another jam
Happy days
When it's too dull

Looking a
Making a
Taking a time to see
What you women are all about

I still don't get it
Slap it
And grab it
Making life worth it
'Cause a bitch gotta have it

Soon can make you sweat
When you're alone in your home
'Cause her back is pretty strong
And your sex
Got it going on

My man, Will
Can make the groove sweat
Your big G and little G
Hey, I'll give you nothing but happy days

[Chorus:]
Happy days are here again
Come on, honey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

Happy days are here again
Come on, baby
Come on, honey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

Happy days are here again
Why won't you let me
Come on, give it to me, baby
Put it right in
Put it right in for me, baby

Happy days are here again
I'll lick it real good
Yeah
I'll lick it real good
I'll lick it real good
You, you, you, baby

Come on, baby
Come on, honey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
Come on, baby
I want your love
You gonna give it to me, no

Happy days are here again
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, baby

Happy days are here again
Feel real good
It feels real good
Feel real good

[Repeat x3:]
Happy days are here again
