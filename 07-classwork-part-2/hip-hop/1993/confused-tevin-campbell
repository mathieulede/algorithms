[Verse 1:]
Every night I dream of places
I've never been to
So real
It blows my mind

Can somebody tell me where
Could I find these places
And maybe spend some time?

[Hook #1:]
In time
I'll see face after face
True and untrue, yeah

All good things
Come to those who wait for them
I'm still young
But I have plenty of time

[Chorus:]
I'm so confused
About the way I feel
I'm trying with all my mind

And if you ask me why, girl
Please be patient
And I'll be through when it's time

[Verse 2:]
I like the way I feel
And I hope you do, yeah
I'm so curious
I need to know

You said I could talk to you
And you would help me
And tell me things that I should know
Oh, yeah

[Hook #2:]
As time goes on yeah (you know what?)
I'll see the world, baby
Oh, I guess sometimes
I'll have to grow up wondering
I hope I know what to do when it's time

[Repeat Chorus:]
