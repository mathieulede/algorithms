[Verse 1:]
Hello, my love
Before the sun rises
After it goes down

I love you
I love you
I say it over and over again
I love you
Hey, hey, hey

Relax your mind
We can be free together
Take our time
Even through the tears
(Even through the tears)

I'm staying right here
I'm waiting right here
Oh, we're going through some hard times
But it will be alright

[Chorus:]
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright now
Everything's alright
Baby, it will be

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright now
Everything's alright

[Verse 2:]
When teardrops fall
Running down
Running down my face
I need you
Please hear me

Baby, I need you here
Beside me
Everyday I need to know
That you will not leave me

Promise me
Tell me we can work it out
(Tell me we can work it out)

Ooh, baby
Without a doubt
(Ooh, baby, without a doubt)
It will be alright

[Chorus:]
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright now
Everything's alright
Oh, tell me it will be alright

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright now
It's gonna be alright

Baby
Come show me
(It's alright, it's alright)
I need you to hold me
(It's alright, it's alright)
Tell me it's gonna be alright

And I'll believe you
(It's alright, it's alright)
If you tell me
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everything is alright

[Bridge:]
When the grass looks greener
And I think about leaving
I never go too far

No one else can satisfy me
Because I know how good you are
Baby, hey
You make it alright

[Chorus:]
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright now
Everything's alright
Tell me it will be alright

It's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright now
Everything's alright

Baby, take my hand
(It's alright, it's alright)
And make me understand
(It's alright, it's alright)

That everything's gonna be alright
Now
With all that we've been through
(It's alright, it's alright)

Ah, baby
(It's alright, it's alright)
I'll do anything to make it alright
(Everything's alright)

Ooh, baby
(It's alright, it's alright)
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
(It's alright, it's alright)

Show me it's gonna be
It's gonna be alright
Hey, baby
(It's alright, it's alright)

Oooh
(It's alright, it's alright)
(Everything's alright)
It's gonna be
It's gonna be alright

We're going through some hard times
But everything will be fine
I know it will be alright
Baby, I know it
(It's alright, it's alright)

Oh, baby
I know it
(It's alright, it's alright)
I've got the feeling
Everything's alright
(Everything's alright)
