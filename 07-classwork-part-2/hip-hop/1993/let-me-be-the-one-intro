[Intro]

Let me be
Running to, your heart
Want you to come running

[Chorus]

Let me be, let me be
Let me be the one, the one you come running to
Running to (whenever you need it)
Whenever you need it (C'mon baby)

Let me be, let me be
Let me be the one (I wanna be the one)
The one you come running to (Running to)
Whenever you need it (whenever you need it)

[Verse 1]

Lady Love
C'mon listen to me
I know you want to turn away
But all that we've been through
I'll never give up loving you
So won't you give me one more chance for romance
And I'll show you

[Hook]

More love than you've ever known
Straighten it out and make love the way it should be (Oh yes)
One thing we're sure of
The love we have will grow
And if at first you dont succeed, you've got to love again
Just let me be

[Chorus]

Let me be, let me be
Let me be the one, the one you come running to
The one you come running to (whenever you need it)
Whenever you need it

Let me be, let me be
Let me be the one, the one you come running to
The one you come running to (whenever you need it)
Whenever you need it

[Verse 2]

(Ooh) Baby love
If you sacrifice one minute
To hear what I have to say
Still wanna hurt me, then walk away
I'll still be here ever in love with you my dear
And the love I have for you won't disappear (No no)
Let me show you

[Hook]


More love than you've ever known
Straighten it out and make love the way it should be (Oh yes)
One thing we're sure of
The love we have will grow
And if at first you dont succeed, you've got to love again
Let me show you

[Chorus]

Let me be, let me be
Let me be the one (I wanna be)
The one you come running to (the one)
Whenever you need it (yeah)
Whenever you need it

Let me be, let me be
Let me be the one (I wanna be the one)
The one you come running to (The one you come running to)
Whenever you need it (baby) (whenever you need it)

[Verse 3]

Baby all I wanna do is love you
Love has a made a change (in me) (in me) (oh)
Baby all I wanna do is love you (wanna just love you)
Love has made a change (made a change) (in me)
