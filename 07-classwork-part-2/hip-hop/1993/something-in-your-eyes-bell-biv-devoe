[Verse 1:]
You ask me why
I say why not
Anything is possible
Anything can be

Therefore tonight
I'll get you hot
You'll feel a passion you never dreamed

And I know you feel
I'm overconfident
What kind of man could I be?

It's clear to see
It's like animal attraction
When you add it up
It's just a matter of factions, girl

[Chorus:]
Something in your eyes told me
That you were looking for a man you could adore
Something in your eye
Had given me a sign
And I knew it was on
I knew it was on

[Verse 2:]
You think you're dry
I say you're wet
I can make it possible
I can make it true

And all night long
I'll make you sweat
Gonna do a feeling
That's long past overdue

And I know you think
Why so much confidence
What kind of man must I be?

It's clear to see
It's like adding and subtracting
When you add it up
It's just animal attraction

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Verse 3:]
So when I get inside
And make you wet
I'll lick you dry
Create your body weak
From all the body heat

And like a lion
You'll hear me roar
And when I feed it to your body
Make that body
Get weak some more

I'll take you to the peak
I'll make you wanna scream
And like a lion
You'll hear my body
Roar and roar
And roar and roar and roar

[Repeat Chorus x3:]

[Verse 4:]
Anything is possible
And anything can be
You can feel a passion you never dreamed of

See it in your eyes
You've given me a sign
And I knew it was on
I knew it was on

It was something in your eyes
That took me to feel it
Something in your eyes
And hey, I can see it

Something in your eyes
Had given me a sign
And I knew it was on
I knew it was on

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
