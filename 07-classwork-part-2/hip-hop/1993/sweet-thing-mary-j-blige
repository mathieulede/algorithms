[Verse 1]
I will love you anyway even if you cannot stay
I think you are the one for me, here is where you ought to be
I just want to satisfy ya cause you’re not mine and I can’t deny ya
Dontcha hear me talkin’ baby? Love me now or I’ll go crazy

[Chorus] 2x
Whoa, sweet thing
Dontcha know you’re my everything

[Verse 2]
I wish you were my lover but you act so undercover
Love you child my whole life long, be it right or be it wrong
More than what you make me baby
Don’t walk away don’t be so shady
Don't want your mind, don’t want your money
These words I say they may sound funny but

[Chorus] 2x

[Verse 3]
You are my heat, you are my fire
You make me weak with strong desire
Love you child whole night long
Be it right or be it wrong
I just want to satisfy it
Cause if you’re not mine I can’t deny ya
Don’t you hear me talkin’ baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy

[Bridge] 4x
You’re my heat you are my fire
You’re not mine, I can’t deny ya
Don’t you hear me talkin’ baby?
Love me now or I’ll go crazy

[Outro]
C’mon, cause you’re my sweet thing
I don’t care what you do to me
