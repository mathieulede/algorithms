Would you be with me if I had nothing
If I couldn't buy you something
Now you've got your share
And look who's paying

I've worked hard to
Get the things I have, whoo
Oh, I've worked hard to
Get the things you need

And I wanna know
Why you wanna play on me
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play on me
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play
(Why you wanna play your games on me)

Is this just a game
That you're used to playing
Or am I just a fool that's chasing
Girl, I've tried my best to keep you happy
Instead you turned around
And tried to train me

I've worked hard to
Get the things I have, whoo
Oh, I've worked hard to
Get the things you need

And I wanna know
Why you wanna play on me
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play on me
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Baby, baby, baby

Why, why, why you
Play your game

Why you wanna play
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Those silly games, oh
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play, hoo
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Those silly games, baby girl
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Trying to rock my world

Shoo doo (baby)

Say why you wanna play, oh
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play, baby girl
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
I said why you wanna play, oh
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you want to play
(Why you wanna play your games on me)

Why you wanna play
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna play
(Why you wanna play your games on me)

Oh, oh, why you wanna play, baby girl
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
I said you rock my world
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
Why you wanna trip, baby, on me
(Why you wanna play your games on me)

I gave you everything that you wanted, honey
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
(Why you wanna play your games on me)
