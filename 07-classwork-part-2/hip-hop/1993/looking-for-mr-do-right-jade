[Intro:]
It's raining again
What time is it?
Man, I can't believe he done stood me up again
I don't deserve this
What kind of fool does he think I am?

Time after time
And today
But what for?
Huh, you know what?
I think it's time I've looked for Mr. Do Right

[Verse 1:]
Worked all day long
I need a man whose back is real strong
Someone to fulfill my intellect and sexual desires

Now, please
Don't get me wrong
I don't even come on strong
It's been awhile since I've been satisfied
And these feelings I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus:]
I used to be in love
But it was oh, so long ago
My mind and body's craving
For a real man to give me some love

But now that you're here with me
There's a smile upon my face
Cause loving you is so damn easy
And you sure 'nuff driving me crazy

[Chorus:]
Can't someone stop this rain from falling on my face?
I'm looking for Mister
Mr. Do Right
Someone who can do it all night

When will you learn playing with fire really burns
I'm searching for Mister
Mr. Do Right
Someone who can please me through the night

[Verse 2:]
I sit here waiting
You just won't call, no
My mind is so confused
But you don't seem to care at all

Now Lord knows I've tried
To keep our love alive
So I sing this song for you
Cause it seems like the right thing to do

[Repeat Pre-Chorus:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
You used to love me
(I need a real man)
I need a strong man
I need a Mr. Do Right

You don't hold me like you used to
My mind and body's craving
Oh yeah
For Mr. Do Right
Lord knows I've tried
Mr. Do Right

Don't keep me waiting, anticipating, oh
I worked all week long
I need a Mister
I need a man who's back is real strong
Fulfill me
Take care of my sexual desires, baby
