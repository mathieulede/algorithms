[Intro: S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M.]
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day

[Verse 1: Michelle Visage]
Here it is, another day, so dark and gloomy
My situation's real sadness goin' through me
Because my love is not here for my kiss
All I have is thoughts of yesterdays bliss
Images of you stay on my mind
Anticipating and waiting for the clock to unwind
Anxiety plays me as dusk turns to dawn
But I could take the wait, it won't be long
As confidence grows, I start to ready myself
Prepare myself for what lies ahead
As I dread the every minute I have to face without you here
Close but so far as the time draws near
How much more can I take, how much more, what can I do?
Just hold on tight and be strong
I know I'll make it through
Nows the time for the needs to finally go away
I feel you near, and it's a lovely day

[Chorus: S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M.]
Then I look at you
And the worlds all right with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

[Verse 2: Michelle Visage]
That was then and this is now
My pulse rate beats fast and at last you're around
I greet you
My eyes cannot leave you
I just wanna squeeze you
As I bestow a gentle hello
I couldn't front and play hard to get
Because the boy was wrong
And I felt strong
Ever since we met
When you appear
The tensions go
Mentally calm
Becomes the body the mind and the soul
Lets cut to the chase
Before the time will waste away
So we can enjoy
The walks conversational play
Take a cruise to nowhere
Is anyone out there
Who cares
As long as you're here with me
The best is yet to come
Together well be as one
Our love has just begun
Guaranteed my love
I'll never go away
As long as you're around
It's a lovely day

[Chorus: S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M.]
Then I look at you
And the worlds all right with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)

[Verse 3: Michelle Visage]
I wish they could last forever
The rendezvous of coming together
Meeting in places of pleasure
Times we spent were so real
And I could feel - the everlasting love coming through to my appeal
But now the time has come to mind
That we must part and separate to
Make a start with that thought in mind
There's only one thing to say
With you in my life
It'll be a lovely day!

[Chorus: S.O.U.L. S.Y.S.T.E.M.]
Then I look at you
And the worlds all right with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be, it's gonna be, it's gonna be
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
A lovely day
(Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day
Lovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day)
