1st Verse

There was a time when I stayed at home alone
I knew a lot of guys, but none I could call my own
But when you came along, my heart sang a brand new song
Now I'm happy, glad I found you and I'm not afraid to say

1/2 Chorus

Welcome to my love
Come on in and make yourself at home
Welcome to my life
I know everything's gonna be alright

2nd Verse

Needed a woman, said you'd need a girl that's just like me
You've had a lot of girlfriends, but none in whom you can believe
Time just dragged along, you're tired a playin' the same ole song
But now you're happy, glad I found you
'Cause you're not afraid to sayâ€¦

Chorus

Welcome to my love
Come on in and make yourself at home
Welcome to my life
I know everything is gonna be alright
Welcome to my love
Come on in, take all you want
Welcome to my life
I know everything's gonna be alright

Bridge

You are the only one for me
Here is right where I wanna be
We're like two leaves on a vine
You know just what is on my mind
I just wish you could'a been here in my life
The whole time!

Repeat Chorus
