Every time I'm with you, baby
I just can't give enough myself, no, no
'Cause you know how to treat me, baby
Boy, you love me like nobody else

I never have to ask, he knows exactly what I need
He always finds away to bring out all the love in me
Forever we'll be strong as long as we hang on to love
We'll be satisfied

All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right
All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right

It took so long to find someone, baby
That wasn't afraid of the strength of a real woman, no
I'm never broken hearted
'Cause my man, my man, keeps it comin', yes, he does

I never have to ask, he knows exactly what I need
He always finds away to bring out all the love in me
Forever we'll be strong as long as we hang on to love, ooh
We'll be satisfied

All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right
All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right

All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right
All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right

All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right
All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right

You know exactly how to please
Bring me fallin' to my knees all day
I wanna love you through the night
Make it good, make it right all day, oh, all day

All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right
All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right

All day, all night
Feel so good

You know exactly how to please
You see you brought me to my knees all day
I wanna love you, make it right
Love you all through the night all day

All night
Feel so good, feel so right
All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right

All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right
All day, all night
Feel so good, feel so right
