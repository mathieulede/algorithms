[Verse 1]
Look at that girl
Standing over there
I wanna get with her
But all I do is stare

She is so fine
I wanna make that girl mine
I can't control The way I feel inside

[Chorus]
I want a honey dip
The girls are so fine
And I'm looking for a honey dip
Got more than one girl on my mind

I want a honey dip
I'm losing my mind
And I'm looking for a honey dip
Can't have more than one at a time

[Verse 2]
Now look at that girl
As sexy as can be
I wanna love her down
Because of my personality

Legs are shapely
Drives me crazy
There's just one thing
That never ceases to amaze me

[Chorus]
I want a honey dip
The girls are so fine
And I'm looking for a honey dip
Got more than one girl on my mind

I want a honey dip
I'm losing my mind
And I'm looking for a honey dip
Can't have more than one at a time

[Rap: Bret Bouldin]
Love
Let me dip into your honey
Seems that you stun me
Your body is so good and plenty

Looking at your lips
I wish that I could hold those hips
In an event of ecstasy
She come to get next to me

Girl, share my passion
Evening with you
Is all that I'm asking

Don't make me flip or trip
Come here, my cutie pie
And be my honey dip

[Chorus]
I want a honey dip
The girls are so fine
And I'm looking for a honey dip
Got more than one girl on my mind

I want a honey dip
I'm losing my mind
And I'm looking for a honey dip
Can't have more than one at a time
