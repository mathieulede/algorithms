[Verse 1/ Coko]
Boy there you go
You're tellin me that you love me
But boy you know
That you belong to another girl who loves you

[Pre-Hook Coko,Taj & Lee Lee!]
You are!
So fine, so fine, so fine!
(so fine)
Blow my mind!
(You blow my mind)
Things you do!
With the things you do to me
She sees!
She's not blind
She's not blind
(She's not blind)
Things you do! things you do for for me
(Things you do for me, but I know!)

[Hook]
I'm so into you
I don't know what I'm gonna do (dont know what to do)
Boy you got me so confused (I'm so confused)
I don't know what I'm gonna do

[Verse 2/Coko]
Friends ask how could
I give myself to one who belongs to someone else
They just don't know
Your love's so good
That they would want for themselves

[Pre-Hook/Hook]

You're not, you're not mine
You're not, you're not mine
You're not, you're not mine

You're not
Ooh, what am I supposed to do

[Hook & Coko ad libs until the song ends]
