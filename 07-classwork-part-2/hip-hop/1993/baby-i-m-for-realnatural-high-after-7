Baby baby you dont understand
How much I love you baby
How much I wanna be your only man
And baby baby baby you don't have to go
Stay a little while longer, I wanna talk to you just a little more

I see the little tears in your eyes, about to fall
You are wondering, if I'm for real

But if you cry, I wonder why you cry
I tell you no lie, this how I feel

Oh, baby I'm for real (hook)
Do do do do do do
Do do doooh

Baby baby baby you don't have to go
Stay a little while longer baby
Hold me baby, love me baby, yeah yeah
This is how I feel

Baby I'm for real
Baby I'm for real

But if you wanna know the truth about it
Girl I just can't live without it and that's why I'm professing my love to you
So I can live my lif with you
Do do do do do
Do do dod do do

Baby I'm for real
Baby wipe the tears from your eyes
Now you won't have to cry no more
Baby I'm for real
Darlin hey yea baby

Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you more till the day I die
Take to the sky on a natural high
Loving you kissing you telling you why
