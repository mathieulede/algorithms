One song to tell you
And one song to smell you
One song to touch you and tell you how much
(I feel!!!)
Twisted all up, I'm dying inside
Believe it
(Baby!!!)
You know I never lie
Straight from my heart
Sweet song of love, of love
Can you remember
The time that my member
-ship card for the Union
Was long overdue?
(No!!!)
I don't believe you remember my name
I was a fool then
But must I go through all this pain?
(Yes!!!)
Straight from my heart
Sweet song of love, of love
Straight from my heart
Sweet song of love, ooh oooh...
Straight from my heart
Sweet song of love
