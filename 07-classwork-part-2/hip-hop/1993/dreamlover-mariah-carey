[Intro]
Baby, baby
Baby, oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I need a lover to give me
The kind of love that will last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, babe, oh, yeah
I want a lover who knows me
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights 'till the dawn
Why don't you take me away?

[Chorus]
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to baby now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I want to share forever with you, baby, with you, baby

[Verse 2]
I don't want another pretender, no
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind
No, no, no, no, no, baby
I need someone to hold on to
The kind of love that won't fly away
I just want someone to belong to
Everyday of my life, always
So come and take me away

[Chorus]
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to baby now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I want to share forever with you

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Baby, come and take me away
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down (take me down)
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please (won't you please) come around?
'Cause I want to share forever with you, baby
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down (take me down)
Take me anywhere you want to baby now
I need you so desperately (Come on, baby)
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I want to share forever with you, baby
