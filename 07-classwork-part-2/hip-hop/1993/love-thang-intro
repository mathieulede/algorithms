[Verse 1:]
Honey don't you know that I been waiting, everyday anticipating
For a woman just like you to come my

To end this loneliness I found
And it's good to have you around

I got to let you known that I'll never let you go
And you make me feel, so special
You're mine and mine alone
We got a love thang goin on

No valley low for me to
Keep you completely love you down so sweetly
Nothing but a love thang goin on
