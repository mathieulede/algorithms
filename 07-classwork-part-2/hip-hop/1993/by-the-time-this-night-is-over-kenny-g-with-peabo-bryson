Silence takes over
Saying all we need to say
There's endless possibilities
In the moves we can make
Your kiss is giving every indication
If this heart of mine is right

By the times this night is over
The stars are gonna shine on two lovers in love
And when the morning comes
It's gonna find us together
In a love that's just begun

By the time this night is over
Two heart are gonna fly to the heaven above
And we'll get closer and closer and closer
By the time this night is over

Lets take it slow and ease it back
Just lay back and love take us over
There's magic here with you and I
And it's gonna take us all the way
Lets find some kind of deeper comversation
And darling if it's right

By the time this night is over
The stars are gonna shine on two loves in love
And when the morning comes
It's gonna find us together
In a love that just begun
By the time this night is over
