I've gotta go, and it's not because I don't love you
Or anything like that
But the reason is just plain and simple
You see, girl, I'm not in love with you
I never had it and I guess I never will
Because you see, I can't get over my first love

You've been so kind to treat me so fine
And I know, for me, you'll do anything
But I've made up my mind, I'm just wasting your time
'Cause I'm yet to get over my first love

You'll meet someone that will pay
Attention to you everyday
And I might as well be true to myself
'Cause I'll never get used to no one else

You've been so kind to treat me so fine
And I know, for me, you'll do anything
But I've made up my mind, I'm just wasting your time
'Cause I'm yet to get over my first love

I thought that she was my best friend
I don't know where we went wrong
Will I ever feel love again
Or will I always be singing this same song?

You've been so kind to treat me so fine
And I know, I know for me, you'll do anything
But I've made up my mind, I'm just wasting your time
'Cause I'm yet to get over my first love

I can't get over my first love
Well, well, well, well, well, well
Ooh, I can't get over you, baby
No, no, no, no, no, oh yeah

Oh, come back, you've been so kind to treat me so fine
And I know, I know, for me, you'll do anything
But I've made up my mind, I'm just wasting your time
'Cause I'm yet to get over my first love, oh

Get away from that door
I've gotta walk on through that door
I'm gonna miss my baby
Oh baby, I've made up my mind
'Cause I, I can't take this no more, baby
To get over my first love

Oh, you, you've really been so kind
You shouldn't have been so fine, baby
I should have never ever been here with you this long
'Cause you know I, I can't forget my baby
No, no, no, I can't forget my baby
