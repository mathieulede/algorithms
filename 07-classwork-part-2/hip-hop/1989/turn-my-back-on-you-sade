[Chorus:]
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?
To turn my back on you
Now would I turn my back on me?

[Verse 1:]
No
(Don't say)
I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know
I'll never let you down
(Ah, ha)

No way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down no way

Try to tell you that it's all right
Oooh
I'm not playing
Can't you see what I'm saying?
You are my religion

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
No
(Don't say)
I'm not gonna turn my back on you
You know
I'll never let you down
(Ah, ha)

No way
I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down no way

Try to tell you that it's all right
Oooh
I'm not playing
Can't you see what I'm saying?
You are my religion

[Repeat Chorus:]
