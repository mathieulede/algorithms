[Verse 1]
I go to work like a doctor
When I rock the mic, you got to like
The way I operate
I make miracles happen just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent and I'm flowin'
And explodin'
On the scene mean
I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that are so essential
To make a rhyme send chills
Then you know I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill
As I build a guild for all the rappers with skill
And kill the weak rappers with no thrills
Hang 'em in effigy
If he's a sucker, hang 'em to the left of me
Cause my right hand man is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own and my game plan
Is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no reason to rush, it ain't no race
I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
Cause I know when to go 'head into
The classic Moe Dee rap That sent ya
Runnin' around, holdin' ya head
Asking your homeboy "Yo man, you hear what he said?"
Another funky rhythm
Look at your man and give him a high five
Cause I'm live
Runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it
I go to work

[Hook]
I go to work
I go to work

[Verse 2]
I go to work like an architect
I build a rhyme sometimes it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter, it becomes visibly better
Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vacation, I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone, Daddy's home
Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the suckers in the place who run their face
A taste of the bass and who's the ace
Start the race, I'm coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I have ya, I have to slap ya
Senseless with  endless rhymes don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done
Your mind will become
So trapped in the rap you'll lust another one
But you gotta wait; it takes time
I don't write, I build a rhyme
Draw the plans, draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work

[Hook]
I go to work
I go to work

[Verse 3]
I go to work, like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to outfox ya
Like a punch my rhyme rocks ya
Some times it knocks ya  so hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks, so power packed
Before you can react, you're flat on your back
Down for the count, get up and dismount
'Cause I'm coming with an endless amount
Of rhymes in a hurry like a flurry
A collage to camouflage the power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote, I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight I wrote
Rhymes at a level, so you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent, so stay awake
Sleepwalkers, slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil
Writing my rhymes in its highest form
I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up
A few casualties but so what
If you're slow, you blow
You know you go, I flow
I throw all pro, I go to work

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
To say rap is not work is ludicrous
Whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me, you'll compare me
To a prophet for profit, not merely
Putting words together for recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation?
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work

[Hook]
