I need you
I need You
Don't, Don't, Don't
Don't Make me
Don't, Don't, Don't
Don't Make me
Don't, Don't, Don't
Don't Make me
Don't, Don't, Don't
Don't Make me

Don't make me over
Now that you know how I adore you

Don't make me over
Now that I'd do anything for you
Don't make me over
Now that you know how I adore you

Don't pick on the things I say, the things I do
Just love me with all my faults, the way I love you
I'm begging you

Don't make me over
Now that I can't make it without you
(I need you so)
Don't make me over
(Can't you do me)
I wouldn't change one thing about you

Just take me inside your arms, and hold me tight
I'll always be by your side, when if you wrong or right
I'm begging you

Don't make me over
(Don't make me over)
Now that I'd do anything for you
(I love so)
Don't make me over
Don't change, don't change
Don't change
Now that you know how I adore you
Don't make me over
Don't make me over
Now that you've got me at your command

Accept me for what I am
Accept me for the things that I do
Accept me for what I am
Accept me for the things that I do

Don't make me over
