[Verse 1]
[Johnny Gill]
On a perfect day, I know that I can count on you
When that's not possible
Tell me can you weather the storm?
[Ralph Tresvant]
'Cause I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times
She will always, always be right there

[Chorus]
Sunny days, everybody loves them
Tell me baby can you stand the rain?
Storms will come
This we know for sure (This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain?

[Verse 2]
[Johnny]
Love unconditional, I'm not asking just of you
And girl to make it last
I'll do whatever needs to be done
[Ralph]
But I need somebody who will stand by me
When it's tough she won't run
She will always, be right there for me

[Chorus]
Sunny days, everybody loves them, tell me, baby
Can you stand the rain? (Can you stand it?)
Storms will come
(Ricky Bell: I know, I know all the days won't be perfect)
This we know for sure
(Ricky: But tell me can you stand it)
Can you stand the rain?
(Ricky: Can you stand the rain?)

Can you stand the rain
(Ralph: Can you stand the rain?)
Can you stand the rain
(Ricky: No pressure, no pressure from me, baby)
This we know for sure
Can you stand the rain
(Ricky: 'Cause I want you, and I need you, and I love you, girl)
(Ralph: Tell me, baby)
Can you stand the rain
(Ralph: Will you be there for me?)

(Mike Bivins: Come on, baby, lets go get wet)

Can you stand the rain
(Ralph: Can you stand the rain?)
Can you stand the rain
(Ralph: Will you be there, girl?)
Can you stand the rain
(Ralph: Storms will come for sure)
Can you stand the rain
(Ralph: Can you stand the rain?)
Can you stand the rain
(Johnny: This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
(Johnny: This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain
(Johnny: This we know for sure)
Can you stand the rain
Can you stand the rain

[Johnny]
Yeah, it's gonnaâ€”but I know, I know I'll be right there
(Can you stand the rain)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
