She got it going, got it going on, going on
She got it going, got it, get, get, going on
She got it going, got it going on, going on
She got it going, got it, get, get...

[Verse 1: Ronnie DeVoe]
In store signing autographs at the mall
Next in line was a fly girl standing tall
Signed my name and said 'Give me a call, baby, ya know?'
(In-store)
The girl screamed and fainted panic on the floor
The bodyguard pulled us out the back door
I never saw her anymore
It was an in-store heartbreak

[Verse 2: Ralph Tresvant]
Live at five interview for Channel 2
Saw a cutie, thought she was on the TV crew
She said after the show (I'll be waiting for you) Cool
After the show she got in the car and what a scene
Her dad was the driver of the limousine
I didn't know she was only thirteen
It was a young girl heartbreak

[Bridge 1: Ralph]
People think we don't get lonely
But we're far away from home
One minute 20,000 people
But then they go home, we're alone
It's off to another city
Where everybody knows my name
But when I meet that perfect honey
Is it me she wants or is it my fame?

Girlies and groupies and parties all night
Is the life that can lead you, lead you to a N.E. heartbreak
From city to city, our friends and our fans
They're the ones who can keep us from having
N.E. heartbreak

[Verse 3: Ricky Bell]
Center stage N.E. was groovin'
The beat was hard and the girlies were movin'
There she was third row center coolin'
She was cold
Last note of the last song
House lights up they came on
When I looked she was gone
It was a third row heartbreak

[Bridge 2: Ralph]
People think our life is easy
And they think we've got it made
But we're living under pressure
Just to be on top
And to give it the best that we can give you
And to never let you down
We'll keep strivin' for perfection
N.E. heartbreak is coming to your town

Girlies and groupies (Believe that! On the strength, boy)
(Yo, peep this!)
She got it going, got it going on, going on
She got it going, got it, get, get, going on
She got it going, got it going on, going on
(N.E. heartbreak) She was cold

She got it going, got it going on, going on
She got it going, got it, get, get, going on
She got it going, got it going on, going on
(N.E. heartbreak) Ya know?

(Break)

[Bridge 3: Johnny Gill]
You better beware
Oh, everybody, everybody, everybody sing it for me, yeah

[Outro: New Edition & (Johnny)]
Beware of N.E. heartbreak (heartbreak)
Spreading fast and there's no cure (and there's no cure)
No need to run from heartache (It's gonna get ya)
It's gonna get you, get you for sure
(Everybody, everybody sing it, yeah)

Beware of N.E. heartbreak
(Everybody, everybody sing it, yeah)
Spreading fast and there's no cure
(And sing it just a little bit louder)
No need to run from heartache
It's gonna get you, get you for sure
(Everybody clap your hands)

Beware of N.E. heartbreak
(Everybody clap your hands)
Spreading fast and there's no cure
(Clap your hands and sing it a little louder)
No need to run from heartache
It's gonna get you, get you for sure
(Everybody sing it a little bit louder)

Beware of N.E. heartbreak
(Everybody sing it a little bit louder)
Spreading fast and there's no cure
No need to run from heartache
It's gonna get you, get you for sure
(Beware)

Beware of N.E. heartbreak
(I want everybody in the house to stand up and sing beware)
Spreading fast and there's no cure
No need to run from heartache
It's gonna get you, get you for sure

(Yo, Mike, my man, what about your story?)

[Mike Bivins]
My story? Boy--yo, Rizz (laughs)
*beatbox*
Called up my girl and said 'Meet me on the tour'
I got a suite cold chillin' on the 50th floor
And I'll leave your ticket at the door
And baby, don't forget the pumps
She lost her backstage pass and the room key
Then got stopped by hotel security
And I spent the whole night lonely
And it was a hotel heartbreak
