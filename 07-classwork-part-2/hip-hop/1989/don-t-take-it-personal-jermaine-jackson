It's just one of them days, when I wanna be all alone
It's just one of them days, when I gotta be all alone
It's just one of them days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong

I wanna take some time out to think things through
I know it always feels like I'm doing you wrong
But I'm so in love with you
So understand that I'm only in love
You're the only one I need
So have no thought that I want to leave
And baby trust me please

Just one of them days, that a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't want to take it out on you
Just one of them days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal, baby baby baby baby
Don't take it personal

I see and I think about every thing we do
And I find myself in mysery and that ain't cool
Hey now, I really want to be with you
The whole way through
But the way you make me feel inside keeps me confused
As I swing back from mood to mood
It's not because of you
I never want you to be insecure
So won't you understand that I'm only in love
You're the only one I need
I'll be there for you when you need me boy
So baby don't you leave

Just one of them days, that a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't want to take it out on you
Just one of them days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal, baby baby baby baby
Don't take it personal

Just one of them days, that a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't want to take it out on you
Just one of them days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal, baby baby baby baby
Don't take it personal

Don't take it personal, baby baby baby baby
Don't take it personal
Don't take it personal, yeah , don't take it personal

Just one of them days, that a girl goes through
When I'm angry inside
Don't want to take it out on you
Just one of them days, don't take it personal
I just wanna be all alone
And you think I treat you wrong
Don't take it personal, baby baby baby baby
Don't take it personal
