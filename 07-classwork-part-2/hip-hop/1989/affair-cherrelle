[Verse 1:]
What do you call this thing we have
Am I your woman
Are you my man?

Could it be love or just a fling?
Maybe your body
It agrees with me

[Chorus:]
Affair
I don't need commitment
I don't need a man to tell me how to feel

Affair
I don't want a promise
All I really need is to be close to you

[Verse 2:]
I want respect and I'll state my case
'Cause, baby
I won't take all your loveliness in my face

So hear me loud and clear
Don't matter if you flirt
As long as you're discreet
And make sure nobody's hurt like me

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Bridge:]
Affair

I don't need, I don't need, no
I don't need
I don't need
I don't need, no
I don't need, I don't need

Affair, affair, affair

I don't need commitment
I don't need a man to tell me how to feel
I don't want a promise
All I really need is to be close to you

Affair
Ooh, ooh, affair
