Why do I keep on caring
When you don't want to be there for me?
Your life goes on but mine stood still
I couldn't breath despair

Now you ask me for my friendship
To forget our past commitment
To happily watch you from the side
But I will not live this life

I'm still missing your love
I wanna be with you tonight
I'm still missing your love
I'm still missing you

Go back to our favourite places
Where our love became so famous
To remind myself how much I stained
Those with pride I gave

The truth often make me feel better
We stand that we've never been together at all
'Cause after you tasted honey so sweet

There's nothing else that can compete

Sometimes I think I'll lose my mind
But I know all things will heal the time
Slow if the win that fool myself
But I gonna crown it back

I'm still (Miss)
(Miss)
(Miss)
(Missing your)

(Miss)
(Miss)
(Missing)

(Sometimes I think I'll lose my mind)
But I know all things will heal the time
(Easy to say) I'm doing well
But it's so hard to get there

I'm still missing your love
I wanna be with you tonight
I'm still missing your love
I'm still missing you

I'm still missing your love
I wanna be with you tonight
I'm still missing your love
I'm still missing you

I'm still missing your love
I wanna be with you tonight
I'm still missing your love
I'm still missing you

I'm still missing your love
