[Verse 1:]
Back in the days of used to be
The child in me
My love
So like the flower by the apple tree
You and me
My love

[Chorus:]
Only you
Can change my lonely nights
Only you can shine
The brightest light
Within my soul, my soul

[Verse 2:]
Sun filled the clouds
All around you then
All around you in
My love

No need to follow
What has gone away
I am here to stay
My love

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Back in the days of used to be
The child in me
My love

No need to follow what has gone away
I am here to stay
My love
My love...

My love...
My love
My love...
