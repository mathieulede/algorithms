[Verse 1]
Silver moon
Shining on my bed
Beside my pillow
Light the pathway
To bring that man
To me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, ooh
Something tells me
My words are going straight to his heart
And ooh, something tells me
You will be all mine

[Chorus]
Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinking of you, oh
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you
You got it going on
You're turning me on
Baby, come to me

[Verse 2]
Know a secret
How to make you want me
How to make you love me
Whoa, oh...
'Cause the moon above
It's a friend of mine
And she'll make you burn

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Said, ooh, ooh
Something tells me
The fire's going right up your spine
Whoa, ooh, something tells me
You will be all mine

[Chorus]
Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinking of you, oh
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you, yeah
You got it going on
You're turning me on
Baby, come to me
Whoa, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Come on, baby
You know what I want
That's it
Come a little closer, baby
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Oh, oh, oh
Something's telling me, yeah
Fire's going right up your spine
And ooh, ooh, something's tells me, yeah
You will be all mine

[Chorus]
Baby, come to me
'Cause I love you
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, yeah
Baby, come to me
Gotta have you
You got it going on
You're turning me on

Baby, come to me
Sweet baby, I love you (Sweet baby)
Ooh, baby, I need you (Said I need you)
Sweet baby, come to me now
(Come on home to me, baby)

Baby, come to me
Sweet baby, I love you
(There's a silver moon)
Oh, baby, I need you
(Shining over you)
Sweet baby
Come to me now
(Me and you, oh)

Baby, come to me
Sweet baby, I love you (Oh)
Oh, baby, I need you
Sweet baby, come to me now
(Baby, why don't you come on home to me)

Baby, come to me
Sweet baby, I love you
(You got it going on)
Oh, baby, I need you
(Oh, oh, oh)
Sweet baby, come to me now
(Baby, please, come on home to me)

Baby, come to me (Oh)
Sweet baby, I love you
Oh, baby, I need you
Sweet baby, come to me now
(Oh, baby, come to me)

Baby, come to me
