(I like) Girl words can't express the way I feel for you
(I like) The way you hold me, the way you touch me
(I like) Girl everything you do to me, you know I like it
(I like) Don't stop now

[Hook]
(I like) Oh, yeah
(I like) Oh oh oh (I like the way)
(I like) Oh, yeah
(I like) Oh oh oh (I like the way)

[Verse 1]
My dreams are now reality
Each and every time you are here with me
Your touch, you give me with your hand
When you caress my skin, I'm under your command
Girl, you hypnotize me with your eyes
It took me some time, but now I realize
It's you to whom which I belong
I love it, the feeling's getting strong

[Hook 2]
(I like) The things you do to me
(I like) It brings up ecstasy
(I like) It really turns me on (I like the way)
(I like) The feeling's getting strong

[Verse 2]
Oh girl, you are my lover
When I'm with you, there is no other
A spell you got me under
Please don't you leave, I'm on my hands and knees
Words can't express the way I feel
Emotions for you are so real
Girl, you love me over and over again
Don't stop, please don't let it end

[Hook 2]

Hey girl, you know I care (I like the way, oh)
Sugar, you know I love it, baby
Oh oh oh oh
