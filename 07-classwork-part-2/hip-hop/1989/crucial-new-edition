[Verse 1: Ralph Tresvant]
Heart, beating strong
I was serious
My love was furious for you
Only you, oh baby
Darling I don't know why
I can't leave you alone
You thrill me to the bone
You're the one
Obsession
Ah, baby

[Chorus]
Don't you know it was a crucial lovin'
Cru-cial
Crucial lovin'
Cru-cial

[Verse 2]
Chills, over me
Different from the rest
I won't settle for less
Hello
Won't take no
Ah, baby
From now on you and I
Stood the test of time
Yet still you're on my mind
Always, night and day
Ah, baby

[Chorus: New Edition & (Ralph ad-libs)]
Don't you know it was a crucial lovin'
(I never knew love could be so crucial)
Cru-cial (Oh, yeah)
Crucial lovin' (Girl, you are my last time, sugar)
Cru-cial (Baby, you're the one)

Don't you know it was crucial lovin' (From now on, baby!)
Cru-cial (Don't you know it was crucial love)
Crucial lovin (Down to the, down to the bone)
Cru-cial (Heh, heh, hey!)

[Bridge: Ralph]
I have more than told you
Girl, I've got to show you
Feelings over load extreme
For the very first time
Girl, you are my last time
You have taken over me

[Chorus: New Edition & (Ralph ad-libs)]
Don't you know it was crucial lovin'
(Baby, I don't know why, oh)
Cru-cial (And you're on my mind every day)
Crucial loving (I never knew love could be so crucial)
Cru-cial (Oh, girl. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't you know it was crucial lovin'
(It shouldn't hurt me this way)
Cru-cial (You're the one! You're the one!)
Crucial lovin' (You're the one, you're the one for me)
Cru-cial (No one else)

Don't you know it was crucial lovin'
(Girl, this is my last chance)
Cru-cial (So I'm begging you)
Crucial lovin' (It's crucial; it's crucial!)
Cru-cial (Yeah)

Don't you know it was crucial lovin'
(Down to the, down to the, down to the bone!)
Cru-cial (Down to the, down to the bone)
