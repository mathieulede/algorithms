I like the way
That you give me all your love each day
I like the way
That you tell me everything's okay
And then the time comes for us
To show how much we care
You bring me joy
With the things we do

You're taking me to heaven
24\7
You're mine
You've got me going in circles

Deep in my heart, girl
I know you feel just the same
Deep in the night
I feel it when you call my name
Don't ever worry
Cause I never let you down
You bring me joy
With the things you do

Oh, I want your love
I don't want nobody else
24 hours
7 days a week
Your love is mine

Monday through Friday
Saturday and Sunday
Round and round the clock two times
Oh, your love is mine
Oh, mine
