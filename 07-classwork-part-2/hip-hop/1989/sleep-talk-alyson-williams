Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep
Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep

You don't know but you got your tongue on your soul, baby
I always thought, but now I know
You're just a lowdown so-and-so, hey, hey
He's sayin':

"Oh, how I love you, place the one above you
Wish you could be all mine, yeah"
But instead of tellin' lies
It's the truth that makes me cry
As you talk in your sleep, ohoho

You say you will love only me
And I will love only you
And now you come running back to me
Call the stair, disrespect
Little baby, you can't be trusted, yeah

Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep
You been telling on yourself, baby

Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep
I didn't hear from no-one else

Early in the next morning
He was-a stretchin' and a-yawnin'
Woke up with a big smile

He had sparkles in his eyes
That I never took the time
To notice before

Mmm, hey, hey baby, what's happening?
Good morning, how you're doing, sugar?
I've been chanted myself
You know, I'm gonna get some weed
Baby, what's wrong?
You look kinda pinky, did you sleep well?
Did you sleep alright?
Kiss on the eye?

Ah!

You say you will love only me
And I will love only you (Ohoho)
And now you come running back to me
Call the stair, disrespect
Little baby, you can't be trusted, yeah

Sleep talk, yeah
You been talking in your sleep
You been talking in your sleep, you can't keep a secret
Sleep talk (Hey, hey)
You been talking in your sleep
I didn't hear from no-one else but you

Sleep talk, yeah
You been talking in your sleep
If you keep on plea-talking, pretty soul, you gonna be street-walking
Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep
Ooohooohooohooo, yeah

Ohohoho (Ohohoho)
Ooohooohooo

Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep

Sleep talk (Hey, hey, yeah)
You been talking in your sleep (Sweet talking, yeah)

Sleep talk (Don't you know by now)
You been talking in your sleep (No, no, no....)

Sleep talk (Hey, hey)
You been talking in your sleep (Telling a lie, dirty lie)
Sleep talk, sleep talk, sleep talk, yeah, yeah

Sleep talk, yeah, yeah

Sleep talk (Ooohooohooo)
You been talking in your sleep (Telling lies, you make me cry, oh, you wanna)
Sleep talk
You been talking in your sleep (Oh, ooohooo)

Sleep talk (Baby)
You been talking in your sleep
What makes you think that I don't know what you do?
Sleep talk
