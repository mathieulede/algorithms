GODFATHER, GODFATHER, GODFATHER, GODFATHER
Kick the beat
TELL ME WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN YOU WAS A LITTLE BOY?
Well son, I’ll tell ya, back in my day (cough cough)
We had a lot more tradition, you kids these days with your disco’s and your boom boom
Boom, that’s all I hear
In the old country we had a lot more heart
More spirit, more soul
(soul, soul soul, whispered in the back ground)
(MC LYTE)
And if anyone can give you soul MC Lyte can
You got no soul that’s a rough wanna um
Kick the beat that’s a movin’
Clap your hands to the funky stuff
HELP ME GET MY SOUL, HELP ME GET MY SOUL
Kick the beat that’s movin’
Kick the beat that’s movin’
(MALE VOX)
I remember not too long ago, when music played it had soul
People movin to a soulfull groove, most the day was normal yeah
Since that music’s changed and it’s lost that thing that keeps you feelin’ so good
Mc lyte I come to you for sympathy
For the word, help us please
HELP ME GET MY SOUL, HELP ME GET MY SOUL
Can you help us please need your help indeed help us that soul
Can you help us please need your help indeed help us that soul

You got no soul that’s a rough wanna oom
Let me see what I can do to heal the sickness
No problem I got the cure for quickness
Since I began I’ve been into man and if anyone can give you soul MC Lyte can
A slow potion past a generation fought over by mighty insulation
A switch is expected and once the soul is injected
Your life is affected
You walk and talkin’ and how you say your cured
Addict stye with that step cold file
You listen up to get down
Now clap your hands to the funk stuff
HELP ME GET MY SOUL HELP ME GET MY SOUL
