Since you've been mine
Got you going my way
Seems I can do no wrong
It's the way that I feel when I'm with you
Your love makes me feel so strong

With you in my life
It makes the world seen right
And one little kiss can make a dark day bright
Don't know what you do
To make me feel so well
You must be an angel with a magic spell

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
She's my lucky charm

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm

Out on the street
Friends are saying
They see what a change you've made in me
And they wonder why
There's a smile on my face
They're gonna be in love one day
They'll see

With you lifting me
I'm walking on air
And when you hold my hand
I don't ever care
Don't need a four leaf clover
Or a lucky penny
I only need to know you'll be there for me

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
She's my lucky charm

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm

Well, my girl's the best
She gives me luck
When I'm feeling down
She cheers me up
When I see her
My feelings rise

Ooh, girl
You hypnotize
Twinkle, twinkle little star
Lucky is what you are

With long dark hair
And big brown eyes
She's like a leprechaun in disguise

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
She's my lucky charm

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
My lucky charm

Don't need a four leaf clover
Or a lucky penny
I only need to know you'll be there for me
Don't know what you do
To make me feel so well
You must be an angel with a magic spell

She's mine, mine
All mine
She's mine, mine
All mine

Don't need a four leaf clover
Or a lucky penny
I only need to know you'll be there for me
Don't know what you do
To make me feel so well
You must be an angel with a magic spell
