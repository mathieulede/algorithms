You're everything I've always wanted and more
That's for sure

I feel like somebody blew the dots off my dice
Feel so nice
To go crazy for someone so special
Tailor made, heaven sent just for me

This time I know it's real
Cause I asked my heart a question and it replied

Kisses don't lie
Kisses don't lie
Oh, no
Kisses never lie
Kisses don't lie
Kisses don't lie
Ooooh-ooooh

Kisses don't lie
Every time we do it
Kisses don't lie
They get right down to it

If you want to know the answer
Kiss and then decide cause kisses don't lie
Oooh, ooooh, oooh
Never lie

The first time I ever saw you, I felt a buzz
That's just what it was
Then passion got bold and whispered in my ear sweet love is here
So I gave in to the moment
Let it go
Let it flow
Cause I believe in true love at first sight
Then our lips touched for the very first time
Kisses don't lie
Kisses don't lie
Oh, no

They never, never lie
Kisses don't lie
Kisses don't lie

Oh no, no, no
Kisses don't lie
Every time we do it
Kisses don't lie
They get right down to it
If you want to know the answer
Kiss and then decide
Cause kissed don't lie
No no no no no
Never lie
Oooh, ooooh ooh oh
Kisses don't lie
Baby, no , no, no
Kisses
Never lie, never, never lie, oh-oh
Kisses don't lie
Every time we do it, kisses
Oooh, oh, oh
Never
Kisses, kisses
No they don't, never lie
Oooh, oh, oh

They never lie
You get right down to it
Oooh, oh, oh, baby

Never, never
The first time, I ever saw your face
Kisses don't lie
Kisses don't lie

Kisses don't lie, don't lie they don't lie
