It's late at night
I hear the rain outside my window pane
What I wanna do is sneak out and go to Lover's Lane
Me and You
But I can't take this feeling
Unless if it's in control
It's natural

Chorus:
Just like Romeo and Juliet
Jack and Jill were still in love forever
We're still in love
Side by side and heart to heart
Time reveals that we're still in love forever
We're still in love

We share the secret things that make each moment so divine
But we must be careful and let no one catch us this time
Oooh baby, love you
I kept my promise to love you and no one else
I can't help myself

Chorus (2x):
Just like Romeo and Juliet
Jack and Jill were still in love forever
We're still in love, still in love
Side by side and heart to heart
Time reveals that we're still in love forever
We're still in love, we're still in love

Baby, u know we're like no other
We're like a romance in history
We have something real special
Something we'll always keep
I'm glad you were the one I met
I love you Juliet

Just like Romeo and Juliet
Girl, we're still in love forever
We're still in love baby, together forever
Side by side and heart to heart
Girl, we're still in love forever
We're in still in love
I love you baby
Romeo and Juliet...
