Feels good
Everybody

Tender lover
Tender love

[Verse 1:]
Eleanor Rigby spends half her life
All alone
No fault of her own

Made a decision
Love has no place in her home
Love
It has a right to go

[Hook #1:]
Love has no limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so

Don't even give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on

We didn't didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

[Chorus:]
Tender lover
Girl, I'm so sorry
Well
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart

Tender love
So broken hearted
Well
I never meant to break your
Break your little tender heart

[Verse 2:]
Don't ever give up in spite of our love
Love is much too precious
It's greater than both of us

There's more than enough
Keep looking for love
Just be a believer
It'll give you what you want

[Hook #2:]
Sky is the limit
If you believe in love
It'll open up so

Don't ever give in
'Cause if it starts to give
Just hold on

We didn't
Didn't make it
But love'll get you by
If you only try
Just don't give up on love
'Cause it didn't work out this time

[Repeat Chorus:]

My tender lover

[Repeat x2:]
Tender lover
Tender love

[Repeat Hook #1:]

[Repeat Chorus:]
