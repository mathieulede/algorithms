Saw an old friend on the street
She said today's your wedding
My heart stopped
The tears dropped

Saw my whole life pass me by
I had to see you, baby
I never ran so fast before
I rushed inside the chapel door
You were waitin' all alone
You turned around and heard me call

Congratulations
I thought it would have been me
Standin' here with you
Congratulations
I hope you're happy

Cause as long as I can breathe
You'll always be the one for me, oh, oh

Why was I the last to know
I thought that we were special
My soul shakes
My heart breaks
As I turn and walk away
I can't believe it's over
We never really said goodbye
Thought we'd give it one more try
Felt our love was here to stay
And now today's your wedding day

Congratulations
I thought it would have been me
Standin' here with you
Congratulations
I hope you're happy

Brought the wishes, baby
Oh...oh...tonight you and me
Because you ???
I-I thought it should have been me, oh...oh...oh...

But as long as I can breathe
You'll always be the one for me
Cause as long as I can breathe
You'll always be the one for me

Congratulations
