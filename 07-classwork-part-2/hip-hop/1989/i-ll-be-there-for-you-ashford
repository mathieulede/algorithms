Ooh...hoo...oh...

I know you're scared
Cause I don't have the image of a hero
But no matter what comes our way or what we go through
I'll be there for you, ho...mmm...

And I can't say
That I can satisfy your every needs, oh
But you must know this, through your tears and fears
I care and there ain't nothin' we can't share

I'll be there for you (All you do is call)
I'll be there for you (I'll be there, be there when you fall)
When the world is closin' in and there's no one you can turn to
I'll be there for you (Oh...)

You're gonna need
Somebody you can lean on and be sure of
Though seasons may change, my love remains new
And I'll be there for you (Ooh...hoo...hoo...)

I know it's hard
To talk about emotions locked inside, oh...
But you've got to be free enough with me to share
And in the time of need I swear

I'll be there for you (Ooh...) (Reach out and grab my hand, girl)
I'll be there for you (Baby, baby, baby, I understand) (Ooh)
When the world is closin' in and there's no one you can turn to
I'll be there

I know you have a sense of who you are
That I admire, yeah
Yeah, and even the strong and the brave
You can get tired (Baby, baby)

But when everything goes wrong
And the night is cold, hold on
Don't need no luck, ifs, and or buts
Anytime, anyplace, any where (Yeah) (Yeah)

I'll be there for you (Reach out and grab my hand, girl) (Ooh)
I'll be there for you (Baby, baby, baby, I understand) (Ooh...)
When the world is closin' in and there's no one you can turn to
I'll be there

I'll be there for you (Baby, you know it)
I'll be there for you (I love you still, I love you still) (Ooh)
I'll be there for you ('Cause my love is guaranteed)
I'll be there for you (Oh...lean on me, lean on me)

I'll be there for you (I'll climb any mountain)
I'll be there for you (Baby) (I'll be there in a hurry) (Yeah) (Woo)
When the world is closin' in and there's no one you can turn to
I'll be there for you
