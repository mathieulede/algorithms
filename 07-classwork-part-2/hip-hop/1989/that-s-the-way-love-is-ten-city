Two people take a vow to be together
And live and love each other forever
They promise to love a lifetime
Funny thing

Then they change their minds
They both go their seperate ways and love is just a memory
But a young heart doesn't stay sad long

Another love soon comes along

That's the way love is
That's the way love is

That's the way love is

Two people don't get along
Deep down in

Both have feelings very strong

They try hard to conceal it
Their hearts burn 'cause they both know they can feel it

That's the way love is
That's the way love is

That's the way love is

Lovers leave without a reason
Feelings change just like seasons
In love nothing's for certain

There's no use in pretending what's behind the curtain

That's the way love is
That's the way love is

That's the way love is

No one knows how this feeling goes
It's hard to believe

Even stranger to conceive
It's so gratifying
Love's feeling
Ain't no denying
Yet it's so unfair when the feeling's no longer there
