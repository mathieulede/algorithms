You know it's about three o'clock when I looked at the time
And I had two more hours to go before I got to your love
And the time just kept ticking slower and slower
When I got to the front door
I thought about openin' the door with my key that
Seeing your lovely face right in front of me

Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout you all day long
And I just could not wait, baby, to get home to you
Food, forget about the dinner, oh, honey
'Cause the only thing I'm hungry for, oh, baby, is you
Just keep it comin', baby, come on

Don't stop your love (No, no)
Don't stop your love
Don't stop your love (I need it right now)
Don't stop your love

Unplug the phone, girl, so we won't be disturbed
But the way I want it, baby, is just you and me
Well, run your fingers through my hair, girl [Run your fingers through my hair], and love me down
'Cause your lovin' is the only thing tonight, girl, that I need
Just keep it comin', baby, come on

Don't stop your love (No, no, ooh)
Don't stop your love
Don't stop your love (I need your lovin' right now)
Don't stop your love (Ooh, baby)

Don't stop your love (Keep it comin' 24/7)
Don't stop your love
Don't stop your love (I need your lovin' right now)
Don't stop your love

Oh, girl, yeah
Love me

{Uh, uh, Jacci}
Love me down {Love you down, yeah, yeah, yeah}
Put your arms all around {I want you, boy}
Yeah, that's the way {Need you, boy, uh, uh}

Ooh, baby [Oh'oh'oh'oh'oh'oh']
Mmm'hmm'yeah, yeah [Whoa'whoa'baby]
Ooh, I can't wait, baby

Don't stop your love (Oh, just touch me, baby)
Don't stop your love (Bring your body next to mine, girl)
Don't stop your love, I can't wait for your love (Mmm'mmm'mmm' mmm' mmm')
Don't stop your love (Just touch me, baby)

Don't stop your love (Come on, girl, come on, girl, and touch me, baby)
Don't stop your love (I love it when you love me like you love me, girl)
Don't stop your love, I can't wait for you love
Don't stop your love (All night long, give me your lovin', baby)

Don't stop your love (Don't stop it, give it to me, girl, you know I want it, no')
Don't stop your love (Girl)

I wanna rub my fingers through your hair tonight, girl [I can't wait]
I wanna love you down, all the way down, baby
Touch me, girl, ooh, touch me, honey
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop, baby, no, no
Take me I'm yours [Don't stop your love]
Hold me, love me down, make this so good, girl [Don't stop your love]
Whoa, no, no, no, baby, yeah [Don't stop your love]
I love it when you love me like you love it, how you love it, girl, yeah, yeah
[Don't stop your love] Ooh, just unplug the phone, girl
I don't wanna be disturbed, I don't wanna be disturbed
I wanna love you down [Don't stop your love] all night long
I'm gonna love you down, I'm gonna keep it strong [Don't stop your love]
I wanna rock your body all night long [Don't stop your love], girl
I wanna do it right [Don't stop your love], I wanna do it all night
Just you and me [Don't stop your love], nobody else
It's just you and me [Don't stop your love], all by ourselves
[Don't stop your love]
