Now that we are older
Our hearts have all grown up
Just a little wiser
But are we wise enough?
Watching imitations of the real thing
You and I have both been fooled before

But this time, we win
Our ship has just come in
Forget the past
We've saved the best for last

Now that we are younger
Than we were last night
You can be my arrow
I'll be your guiding light
There isn't any danger we can't handle

But this time, we win
Our ship has just come in
Forget the past
We've saved the best for last
Tonight entwined
This love is genuine
Forget the past
We've saved the best for last

We've both had enough of hesistation
Didn't matter, didn't matter

But this time, we win
Our ship has just come in
Forget the past
We've saved the best for last
Tonight entwined
This love is genuine
Forget the past
We've saved the best for last

(Repeat and fade)
