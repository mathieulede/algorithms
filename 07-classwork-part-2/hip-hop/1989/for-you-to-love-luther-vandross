Verse 1:
It's the middle of the night
And I can't sleep at all (I'm so uptight)
Tossin' and turnin' is how I've spent the time
I've got so much on my mind...hey
Something's got a hold on me
I think it's love, don't you agree?...(It's got to be)
I don't feel better
I know what I've got to do
I've got to get next to you

Chorus 1:
So I came here (for you to love)
In the pouring rain (for you to love)
And I know I'm ready (for you to love)
I'll be the best I can (honey, for you to love)
'Cause honey it's you I love

Verse 2:
I start to wonder what is true
And I get so confused (What should I do?...)
You make me worry
When you say you understand
But that I can't be your man
Something's gotta change your mind
Now, if I get my love to you in time
(Then you'll be mine)
Ooh, I've got to get over
Yes, that's what I've gotta do
Look out 'cause I'm after you

Chorus 2:
I came here (for you to love)
In a hurricane (for you to love)
Just to be ready (for you to love)
I'll be the kind of man (honey, for you to love)
'Cause honey it's you I love

Bridge:
I wanted to see you
I wanted to make your day
I got myself ready
To hear the words you say
'Cause sometimes you talk to me so emotionally
But then, you pull it back, baby
Just let yourself love me

Chorus 3:
I came here (for you to love)
I took a train, my dear (for you to love)
So, you know I'm ready (for you to love)
Never doubt, never fear (honey, for you to love)
'Cause oh honey it's you I love
