Something in the way you make me feel
Feel, feel (Tell you, baby)
Something in the way you make me feel (Oh)
Feel, feel (And it makes me feel real good)

I've been up and I've been down
Until you helped me put my feet on solid ground
I've been rich and I've been poor
Then you showed me that there's so much more
Than the rat race and the fast pace
Could ever offer me
When I look back, baby
You've always been there for me

Something in the way you make me feel (No doubt)
Feel (I wanna shout), feel (I tell you, baby)
Something in the way you make me feel (Oh)
Feel, feel (And it makes me feel real good, hmm)

Something in the way you make me feel (Oh oh)
Something in the way you make me feel (Oh oh oh)

I've been talked about and I've been scorned
I've been praised and I've been adorned
I've met all kinds, traveled over this world
And still your love turned me into a different girl

You got the right touch and I don't know what
Came over me
But when I woke up, honey
It was so plain to see

Something in the way you make me feel (I wanna talk about it)
Feel (I wanna shout), feel
Something in the way you make me feel (Oh)
Feel (You make me feel), feel (I tell you, baby)

Something in the way you make me feel (Oh, it's something)
Feel (Yes, it's something), feel (I tell you, baby)
Something in the way you make me feel
Feel (Oh), feel (And it makes me feel real good, real good)

Something in the way you make me feel (Oh oh)
You make me feel real good-good-good-good
Something in the way you make me feel (Yeah yeah)
You make me feel real good-good-good-good (Oh oh)

You got the right touch and I don't know what
Came over me
When I woke up, honey
It was so plain to see

Something in the way you make me feel (Ain't no doubt about it)
Feel (I wanna shout about it), feel (Tell the world about it)
Something in the way you make me feel (I wanna talk about it)
Feel (Yeah, yeah), feel (I tell you, baby)

Something in the way you make me feel (You make feel)
Feel (You make me feel), feel (Oh)
Something in the way you make me feel (You make me feel)
Feel (You make me feel), feel (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

Something in the way (Ooh) you make me feel (You make feel)
Feel (You make me feel), feel (You make me feel real good all over, yeah)
Something in the way you make me feel (You turn me in and out)
Feel (You make me scream and shout), feel (Oh oh oh )

Something in the way you make me feel (You make feel, oh)
Feel (You make me feel), feel (Oh)
Something in the way you make me feel (You make me feel)
Feel (You make me feel), feel (Tell you, babe)

Something in the way you make me feel
Feel, feel (Touch that I need so much)
Something in the way you make me feel
Feel, feel

Something in the way you make me feel
