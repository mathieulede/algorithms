What a ray of sunshine
What a stroke of magic
What a lucky day
When you can into my life
Love can turn up in the strangest places

When I saw your face
I felt my dreams come alive
And now I know for certain
There'll be no more hurting now

This is as good as it gets
Holding you close brings such happiness
I've been in love before
But this is a whole lot more
'Cause you bring out my best
This is as good as it gets

I was moving too fast
I was going nowhere
So empty inside
Nothing could fill the need

What a revelation
What a happy ending
Life is a dance
And it's love who takes the lead
And now I know for certain
That there'll be no more hurting now

Oh, and this is as good as it gets
Holding you close brings me such happiness
Well, I've been in love before

But this is a whole lot more
'Cause you bring out my best
Oh, whoa...
And this is as good as it gets

And I believe it was destiny
That brought you to me
Say, I believe
That true love has come finally

Oh, and this is as good as it gets
Holding you close brings such happiness
Well, I've been in love before
But this is a whole lot more

'Cause you bring out my best
Yeah
And this is as good as it gets
Yeah

And this is as good as it gets
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, whoa
So good, baby
So good

And this is as good as it gets
And oh
What a ray of sunshine
Yeah, yeah
So good
