[Verse 1:]
I realize that now our love is past
Tried so hard to make it last
Feelings are far gone
They seem to fade away
But yet I can hear him say

We did try
Tried our best
To make it through those times
Let's stop
Don't go any further
'Cause I need some time

[Chorus:]
Darlin' I
Know you never meant to make me cry
I never understood your reasons why
And darlin' I
Know you never ment to make me cry
These lonely nights without you
I guess it's goodbye

[Verse 2:]
And I never thought
That I would hear you say
I should go on my own way
Tell me
Can't you see
The changes that you put me through

I wonder if you really knew
How much I tried my best
To make it through those times

But you said stop
Don't go any further
'Cause I need more time
Oh, baby
And...

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
Darlin' I
Know you never meant to make me cry
I never understood your reasons why
And darlin' I
Know you never ment to make me cry
These lonely nights without you
I guess it's goodbye

Darlin' I
Know you never meant to make me cry
I never understood your reasons why
And darlin' I
Know you never ment to make me cry
These lonely nights without you
I guess it's goodbye
