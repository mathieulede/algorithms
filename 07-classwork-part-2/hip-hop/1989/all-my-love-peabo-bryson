La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, gave you all my heart
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, love you from the start

You, you never knew
That someone like me
Could love only you, whoa
I would be satisfied
Knowing you love me
Deep down inside

Whoa-whoa, fools rush in
Anywhere, anywhere
Wise men will never go
But a wise man will never fall in love
He will never learn
What a fool already knows, yeah

Sweet like a fantasy
Makin' love to you
Is a beautiful dream, yeah
Such, such a gentle touch
When I'm close to you
I need you so much

Whoa, fools rush in
Anywhere, anywhere
Wise men will never go
But a wise man will never fall in love
He will never learn
What a fool already knows
