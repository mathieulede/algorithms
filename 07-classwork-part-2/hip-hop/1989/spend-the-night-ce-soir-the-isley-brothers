Spend the night with me tonight
Ce soir tonight, golden lady
Spend the night with me tonight
Tonight, tonight, golden lady

Why go home to an empty bed?
Why try to fight those passions in your head?
We're two hearts on fire, fueled by a simple touch
With love and desire, we both need so much

You're the girl, only girl so right for me
You're the girl, golden girl

Spend the night with me tonight
Ce soir tonight
Spend the night with me tonight
Tonight, tonight

Listen, I'm not out just for an easy lay
I really love you in a special way
Unlock the door, girl, we can throw away the key
See, I want more of you and girl, here's all of me

You're the girl, only girl so right for me
You're the girl, golden girl

Spend the night with me tonight
Ce soir tonight
Spend the night with me tonight
Tonight tonight, golden lady

Spend the night with me tonight
Ce soir tonight
Spend the night with me tonight
Tonight, tonight

Well, well, well
Thank you, lady, thank you

You're the girl, only girl so right for me
You're the girl, golden girl

Spend the night with me tonight
Ce soir tonight
Spend the night with me tonight
Tonight, tonight

Spend the night with me tonight
Ce soir tonight
Spend the night with me tonight
Tonight, tonight

Spend the night with me tonight
Spend the night, ce soir tonight
Tonight, tonight
Spend the night, ce soir tonight
