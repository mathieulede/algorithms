[Verse 1:]
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky

Imagine all the people
Living for today
Yeah, yeah

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
Whoa, no
And no religion too

Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
You may say that I'm a dreamer
Oh, but you know
That I'm not the only one, no
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will be as one

[Verse 2:]
Imagine all possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or for hunger
Whoa, no
A brotherhood of man

I want you to imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
(Sharing it, woo, sharing it)

[Chorus:]
You may say that I'm a dreamer
Oh, but you know
That I'm not the only one, no

I hope someday you will join us
And the world
The world will live as one

(The world, the world will be as one)
Like brothers and sisters
(The world, the world will be as one)
We're gonna be together
As one walking hand in hand
Ooh

(The world, the world will be as one)
(Live as one)
The world will live as one
