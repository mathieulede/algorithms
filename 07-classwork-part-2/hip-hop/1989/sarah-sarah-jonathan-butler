Saw her across the crowded room
She looks so good
Memories came rushing into my head (mmmm)
There was a sparkle in her eyes
Was it for me?
Just my imagination running wild (oh yeah)

I see the more things change
The more they stay the same
Thought I was past the pain
But one thought of you and it's back again

((Chorus))
Sarah sarah
What happened to you and I? (Sarah)
Sarah sarah
How did the fire die? (Sarah)

This time I said I would be strong (though emotions rushed in)
So that I wouldn't fall apart (no way)
How could we watch our dreams
Crumble into dust, girl

There's so much more life has
In store (in store) for the two of us

Sarah sarah
What happened to you and I? (Sarah)
Sarah sarah
How did the fire die? (Sarah)

I must admit, baby
That love never dies
Deep in my heart, girl
A bit of you still survives

How could we watch our dreams
Crumble into dust, girl
There's so much more life has
In store (in store) for the two of us

((Repeat Chorus))
