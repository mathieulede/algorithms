She's a sweet little girl
You can treat her right
Feel nice and hold her tight

Only tenderonis can
Give a special love
A special kind of love that
Makes you feel good inside

And all that it can do for you
Give it a chance, girl

And if you find a tenderoni
That is right for you
Make it official
Give her your love

Wishing they were home alone

With the smell of sweet perfume
This is what a real tenderoni
Likes to do for you
