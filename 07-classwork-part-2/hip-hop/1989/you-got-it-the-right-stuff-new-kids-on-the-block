Remember when we said, "Girl, please don't go"
And how I'd be loving you forever...
Taught you 'bout hanging tough
As long as you've got the right stuff

Didn't we, girls? Ooh ooh
Didn't we, girls? Aah, aah

Well I guess it's a brand new day after all
Every time we hear the curtain call
See the girls with the curls in their hair
The buttons and the pins and the loud fanfares

Tonight, tonight

Remember when we traveled 'round the world
We met a lot of people and girls...
Fan mail from everywhere
Showed us how you care

Didn't it, girls? Ooh, ooh
Didn't it, girls? Aah, aah

Well, I guess it's a brand new day after all
Every time we hear the curtain call
See the girls with the curls in their hair
The buttons and the pins and the loud fanfares

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight

Sounds good
Hey fellas, let's do it
Here we go

La, la, la, la, la, la tonight
La, la, la, la, la, la tonight

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, alright

Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, It's time to take it home now

La, la, la, la, la, la tonight
La, la, la, la, la, la tonight

La, la, la, la, la, la tonight
La, la, la, la, la, la tonight
