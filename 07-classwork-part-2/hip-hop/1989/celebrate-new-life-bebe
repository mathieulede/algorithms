[Verse 1: CeCe Winans]
It's one on one I'm talking
I'm talking (Me and you)
Do you believe I love you?
And you say (I know you do)
I'll never leave you lonely
I'll be there (I know you will)

And when you learn to trust me
I'll take you somewhere far away
No need for memories 'cause yesterday's gone
Hey

[Chorus]
Celebrate new life
Beyond the Milky Way
Leave your cares behind
Leave them right away
There's a song that rings
Sing 'Oh, happy day'
Ain't it good to know?
Love is here

[Verse 2: BeBe Winans]
It's one on one I'm talking
I'm talking (Me and you)
Do you believe I love you?
And you say (I know you do)
I'll never leave you lonely
I'll be there (I know you will)

And when you learn to trust me
I'll take you somewhere far away
No need for memories, yesterday's gone
Yeah, oh, my, my, oh

[Chorus]
Celebrate new life
Beyond the Milky Way
Oh, leave those cares behind
Leave them right away
There's a song that rings
Sing 'Oh, happy day'
Ain't it good to know
Love is here
Say it again
Celebrate new life
Beyond the Milky Way
Oh, leave those cares behind
Leave them right away
There's a song that rings
Sing 'Oh, happy day'
Oh, ain't it good to know
Love is here
Hey, I'm talking love
Love is here
Oh, I'm talking love
Love is here
Yes, it is

Celebrate (Come on)
It's time to celebrate
Celebrate
I said celebrate
Celebrate (new life)
It's time to celebrate
Oh-whoa-oh...oh-oh-oh-oh celebrate
Celebrate
New way of walking, new way to living, new way of dancing
I said, said celebrate
Sounds like a party
Sounds like a good time
Sounds like a party
Sounds like a good time
Sounds like a party (Repeated until fade out)
