All the years of living alone
Thinking of myself
Were filled with days of emptiness
And room for no one else
I found a haven in isolation
With nothing to lose
Safe and lonely thinking of only
What I had to prove
I was lost without you
I was lost without you
Like being frozen in time
Disillusioned with life
Until I knew
I found myself in you

I remember being afraid
Of my destiny
Fear of change or losing my way
And my identity
Then something bigger just took over
And it happened so fast
Lying here, my head on your shoulder
Reliving the past

I was lost without you
I was lost without you
Like being frozen in time
Disillusioned with life
Until I knew
I found myself in you
I found myself in you

And all the love I needed to give
Finally found a home
You've given me a reason to live
Can't go back
Don't let go

I was lost without you
Lost without you
Like being frozen in time
Going out of my mind
Until I knew
I was lost without you
Lost without you
Like being frozen in time
Disillusioned with life
Until I knew
I found myself in you
I found myself in you
