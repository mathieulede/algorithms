[Hook:]
Joy and pain
Like sunshine and rain
Joy and pain
Like sunshine and rain

[Verse 1:]
Well I'm the new kid, I'm just comin' up
A lot of rappers think that I can't tear it up
Well I'm 'a show 'em and ignore 'em
And when they think I ain't lookin' I floor 'em
I mean take 'em out I keep groovin'
A slick bass line keep the beat movin'
They can't take it they just fake it
They wonder how the Rob Base make it
I get I'll, you know the deal
Cause this is how the Rob Base feels

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I keep smokin', hot like fire
You had the turn, now retire
Don't talk back, I'm not a new jack
Cause I'm fresher than you, an' you're whacked
I keep tryin', I'm not lyin'
Up to number 1 is where I'm flyin'
I won't slow down cause I'm the new kid
With the devastatin' sound that hits
In the house where I used to practice
No one knew the Rob exists, but now
I'm gettin' greedy, don't lead me
The wrong way cause is just might, might, might
Bring me down, I'll have to fight to get back up
Move away cause I just won't slack up

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Now, I go to shows to watch other MCs rock
And if they're good, I don't knock
The way they perform cause I like to see a good show
After that, go play ceelo, y'know
Cause I'm a leader, no I'm not a follower
And MCs like you I swallow 'em
So don't look and try to judge me
Because you think that I'm another MC, well
I'm the new kind, I just moved around
But that don't mean I can't rip up the town
Me an' my boys, we make noise
I hate MCs that think they're with toys
I'm hittin' harder than any other MC
Who try to come up and go against me

[Hook:]

[Verse 4:]
Not from the old school or from the new
Applaud the boom, do what you want to
Talk to me then try to put me down
We used to be cool now we don't hang around
Used to be friends but now we're foes
Ask me why, man, no one knows
Maybe jealousy between you and me
Could be the fame, could be the money
I'm goin' for mine and I don't really care
Cause the spotlight Rob Base don't share
I'm the headliner of this show
And you're just a kid and you need to grow, because
