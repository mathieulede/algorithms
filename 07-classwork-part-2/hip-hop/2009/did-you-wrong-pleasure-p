[Intro]
You know, I want you all to just sit back and think for a second
You know what I mean?
Now, there's a lot of haters out there hating on peoples relationships and stuff
Don't nobody wanna see you happy
They always try to take your joy, bring you down
But you gotta be the one to sit by your mate and say "I'm gonna be with you no matter what"
You know what I'm saying? Fuck it, I did wrong, you did wrong too
You know what I'm saying?
But we gotta put up with each others shit
And the easiest thing to do is leave, you dig?
Anyway, check this out...

[Verse 1]
I don't want to lose this relationship
So we gotta stay strong, don't wanna move on
I know you're sick and tired of the fussing and the fighting, and the cussing
Well, I love you ... and you love me too

[Hook]
I did you wrong, you did me wrong
I take you back, you take me back
I did you wrong girl, you did me wrong girl
I'll take you back, I'll take you back
No matter what you do
No matter what you say
No matter how far you go
Don't take your love away
Because I love you
And girl, I want you
And girl, I need you
So let's just work it out

[Verse 2]
I ain't tryna waste your time
And, I ain't tryna waste my time
There ain't no need to waste no time
Cause we done put in too much time
I ain't tryna waste your time
I ain't tryna waste my time
Ain't no need to waste no time
Cause we done put in too much time

When you're in a relationship
The easiest thing for you to do
Is to leave
You gotta stick it out, and work it out
And stick it out, and work it out
And stick it out
Cause at the end of the day...

[Hook]

[Bridge (TALKING)]
I love you baby, I need you in my life
You know what I'm saying?
I'm sick and tired of the arguing and all that good stuff
I mean, I'm pleading on this track because I really really love you
And, I really want us to work out
You know? I want to marry you baby
You know? I want you to be in my life for the rest of my life
You know what I'm saying?
Anyway, I'm just talking a whole lot of jibberjabber
But uhm me without you is like the moon without the sun
And the sun without the moon
Pleasure P without Pretty Ricky
You know what I'm saying?
A blunt with no dro
Ecstasy with no body
You get what I'm saying baby?
You dig? Aight.. you dig
Holla at you boy
I love you

[Hook]
