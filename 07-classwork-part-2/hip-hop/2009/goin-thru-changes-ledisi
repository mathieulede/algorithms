I wish that I could stay
But stayin' here confuses me more, so I'll go
'Cause there's someone else who cares for me like you do

You are my friend, and I don't wanna cross the line
It's so easy to make you mine
I keep pushin' you away
'Cause you give me what I miss at home

I'm goin' through changes
And how do I let you go?
My mind is goin' through changes, goin' through some changes, yeah
And I can't let him go

Please don't touch me there
Temptation wants to rule me
I can't do what my body is callin' out for
I'm so confused

You know what I like, and you wanna give me all of you
And I think about it, too
But I keep goin' through these changes
'Cause there's so much that I miss at home

I'm goin' through changes
How do I let you go? I gotta get it together, ooh, ooh, ooh
My mind is goin' through changes
And I can't let him go

I know what you want, I know what you want
Everything' about us will change, it's gonna change
Everything I feel says stay here with you
I wanna stay here with you

I don't really know what to do
I don't know what to do
I can't get nothin' at home, nothin'
The more I think about it, I'm so confused, so confused

I'm goin' through some changes
I'm goin' through changes, and how do I let you go?
My mind is goin' through changes, some changes
And I can't let him go

I'm goin' through changes, don't know what to do, don't know what
How do I let you go?
My mind is goin' through changes, goin' through some changes
And I can't let him go

I'm goin' through changes, goin' through some changes
How do I let you go?
My mind is goin' through changes
And I can't let him go

I'm goin' through changes
