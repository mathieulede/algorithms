Only place i wan be is everywhere u gon be
Us apart me don wan see like my heartbeat
She keepiin me alive saviin me from my demise
Saparate from me a day & i would've die
Must ii infusize how much ii love them
Sexy lips & them pretty eyes
French kissiin them curves & ur hips
Stay thirsty for them iinner thighs
When our bodies intervine ii can reconize
A special connetion that ii
Would never jerpodize just to socialize
When ii kno that ii won't survive
No good byes out my emotions
Ive kno you was dead wrong & ii apologize
Cuz can no women satisfy me they dont qualified
Unlike a lot of guys see ii ain't gotta liie

A man wiith a lot of pride but ii realize
Ii ain't got shiit iif ii aiint got u in my liife
