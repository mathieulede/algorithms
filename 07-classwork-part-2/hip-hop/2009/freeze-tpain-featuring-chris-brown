[Intro: T-Pain]
I get it down on the dance flo'
Watch this, hey, you don't even know girl
Woah, huh, c'mere

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
You know what I do, if you can do it too
Then that's just somethin' that makes me more attracted to you
And I, and I wanna see you break it down, for me
Yes, we in this private party, girl I like your body
But can you tic, tic, tic, tic, tic, tic, pop lock and drop it?
'Cause I, and I wanna see you break it down, for me, watch this

[Hook: T-Pain]
Girl, I've been waiting all night to see you dance like me
And you gon' sweat your outfit out tryna dance like me
Now let me see you, ah
Now freeze, like me, ooh now, shawty

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Girl, I want a battle, meet me downstairs
Bring your dancin' shoes and something to tie you hair
'Cause I'm, 'cause I'm about to break it down, on you
I see you with ya friends, you don't wanna get embarrassed
I know you see my bling, bling, check out the karats
'Cause I, I'm 'bout to break it down, on you

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Girl, I've been waiting all night to see you dance like me
And you gon' sweat your outfit out tryna dance like me

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & T-Pain]
Girl, let's get it popping, crackin', tell me how you feel
Let's get up on this floor and do this thing for real
'Cause we, you and me can really break it down together
Watch me slide on ya, watch me ride on ya
You ain't gotta say it, you think I'm fly, don't ya?
'Cause we, you and me can really break it down, oh, oh, oh

[Hook: Chris Brown]
