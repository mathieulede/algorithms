Sometimes you can work it out
Sometimes you can't
Sometimes you're forced to watch everything fall apart
It's outta your hands

Sometimes leaving is easy
Sometimes it ain't
Sometimes it hurts to know
The loving you had is slowly fading away

You can say whatever you like
As long as we just say goodbye
Blame it on me
Say it's my fault

Say that I left you outside in the cold
With a broken heart
I really don't care
I ain't crying no more

Say I'm a liar
A cheater
Say anything that you want as long
As it's over

I ain't a quitter
I just ain't the type
I tried to see you through
I tried to make it to the finishing line

You thought it was meant to be
I admit so did I
Every once in a while
You think you figured it out
Sometimes you're not right

You can say whatever you like
As long as we just say goodbye
Blame it on me
Say it's my fault

Say that I left you outside in the cold
With a broken heart
I really don't care
I ain't crying no more

Say I'm a liar
A cheater
Say anything that you want
As long as it's over

Yes, I love you
But I really got to lose you
Freedom's where I wanna be
Yes, I'll probably always love you
But I'm moving
I gotta do this for me

Blame it on me
Say it's my fault
Say that I left you outside in the cold
With a broken heart
I really don't care
I ain't crying no more

Say I'm a liar
A cheater
Say anything that you want

Blame it on me
Say it's my fault
Say that I left you outside in the cold
With a broken heart
I really don't care
I ain't crying no more

Say I'm a liar
A cheater
Say anything that you want
As long as it's over
