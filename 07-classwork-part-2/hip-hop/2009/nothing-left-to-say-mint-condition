(Verse 1):
Love was so strong
At least at the beginning
Who would've thought
That there'd ever be an ending
We had it all
But it's like we've run into a wall

Now we try to talk
But just end up fighting
Try making up
But there's just no denying
Just ain't the same no more
What are we putting ourselves through all this for

You talk and hear me
But you can't communicate
Cause you're not lis'ning
Know these are two differnt things
Now I see what it means to have been
Blinded by the one you love so deeply
Cause

(Chorus):
The very things that made me love you
Are the things pushing me away, now (now)
In tears we stand here
With Nothing Left To Say

And all I could do for you
I should've done before (now)
In tears we stand here
There's Nothing Left To Say

(Verse 2):
You touch'd my heart
And were so givin
Spare it so free
You drew me in it
I fell so deep
I could not see my life
Without you in it

Girl you gave me
Alot of attention
Somehow the feeling turned
Into crazy possessive
It was always there
But I didn't look deeper
If I would've I'da seen the limits

You talk and hear me
But you can't communicate
Cause you're not lis'ning
Know these are two differnt things
Now I see what it means to have been
Blinded by the one you love so deeply

I had my pride girl
And you had your pain
So deep inside you
Wanted to have your say
Irritated, frustrated and hurt
Baby this is so confusing
Girl I thought this was the real thing for sure

The very things that made me love you
Are the things pushing me away, now (away now)
In tears we stand here
With Nothing Left To Say

And all I could do for you (And All I Could Do For You)
I should've done before (before, oh in tears)
In tears we stand here (oh)
There's Nothing Left To Say

(Bridge):
Sayyy-ay-e-ay-ay-ay-ay (Nothin', Nothin')
Ayy-e-ayy-ay-ay-ay (Nothinnn', Nothin')

Wish I had more words
To try and encourage
Us to find a way
Cause there's Nothing Left To Say

(Chrous):
The very things that made me love you
Are the things pushing me away now (pushing me away now, oh)
In tears we stand here (ooh, ooh, Nothing)
With nothing left to say

(And I Could Do For You)
And all I could do for you
(I Should've done before it's true)
I should've done before (now)
(Should've done it before baby, yeah)
In tears we stand here (ooh, ooh!, oh)
There's Nothing Left To Say

The very things that made me love you (Made me love you)
Are the things pushing me away, now (Oh, In tears we stand here)
In tears we stand here (oh, Oo, oh)
With Nothing Left To Say (To Say-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)

And all I could do for you (All I Could Do!)
I should've done before (Yeah!)
In tears we stand here (Before)
There's Nothing Left To Say (No-Thing, Left to)
Say-ay-ay-ay-ay

Yeah, yeah, oh, Ooo, oh, oh, oh
And Baby there's
Not-thing-Left-Tooo
Sayyyyy
