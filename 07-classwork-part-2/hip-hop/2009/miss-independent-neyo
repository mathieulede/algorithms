[Verse 1]
Ooh, there's something about
Just something about the way she move
And I can't figure it out
There's something about her
Said, ooh, there's something about
The kind of woman that want you but don't need you
And I can't figure it out
There's something about her

[Pre-Hook]
Cause she walk like a boss
Talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss
Do what a boss
Do, she got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kinda girl I need

[Hook]
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Won't you come and spend a little time?

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Ooh, the way we shine
Miss Independent

[Verse 2]
Ooh there's something about
The kind of woman that can do for herself
I look at her and it makes me proud
There's something about her
There's something oh so sexy about
The kind of woman that don't even need my help
She said she got it, she got it, no doubt
There's something about her

[Pre-Hook]
Cause she work like a boss, play like a boss
Car and a crib, she 'bout to pay them both off
And her bills are paid on time
She's made for a boss, only a boss
Anything less she's telling them to get lost
That's the girl that's on my mind

[Hook]
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Won't you come and spend a little time?

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Ooh, the way we shine
Miss Independent

[Bridge]
Her favorite thing to say: "Don't worry, I got it"
And everything she got: best believe she bought it
She gonna steal my heart, ain't no doubt about it
Girl, you're everything I need
Said you're everything I need

[Hook]
She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Won't you come and spend a little time?

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
Miss Independent
Ooh, the way we shine
Miss Independent

Miss Independent
That's why I love her
