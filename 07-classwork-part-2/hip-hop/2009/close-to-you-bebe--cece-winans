I just want to be close to you
Sunshine, moonlight, delight just a couple words describing who you are
Lovely, so lovely - want everyone to know why I'm in love with you

Patient and strong, always, no matter what i face you've been there to see me through
Just right (right on) on time, it took a while to see that your love was true

Now no one can (undo)
Cause i belong (to you)
Until the end (of time)
It's good to know (good to know you're mine)
And all i want (to say)
Until my dying (dying day)
I just want to be close to you

Honest and sweet
Heaven is where i want to be
Where i am when I'm with you
Perfect, yes perfect
It took a while to see that this was love true

Now no one can (undo)
Cause i belong (to you)
Until the end (of time)
It's good to know (you're mine)
And all i want (all i want to do is say - til my dying day)
I just want to be close to you

Now following me sis...
Say dah dah, u say (dah dah)
Say dah dah
Dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
Dah dah (mmm,mmm) dah dah
It took a while to see, now we know the truth

Now -no one can (undo)
I belong (to you)
Until the end (of time)
Good to know (good to know you're mine)
And all i want (all i want to say - till my dying day)
I just want to be close to you
Ya ya ya ya (how long will you stay)
I just wanna be close to you
