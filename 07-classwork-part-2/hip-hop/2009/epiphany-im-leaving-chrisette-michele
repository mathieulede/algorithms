(And then it comes to me like an epiphany)

It's Over
Over

It’s over
Over

[Verse 1:]
Second night in a row
You didn't come home
I'm watching my phone
Waiting for it to ring, ring, ring

Sitting in the house on the couch with the TV on (on)
All night all alone (alone)
Every time same old thing, thing, thing

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving (leaving), I'm leaving
No more wonderin what you've been doin
Where you been sleeping
(it's over)
I'm leaving
(it’s over)
I'm leaving
(yea e yeah)

[Verse 2:]
So you walk in
(you walk in)
The next morning
(the next morning)
To find me smiling
Like nothing ever happened

You give me some excuse
(some excuse)
Like you always do
(like you always do)
I just kiss your cheek
And this is what I tell you, you, you

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend ( your girlfriend)
I'm leaving, (I’m leaveing) I'm leaving
No more wonderin what you've been doin
Where you been sleeping
(it's over)
I'm leaving
(It’s over)
I'm leaving
(yea e yeah)

[Bridge:]
How many times did I fall for your lies
How many times did I sit home and cry
Never questioning why? why? why? why?
It just came to me
Like an epiphany
How about I just leave-e-e-e

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving, I'm leaving
No more wonderin what you've been doin
Where you been sleeping
(it's over)
I'm leaving
(it’s over)
I'm leaving
(yea e yeah)
(repeat)
