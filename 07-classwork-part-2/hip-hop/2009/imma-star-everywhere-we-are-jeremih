I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Live the night... Like there's no tomorrow

I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Live the night... Like there's no tomorrow

Ooh ooh oohhh

I got money... I don't need the rings
I'm a pimp... I don't need a cane
Big bills Charlie... You could keep the change
Now that I got the torch... I'm a keep the flame
I'm a keep my aim... Gotta make the big shots
In my linen suit... Louis V flip flops
Got a bad bitch... Her hair & nails tip top
Jeremih got the game on a slipknot
Just before the stacks... I got rubber bands
Consumers only want you to supply the man
So here I am... Check my DNA
Getting money's the only thing on my resume

I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Live the night... Like there's no tomorrow

Ooh ooh oohhh

I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Live the night... Like there's no tomorrow
Ooh ooh oohhh

Like the dealer ship, I got beaucoup cars
Penitentiary... I keep beaucoup bars
Flow so hot... Fried in beaucoup lard
Hollywood ground, I got beaucoup stars
Don't need Roger Ebert or the paparazzi
Take more than the red... [? ] stop me
[? ]
Hit the weed man... So I can get in touch with Mary Jane
You're a Scorpio... Girl get over here
Grab me all night... Like you came to Paul Revere
Kissing on my neck... Nibbling on my ear
You say you wanna chill... Go ahead & have a beer

I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Live the night... Like there's no tomorrow

Ooh ooh oohhh

I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Live the night... Like there's no tomorrow

Ooh ooh oohhh

Ohkay. Now I be ballin'
I. I. I be. I be ballin'
You can catch me in the air. air
I'll be rollin'
When I'm tryna grab some gear. gear...
I be mallin'
In the middle of the club...
Wth 1 dolla u callin'
Skeezer
The camera's clicking

Especially at the end of the month
When it's just not an option
Now they got that spotlight on me
Why they put that on me
Now I'm never lonely
Cause everywhere I go it's...

F L A S H Y L I G H T S!

Everywhere we are
