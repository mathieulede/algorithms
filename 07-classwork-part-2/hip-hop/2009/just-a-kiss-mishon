We ain't gotta go all the way
But, baby, we can do somethings
A little game I like to play
Listen, shawty
We ain't gotta go all the way
But, baby, we can do somethings
A little game I like to play
Girl, you don't need to be nervous
I know I just met you, these other girls lookin'
But I never disrespect you, babe
This's gonna be okay, yeah
You was pretty as a picture
I want you in my room
You whisper in my ear
I don't wanna move too soon, okay
This's gonna be okay, yeah
Ooh, your body's soft
Now take that jacket off
I think we gon' be good friends, yeah
Shawty, no need to be scared
If you don't wanna go there
No days before we begin
We ain't gotta go
We ain't gotta go all the way
But, baby, we can do somethings
A little game I like to play
Just a kiss, just a kiss, just a kiss
Ooh, girl
Just a kiss, just a kiss
Can we play, can we play?
And we're flirtin' and jokin'
And I can see that you're open
Everything I'm doing
I can tell that you love it, babe
You like the way we play
So we touchin' and teasin'
Now you got me feelin'
We both know we want
The next step for pleasin', babe
But we can wait another day
Ooh, your body's soft
Now take that jacket off
I think we gon' be good friends
Shawty, no need to be scared
If you don't wanna go there
No days before we begin
We ain't gotta go all the way
But, baby, we can do some things
A little game I like to play
Just a kiss, just a kiss, just a kiss
Ooh, girl
Just a kiss, just a kiss
Can we play, can we play?
We ain't gotta go all the way, no
'Cause it's called
Just a kiss, just a kiss, just a kiss
Ooh, girl
Just a kiss, just a kiss
We ain't gotta go all the way
But, baby, we can do somethings
A little game I like to play
Just a kiss, just a kiss, just a kiss
Ooh, girl
Just a kiss, just a kiss
Can we play, can we play?
Just a kiss, just a kiss, just a kiss
Ooh, girl
Just a kiss, just a kiss
Can we play, can we play?
Just a kiss, just a kiss
