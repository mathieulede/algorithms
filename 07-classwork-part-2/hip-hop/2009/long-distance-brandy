[Verse 1]
There's only so many songs that
I can sing to pass the time
And I'm running out of things to do to
Get you off my mind, oh
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face every day

[Chorus]
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me

[Post-Chorus]
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me

[Verse 2]
Now the minutes feel like hours
And the hours feel like days while I'm away
You know right now I can't be home
But I'm coming home soon
Coming home soon
All I have is this picture in a frame
That I hold close to see your face every day

[Chorus]
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me

[Post-Chorus]
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me

[Bridge]
Can you hear me cryin', oh?
Can you hear me cryin', oh?
Can you hear me cryin', oh?
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
With you is where I'd rather be
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me
I wish that you were here with me
But we're stuck where we are
And it's so hard, we're so far
This long distance is killin' me

[Post-Chorus]
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me
It's so hard, it's so hard
Where we are, where we are, you're so far
This long distance is killin' me

[Outro]
There's only so many songs
That I can sing to pass the time
