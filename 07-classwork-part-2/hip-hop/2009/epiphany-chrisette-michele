[Intro:]
Yep
Huh uh

And then it comes to me like an epiphany

It's over
It's over
It's over
It's over

[Verse 1:]
Second night in a row
You didn't come home
I'm watching my phone
Waiting for it to ring

Sitting in the house
On the couch with the TV on

All night
All alone
Every time
Same old thing

[Chorus:]
So I think I'm just about over
Being your girlfriend (girlfriend)
I'm leaving
I'm leaving (leaving)

No more wondering
What you've been doing
Where you been sleeping
(It's over)

I'm leaving
(It's over)
I'm leaving
(Yea, yea, yeah)

[Verse 2:]
So you walked in
The next morning
To find me smiling
Like nothing ever happened

You give me some excuse
Like you always do
I just kiss your cheek
And this is
What I tell you (you, you)

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
How many times did
I fall for your lies
How many times
Did I sit home and cry
Never questioning why
Why I

It just came to me
Like an epiphany
How about if I just leave

[Repeat Chorus:]

So I think I'm just about over
Being your girlfriend
I'm leaving
I'm leaving

No more wondering
What you've been doing
Where you been sleeping
(It's over)

I'm leaving (It's over)
I'm leaving (yea, yea, yeah)
I'm leaving (yea, yea, yeah)
