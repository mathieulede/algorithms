[Hook: Pharrell]
You can find me in the streets, even in the drought
My mattress is full, why shouldn't I be out?
Hey buddy, I'm good
(What they tell you?) I'm good
(What they tell you?) I'm good
(What she tell you?) I'm good
(What you see?)
Two hundred dolla jeans with my favorite patch
Pullin up my ride, hell yeah, my rims match
What they tell you? I'm good
(What they tell you?) I'm good
(What they tell you?) I'm good
(What she tell you?) I'm good
(What you see?)

[Verse 1 - Pusha T]
Man I'm killin' it ridin' in that brand new
Swimmin' through the streets lookin' like I'm Shamu
In that big body, with the wet paint
I got some pocket change from selling wet weight
Today is a good day, ice cubes on my chest
Lookin' at my Blackberry, freak hit me on the text
Come and beat it up, I just need a minute
You can carry ya ass, you ain't gotta lay in it
Niggas don't like it when you lookin' good
Hate it when you shinin' through the neighborhood
Brand new ride, niggas know the time
Ho's cut they eyes, we call them samurais
Fly as I could ever be!
A level of success that you could never see
You jealous mane, we in propellers mane
Think about it, ain't shit you can tell us mane

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Malice]
Cruisin' on them 22s got me sittin' pretty
You should hear that engine purr, here kitty kitty
Ride through the city, e'erbody know me
And the sun is out, it's like it's shinin on me
Shoutin out the homies as I breeze by
I'm on cloud 9, and I ain't even high
Told my shorty I'll be back and I ain't even lie
Them VVSs be the best that money can buy
I see you flirtin baby, them jeans is painted on her
Mama lookin right, and I don't even want her
No need to take it personal but that's just how it be
No disrespect to you, I'm just enjoyin me
Finally I'm free, all my dues paid
Them yellow diamonds got the charm like it's Minute Maid
And I'm lookin good, and I'm feelin good
Try and stop my shine, I wish a nigga would
