[Verse 1: Jennifer Hudson]
Are you a man who loves and cherishes and cares for me?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
Are you a guard in a prison, maximum security?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
Do we stay home all the time because you want me to yourself?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
Or am I locked away, out of fear that I'll find someone else?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?

[Chorus]
Well, I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy (worthy)
No, I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry

[Verse 2:]
Is this a relationship fulfilling your needs as well as mine?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
Or is this just my sentence, am I doing time?
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
Ohhhh and if this love, real real love, then I'm staying no doubt
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?
But if I'm just loves prisoner, then I'm busting out!
Is that you? Is that you? Is that you?

[Chorus]
Baby, I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Just because you think I might
Find somebody worthy (Find somebody worthy)
No, I don't like
Living under your spotlight
Maybe if you treat me right
You won't have to worry
