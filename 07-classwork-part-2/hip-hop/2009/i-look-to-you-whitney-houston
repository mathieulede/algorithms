[Intro]
As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I’m lost without a cause
After giving it my all

[Verse 1]
Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I’ve been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

[Chorus]
I look to you[x2]
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong
I look to you[x2]
And when melodies are gone In you I hear a song
I look to you

[Bridge]
About to lose my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door

[Verse 2]
And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm go'n make it
Nothing to do but lift my head

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
My levees are broken
My walls are coming down on me
My rain is falling
Defeat is calling
I need you to set me free
Take me far away from the battle
I need you
Shine on me!

[Chorus]
