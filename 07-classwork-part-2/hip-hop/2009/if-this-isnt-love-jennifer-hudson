[Verse 1]
I'm calling his phone up just to tell him how much
I really love him cause he's everything I want
He listens to me, cares for me
So I truly believe

[Pre-Chorus]
God sent me an angel from above
That's gonna love me for life
Might as well be perfect
Only because it's the only way
I can describe, so

[Chorus:]
If this isn't love
Tell me what it is
Cause I could be dreaming and just plain crazy
If this isn't love
Tell me what it is
Cause I never felt like this baby
If this isn't love
L-o-v-e, what is it to me?
L-o-v-e, Oh if this isn't love
L-o-v-e, what is it to me?
L-o-v-e, Oh if this isn't love

[Verse 2:]
I'm selfish cause I don't wanna share him with nobody
Not even those people that came before me
But see, I never believe

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Bridge]
So if you got real love
Let me see you put your hands up
See you put your hands up
The kind of love that fits tight like a glove
Let me see you put your hands up
See you put your hands up
If this isn't love
Cause I know I ain't crazy, I know I ain't trippin'
I know I ain't sleeping, I know that it's love
See me with my hands up
If you think I'm dreaming, I know I ain't dreaming
Cause this reason maybe and I know what is love
If this isn't love...

[Chorus]
