This world has up and gone crazy
I'm out here working trying to make it
Girl, it's so rough in this city
There ain't no resting for the weary
So baby feel me, I need something to feel
So my spirit can heal, babe

I need you to wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
So when I come home tonight, you'll make everything alright
When you gon' wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
The memory of my day will quickly just fade away
When you come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
Please baby, wrap them chocolate legs 'round me

Your cocoa skin against mine, babe
Is all I need to help revive me
Just touch me and I feel pure, pure love
You're the only thing I'm ever sure of, your love I'm sure of
I need some reminding that God is still, He's still behind me
So baby, come take my soul and set me free

When you come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
So when I come home tonight, you'll make everything alright
When you come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
I need you to understand and make me glad I'm a man
Deep inside you that's where I need to be
Oh baby, just wrap them chocolate legs 'round me

Hold on, hold on
I only need you to wrap 'round me
Hold on, hold on
Don't let go, baby, don't let go
Don't you, don't you let go

I need some reminding that God is still, He's still behind me
So baby, just take my soul and set me free
I want you to know how much you mean to me
When you come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me
Oh, oh, tonight, I want you to make things right
Baby, come wrap them chocolate legs 'round me

I need you to understand and make me glad I'm a man
