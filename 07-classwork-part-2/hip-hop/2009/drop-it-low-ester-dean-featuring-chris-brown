[Verse 1: Ester Dean]
This is for boss bitches, for money makin' bitches
All my ladies, throw your hands in the air
I got Patron in my cup and I don't give a fuck
The baddest bitch in the club right here
They wanna see me drop it, drop it, drop it
Wanna pop it, pop it, pop it, shake that ass on the floor
You wanna see me shake it, shake it, shake it
Yeah, you like it, like it, like it when I drop it real low

[Pre-Hook: Ester Dean]
Yeah boy, you like that
I can tell that you like that
Yeah boy, you love it when my booty goes
Boom, ba-ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, boom

[Hook: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
He told me move that thang around and move that thang around
And move that thang around and move that thang around
He said move that thang around and move that thang around
And move that thang around and move that thang around

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I can't stop staring at your body
Put my hands on your body, you sexy fo' sho'
You the real deal kinda hotty
Come and ride in my Bugatti, girl, come drop it low

[Pre-Hook: Chris Brown]
Yeah girl, I like that
You can tell that I like that
Yeah girl, I love when your booty goes
Boom, ba-ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, boom

[Hook: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
He told me move that thang around and move that thang around
And move that thang around and move that thang around
He said move that thang around and move that thang around
And move that thang around and move that thang around

[Bridge: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
He say he like the way my booty, booty, booty pop
He say he like the way my booty, booty booty rock

[Hook: Ester Dean & Chris Brown]
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
And I told her move that thang around and move that thang around
And move that thang around and move that thang around
He said move that thang around and move that thang around
And move that thang around and move that thang around

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Drop it low girl, drop drop it low girl
Drop it low girl, drop it, drop it low girl
