This is dedicated to
This, this, this is dedicated to
Mmm, well, if your feeling like I'm feeling
Then this is dedicated to you

Well, I've been the super girlfriend
Let you think that nothing bother me
Like when you go out with your friends
And people bring me back the stories

The stories 'bout them other girls
'Bout this one and that one and those three
So when I ask a simple question
(Where were you last night?)
You wanna yell and scream and try to flip it on me

No, no, no
(No, no)
Is anybody else just fed up?
If you heard it all befo', fo', fo'
(Fo', fo')
Then right where you are just get up

Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore

'Cause I've dried my eyes and I realized
I deserve somebody that'll treat me right

Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Somebody say, I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore

Because I know my word so you can keep
That drama, I don't want it anymore
Ooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore

Mmm, no more settling for less
I'm looking for that kind of man
That's gonna give his best
'Cause I'm giving my best

A man that wants to cherish this
And knows exactly how to woo me
Not some silly little boy
Who wants my goodies
'Cause he took me to the movies

No, no, no
(No, no)
Is anybody else just fed up?
If you heard it all befo', fo', fo'
(Fo', fo')
Then right where you are just get up

Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore

'Cause I've dried my eyes and I realized
I deserve somebody that'll treat me right
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore

Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Because I know my word so you can keep
That drama, I don't want it anymore

Ooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
Ooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
(Walking out the door)
Ooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
(No, not anymore)
Ooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore

Ooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
Ooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
Ooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
(Not no more, not no more, I'm gone)
Ooh, oh, oh oh
(No)

This is dedicated to
(Better believe in a day)
This, this, this is dedicated to
(Wipe the tears from my face)
Mmm, well, if you feeling like I'm feeling
(If you feel me say)
Then this is dedicated to you

Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore

'Cause I've dried my eyes when I realized
I deserve somebody that'll treat me right
Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore

Somebody say I don't want it anymore
I don't want it anymore
Because I know my word so you can keep
That drama, I don't want it anymore
Ooh, oh, oh oh, not anymore
