[Intro]
Man I got that swag
My hat matches my bag
You know I'm popping tags
Cause man I got that swag

[Refrain]
I'm on Hypnotic, exotic
This Polo on my body
Got a bad girl beside me
And her friend right behind me
And I'm swagging, I'm surfing
I'm swagging, I'm surfing
I'm swagging, I'm surfing
I'm clean like dish detergent
On Patron, yeah I'm gone
Purple by the zone, yeah I'm smoking strong
And you know I'm gone
Cause I'm swagging, I'm surfing
I'm swagging, I'm surfing
I'm swagging, I'm surfing
I'm clean like dish detergent

[Verse 1: Jit]
Okay I pop off in the club with a pocket full of bands
Big stupid fresh like I'm wrapped up in Saran
Swag super cool, blowing strong like a fan
And my chain shining hard it just gave my neck a tan
Pockets on Popeye cause they swoll of that spinach
Peachtree swag you can call me Mr. Lenox
Bottles in my hand, putting on just like cable
Surfing on the scene like a young Kelly Slater
I swag when I surf now watch me surf and swag

[Bridge x2]
I swag when I surf
I swag when I surf
I swag when I surf
Now watch me surf and swag

[Verse 2: Vee]
Swagging in the club, you gon' see me throwing money up
Catch me with a bad chick and all her friends as fine as her
Drinks, we gon' pour them up
Exotic, what we rolling up
Patron, Goose, or Hennessy
They got it, I'mma drank it up
I'm always wearing Polo
Nigga I'm Ralph Lauren mascot
Cake on debit I don't hesitate to cash out
I spend it all
Paint John Stephenson, the black and blue Jag out
Pockets on half-time, I'm always bringing bands out

[Refrain]

[Verse 3: Myko]
When I hit the club, it's like I gotta catch a wave
Boogie-board shawty, got me surfing off the stage
Purp' got me geeked, smoking something like an Eddie Bauer
And I'm surfing like I'm Otto cause I got that Rocket Power
Gon' on Patron, taking shots like a camera
Flat screen, shawty, man I'm surfing like a channel
Paper towel money, man I'm all about my count
And I'm screaming cowabunga while y'all boys wiping out

[Verse 4: Mook]
Polo on my body with a Zach Moore swag
Yea Purple Label man go and check the tags
Went and got the shoes so you know I got the bag
Clean just like dish detergent with a Tide color swag
Chain swinging hard like a boxer throwing punches
Pappadeaux shawty, all on them sack lunches
I'm in the party surfing like I'm standing on a wave
Shawty check my dougie like she Patty Mayonnaise
