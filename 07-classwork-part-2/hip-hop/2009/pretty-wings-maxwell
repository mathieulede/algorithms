[Verse 1:]
Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day they'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have foreva
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same

Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

[Hook:]
If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your prettywings around
Prettywings, your prettywings
Your prettywings around

[Verse 2:]
I came wrong you were right
Transformed your love into light
Baby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies

I turned day into night
Sleep till I died a thousand times
I shoulda showed you
Better night better times better days
And I miss you more, and more

[Hook:]
If I can't have you, let love set you free
To fly your prettywings around
Prettywings, your prettywings
Your prettywings around
