She so sexy, the way she talks, the way she walks
It really drives me crazy, I think I like you girl
Enjoys the moment, and takes her time, and does it right
Cause she not just the average, I really like you girl

And something about her lips, the way she kiss
The way she rocks them hips yo
I see I like you, sure do, Oh then she'll look, and it's so sweet
It knocks me right up off my feet, now baby, I see I like ya suga

Oh, Girl I'll never give you up
Cause ain't no other good enough
And nothing can compare to you
I waited all my life to be with you

Oh oh oh , here I stand and when I fall (When I fall)
Only you'll come back for more
Greatest love I'll ever see
And girl your love just can't be beat!

Girl you, got me, thinking, bout you, everyday
I'm not complaing, nooo
I wanna say, her touch, her smile, keeps me, livin right
I gotta say, she's the best for me
(I guess I tried and tried), to hide the way I feel
I can't explain it, (can't explain it)
It's just too damn good
So I can tell the world, you got my heart
I love your mind design

Oh, Girl I'll never give you up
Cause ain't no other good enough
And nothing can compare to you
I waited all my life to be with you

Oh, here I stand and when I fall
Only you expect for more
Everything she does is sweet
She knocks me off my feet, that Girl

I'd like to invite Mr. Steve Wonder, to my album
Come on Stevie?

(Harmonica Solo)

Oh, Girl I'll never give you up
Cause ain't no other good enough
And nothing can compare to you
I waited all my life to be with you

Oh, here I stand and when I fall
Only you expect for more
Your love is so unique
It knocks me off my feet

Oh, Girl I'll never give you up
Cause ain't no other good enough
And nothing can compare to you
I waited all my life to be with you

Oh, here I stand and when I fall
Only you expect for more
Your love is so unique
It knocks me off my feet

Your love is so damn divine
You're always on my mind

Oh, Girl I'll never give you up
Cause ain't no other good enough
And nothing can compare to you
I waited all my life to be with you
