Something strange came over me
'Cause I never felt this way
There's no place I'd rather be
Than here with you to stay

Can't explain what your love has done for me
(Love has done for me)
Keeps me warm and satisfied
Ooh, you make me see

Sweet

A fantasy

Love vibration

Though my feet are on the ground
My mind is in the sky
Such a thrill, this ecstasy
And you're the reason why

I'm all aglow, love light shinin' through
(Love light shinin')
Ha, thank you, baby
I owe it all to you

And I just wanna let you know
(Just wanna let, wanna let you know)
That I'll never let you go
(I'll never let)
Yeah
(Let you go)

Makes me feel so good inside
To know that I've got you
It's like a dream but when I wake
I find out that it's true
