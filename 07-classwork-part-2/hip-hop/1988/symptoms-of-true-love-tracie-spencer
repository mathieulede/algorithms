[Verse 1:]
Hey, how did you make it
Make me go out of my mind?
Poisoned arrows
Burning fever
Strings in my heart

Now my pulse is racing
Temperature is rising high
Poisoned arrows
Burning fever
Strings in my heart

[Chorus:]
Symptoms of true love
Take my breath away
Make me shake
I cannot get enough
Of your kisses, babe
Tender touch

The symptoms of true love
Put me on my knees
Night and day
I'm ready for takeoff
Come and fly with me
Don't delay

The symptoms of true love
Take my breath away
Make me shake

I cannot get enough
Of your kisses, babe
Tender touch
The symptoms of true love

[Verse 2:]
I know what the cure is
Know what thing to take away
All the headache
All the heartache
All of my pain

Give me all your loving
Care for me all night and day
Do it quickly
And I will be in recovery

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Symptoms of true love
Take my breath away
Make me shake

Cannot get enough
Of your kisses, babe
Tender touch

[Repeat Chorus:]

The symptoms of true love
Oh, put me on my knees

Take my breath away
Oh, baby
Oh, darling

Take my breath away
