[Verse 1:]
Tonight it's been a year
We met each other here
Here I am all alone
As thoughts of you go on

[Hook:]
Hear me crying out to you
You said
Never, never
Would I leave

Here's a tear
From me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

[Chorus:]
I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart

You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

[Verse 2:]
In a dream you are here
You smile and hold me near
And in my heart
I'll pretend
That you are here again

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

Give me one more chance
To make it real
