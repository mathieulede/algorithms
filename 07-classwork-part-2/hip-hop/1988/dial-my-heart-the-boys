I want you here
I wanna put my arms around you
And feel you, dear

You have touched my heart
I'm so in love
You're the only girl I'm thinking of, ooh

I call my baby on the phone
Got to leave a message
Just to let her know
That if she ever feels alone
To dial my heart

And if by chance you're not at home
You can reach me, baby
By the nearest pay phone
I gotta cross my fingers
And pray you'll know to dial my heart

Dial my heart
Just dial my heart
Yeah, yeah

Do you have the time?
I said am I the only homeboy
That's on your mind, woo

Cause I'm alone
And I can't sleep at night
And I won't sleep
Until you're by my side, yeah

To dial my heart

I gotta cross my fingers
And pray you'll know to dial my heart
