What a joy to discover
A feeling, so real and new
Since you came into my life
A dream came true
I'm so in love with you

That I've got to tell you
Something that you should know
Got to let my feelings show
That my love for you has grown, boy
To a place I've never known
All my fears swept away
There's nothing more to say

Let me take you down
To a place where love is found
The joy you bring
Is a song I sing
And I want to sing to you, boy
Let me take you down
To a place where love is found
The joy will be me

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Once friends and now we're lovers
My feelings allow me to show
Especially to you
A love so deep within my soul
I'm truly glad I found
A way to reveal
What I feel
This love is so perfect

Let me take you down
To a place where love is found
The joy you bring
Is a song I sing
And I want to sing to you, boy
Let me take you down
To a place where love is found
The joy will be me

Let me take you down
To a place where love is found
The joy you bring
Is a song I sing
And I want to sing to you, boy... oh

Joy will be me
Oh baby, Oh! Oh! Oh!
See I don't wanna
I don't want to
Lose this love
Because you do it to me
To me, to me
Yeah, yeah
Let me take you down
To a place where love is found
