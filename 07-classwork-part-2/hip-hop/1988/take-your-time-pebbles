[Verse 1:]
You want it
You need it
But you don't understand
And sometimes it hurt you
When things don't go as plan

[Chorus:]
Take your time
To get it
Ooh, baby
Take your time
To get it
But you can never give up

Take your time
To get it
Oh, it hurts a little
Take your time
To get it
I know you'll never give up

[Verse 2:]
Don't ever surrender
You've got to take the chance
You've got to stay hungry
To be the best you can
Oh, baby

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Take your time

[Bridge:]
I know that you win
Shine your way back through
Just hold on
You better get ready
When all your dreams come true

[Chorus:]
Take your time
To get it
Ooh, baby
Take your time
To get it
But you can never give up

Take your time
To get it
Oh, it hurts a little
Take your time
To get it
I know you'll never give up

Don't let anybody tell you it's impossible
Don't let anybody tell you it's impossible

Take your time
To get it
Baby
Take your time
To get it
Oh, it hurts a little

Take your time
To get it
Take your time
To get it
Take your time
To get it
Take your time
To get it

Take your time
To get it
Take your time
To get it
Take your time
To get it

If you want it
If you need it
So you gotta have it
You better take that time

If you want it
If you need it
So you gotta have it
Baby, you gotta take your time

Take your time
To get it
Take your time
To get it
Take your time
To get it
