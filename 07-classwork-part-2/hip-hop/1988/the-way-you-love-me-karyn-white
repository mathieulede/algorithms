[Verse 1]
Hey, baby
You're driving me crazy
With that special loving feeling that you give to me
And I'm so proud, you want me to be your lady
Now I know how it feels to live a fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to dream about love
And sure that's how it was
But I don't have to dream no more
'Cause I, I got more than I can stand
I found me a lover in another man
I got you, baby, that's all I was waiting for

[Chorus]
And I love the way you love me
I place no one above the one true love
I love (And I love)
The way you love me
And baby no matter what
I love the, I love the way you love
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh)

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, baby, baby
I might as well face it
I've fallen in too deep
You have control of me
Without a doubt
It has to be the greatest
You're every bit the man I had hoped you'd be

[Pre-Chorus]
I used to dream about love
And sure that's how it was
But I don't have to dream no more
Oh, no
'Cause when I think about your loving, that I good thing
I get excited from the feeling that it's giving to me
So won't you keep it coming, baby?
'Cause I love the joy you bring
I, oh, oh, I love

[Chorus]
And I love
The way you love me
(I love it, love it, love it, love it)
I place no one above (Yeah)
The one true love (Yeah)
Yeah
I love (And I love)
The way you love me
And baby no matter what
I love the, I love the way you love
(Oh oh)

So don't you stop
