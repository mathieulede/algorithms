[Verse 1]
I was a lonely no one
Living in a vacuum as life's debris
Victimized as one whose self deprivation
Had made for my outer insecurity
I was a he ain't nothin'
Living in the slums of love's misery
Starving from the lack of sweet affection
Until you came to rescue me

[Chorus]
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Since you walk through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through

[Verse 2]
I was a Mr. Lonely
Seeing only darkness in the bright of day
Blind even though my eyes were wide opened
But then your love sunshined my way

[Chorus]
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Since you walk through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry [x6]

[Verse 3]
My life was without reason
Sinking in a hell that had no space or time
Falling to the burning pit of pain and sorrow
Until you saved this life of mine

[Chorus]
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Since you walk through my door
I don't have to no longer be blue
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
Now that love's touched my soul
All my lonely nights alone are through
I don't cry, baby baby I don't cry [x4]
My eyes don't cry no more
My heart don't ache no more
My nights are not lonely no more
My tears don't flow no more
My eyes don't cry, my eyes don't cry, my eyes don't cry no more
