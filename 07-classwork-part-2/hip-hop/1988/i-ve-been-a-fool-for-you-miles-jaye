Oh yeah, hey baby, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, that's right

We had a chance to find true love
And make it last forever
From the first dance
I knew it was just you and I, together

What made you try those childish games?
What made you want to use me?
So now today, we're not the same
And you're about to lose me

Baby, I've been a fool for you
You made me go round and round
I've been a fool for you
But it's over now, it's over now, yeah

You stood me up and you put me down
In front of all our best friends, yeah
You seem to love to show yourself
In front of all the other men, yeah, yeah

You tell the girls that I don't mind
And you've got such a good thing
But one day soon, you're gonna find, yeah
This fool of yours is missing

Baby, I've been a fool for you, oh
You made me go round and round
Yeah, I've been a fool for you
But it's over now, it's over now

I've been a fool for you
You made me go round and round
I've been a fool for you
But it's over now, it's over now, yeah

Yeah, why did you put me down?
Why did you mess around?
Yeah, I want to know

What made you try those childish games?
What made you want to use me?
See now today, we're not the same, girl
And you're about to lose me

Baby, I've been a fool for you
Been a fool, girl
You made me go round and round, yeah
I've been a fool for you
But it's over now, it's over now
It's over now, it's over now, girl

Baby, I've, oh, been a fool for you
I've been a fool for you, baby
You made me go round and round
Say, I've been a fool for you
But it's over now, it's over now
It's over now, yeah

Baby, I've been a fool for you, you, girl
You made me go round and round
What're you doing?
Oh, I've been a fool for you
But it's over now, it's over
It's over, yeah, over, oh

I've been a fool for you
Why did you put me down, girl?
You made me go round and round
Say, I, I've been a fool for you

I've been a fool
I was a fool for you, girl
Oh, I've been a fool
