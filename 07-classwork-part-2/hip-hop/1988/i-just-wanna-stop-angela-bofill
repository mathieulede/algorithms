When I think about
Those nights in Montr√©al
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me
Memories of love
Above the city lights

Oh, I've tried so hard to take it
But I know my heart won't make it
And tell you what I feel about you, babe

I just wanna stop
And I never wanna live without you, babe
I just gotta stop for your love
(For your love)
For your love
(For your love)

When I think about the way
The world must turn
(The world must turn)
I get the saddest thoughts
For you and me
(You and me)
Memories of life and times go on and on

Oh, I've tried hard to forget it
But I know my mind won't let it
And tell you what I feel about you, babe
The world ain't right without you, babe
I just gotta stop for your love

Oh, I've tried so hard to take it
But I know my heart won't make it
I just wanna stop and tell you
What I feel about you, babe
The world ain't right without you, babe
For your love

Stop
Woo, woo, woo
I just wanna stop
Woo, woo, woo

I just wanna stop and tell you
What I feel about you, babe
The world ain't right without you, babe

I just wanna stop
Woo, woo, woo
