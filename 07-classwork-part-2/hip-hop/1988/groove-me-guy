Groove me...baby...tonight!

[Verse 1:]
When I get you home tonight
Then it's gonna be alright
Girl, just you and I
Hey let's recognize true love
Hey girl, are you in a romantic mood?
Sing, ooh, won't you groove me?

[Chorus:]
Groove me, baby, tonight
Groove me, baby, tonight

[Verse 2:]
Even if it's for a while
Enjoy this good loving with a smile
We'll go out tonight
Have a little part of paradise
We'll go out tonight
Baby, having dinner 'round the candle light
Then you can groove me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Don't tease me with your maybe's, girl
Tell me you are in my world
And you'll never leave
Girl don't make me plead with you
I need your love, only you, my love
Singing, ohh, groove me, baby

[Chorus] (2x)

Groove me, baby
Tonight tonight right now baby
That's what I want you to do
I want you to Groove Me tonight
Don't say no, don't say maybe
Groove me, baby now! Yeah

Hold up! Hold up! It ain't over!
(I thought y'all didn't like the beat!?)
It's not over! The party's not over!

Funky...

Hold up! Hold up! It ain't over!
(I thought y'all didn't like the beat!?)
It's not over! The party's not over!

Teddy! You Did!
