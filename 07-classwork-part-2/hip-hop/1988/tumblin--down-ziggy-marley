Here comes the eagle
Here comes the bear
And they're fighting to control
The lions' dominion
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come
Here comes synthetic food
And their big money
And they want to control
Our body and soul
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come
Here comes the maker
To crush the oppressor
And I bet you didn't know
It was a mind over matter
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come
Here comes the eagle like a chicken
Here comes the bear [Incomprehensible]
And they're fighting to control
The lions' dominion, not today or tomorrow
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come tumblin' down
Load gonna come
