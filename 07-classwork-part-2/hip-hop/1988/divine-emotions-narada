Oh
Little baby
Sweet darling
- he's calling
He's calling -
I wanna tell you
Oh
I seem to be falling
- he's calling and falling -
Yes
I do
- He's more than curious
He really needs the stuff -
I look at you and I go boing-boing-boing
- He hasn't lost his touch
A word can mean so much -
It's more than just a passing fancy
Divine emotions come over me when you smile
- Oh
When you smile
Baby -
A higher notion of ecstatsy drives me wild
- Drive me wild
Drive me wild -
Oh
I'm drowning this time
- he's sinking
He's sinking -
Since I got the taste of
Oh
Your lips on my mind
- he's sinking and thinking -
Hahahahaha!
- She thinks the boy is nuts
Somebody she can trust -
I try to speak and I go ding-dong-ding
- He makes it sound so nice
The girl's not made of ice -
Toto
Look I think she's melting
Divine emotions come over me when you smile
...
Divine emotions come over me when you smile
- I love the way you love me -
A higher notion of ecstasy drives me wild
- Come on
Dear baby
Dear baby -
Divine emotions
Divine emotions
Divine emotions come over me when you smile
