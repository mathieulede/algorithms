[Chorus:]
Gotta know, baby
He's got the look, baby
I want to know
He's got the look, baby
Just got to know

[Verse 1:]
One sleepless night
No end in sight
Went out to have some fun
Rocked till morning light

To my surprise
He caught my eye, yeah
My heart skipped a beat
What's happening to me

[Chorus:]
He's got the look, baby
I want to know
So fine (word)
Almost a crime
He's got the look, baby

Just got to know
Anytime (get with it)
Gonna make him mine

[Verse 2:]
He came to me
Said, "Do you like what you see?"
No time for acting shy
Love's got a hold on me

His classy style
That sexy smile
Right then and there I knew
He was the one for me
Hey

Night dancing
(Hold me closer)
Romancing
(Aw, baby)
Sweet love in your eyes

Together
Forever
That's how it will be

[Chorus:]
He's got the look, baby
I want to know
Oh yeah
When you move, I like what you do
He's got he look

Baby, just got to know
Oh, yeah
My heart skipped a beat, baby
I like what I see
