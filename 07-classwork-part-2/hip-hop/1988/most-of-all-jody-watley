You made a promise
That you'd never desert me
So where are you now
You built me up
Then you left me standing all alone
Lost in the crowd

My friends all say to forget you
I should but why do I hurt so

No one wins when the love is lost
You turned your back on me
When I needed you most of all
No one wins when love takes a fall
How could you let me down
I needed you most of all

Maybe I should learn to live life without you
Find someone new
But something happens deep inside when our eyes meet
I know you feel it too

Don't try and say you're happy without me
Don't say you don't miss my love, boy

No one wins when the love is lost
You turned your back on me
When I needed you most of all
No one wins when love takes a fall
How could you let me down
I needed you most of all

Maybe we can find a way
To bring back all the yesterdays
Maybe we can find the path
It's not too late to save the love
Save the love we had

Most of all

No one wins when the love is lost
You turned your back on me
When I needed you most of all
No one wins when love takes a fall
How could you let me down
I needed you most of all
