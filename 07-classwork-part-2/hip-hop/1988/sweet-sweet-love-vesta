[Verse 1:]
I remember I was scared
Love especially
Fell in love with you
Stole my heart in such a way
Watcha did to me
Can't explain

[Pre-Chorus:]
(How you kiss me) how you kiss me
(When you kiss me) kiss me
(Feel so good) Baby it feels soooooo good aww
(How you hold me) Hold me babe
(When you hold me) Hold me
(Love so good) Love so good
Well there are so many ways (so many things I do)
I gotta make me feel just with your

[Chorus:]
Sweet sweet love (I love you, yes I do)
Sweet sweet love (Wanna spend my life with you)
Sweet sweet love (I need you everyday)
Sweet sweet love (You're in my heart to stay)
Sweet sweet love

[Verse 3:]
Love is wrong in many ways
Stood the test of time
Stronger everyday
No one loves me like you do
I found in you love so true
(How you touch me)
Touch me babe
(When you touch me)
Touch me
(Feel so good)
Ohhhh it feels soooo good oh
