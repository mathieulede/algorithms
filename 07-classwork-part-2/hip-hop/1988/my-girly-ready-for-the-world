Hello lover your the girl I used to know
With a pretty face
I've seen you drawn in so many ways
Can't help but tell you how much you changed
Cosmetics and all
It's so hard to believe you were once my girl
Oh yeah
Ceramic girl you know you're so fine
Ceramic girl don't try and blow my mind
Ceramic girl..oh yeah
So nonchalant laid back and ready for the world
So much make-up but you were once my girl

But i know you do it just for the boys...oh yeah
Ceramic girl you know you're so tight

I don't know what it is that makes you wander out
Cause the only thing that matters is what you got inside
So don't go and put on a show for other guys
Break out the strdyx and let's go for a ride
Hey yeah...oooh
I've seen you so many times before
And everytime I see you, you make me want you more
You stay at home and hate yourself all day
It doesn't really matter, cause I loved you anyway sing it!
