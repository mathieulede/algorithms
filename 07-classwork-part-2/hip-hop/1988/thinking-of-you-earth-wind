Thinking of you
What would I do
I'll be true
I'm thinking of you

Not to say that I'm a matchmaker
When it comes to you
You met your match

You're inclined to
Leave me fascinated
By the things you do
My baby dance, oh yeah

You can bet your bottom dollar
Honey, I will be with you
Through thick and thin, oh yeah
I would love to give a testimony
'Bout the way you are
You're my best friend

I've been thinking
(Thinking of you)
Got me wondering
(What would I do)
Got me thinking
(I'll be true)
Got me wondering
(I'm thinking of you)

You're the one that
Makes my love light shine
Every time, morning till night

With the sentimental way you show
The kind of love
Makes it all right, yeah

What you give is extraordinary
It's a way of life I like to live
I could be with you forever
'Cause lovin' gives me a thrill

Girl, I appreciate
The love we generate
You keep me satisfied
Just the sun that shines
Deep in this heart of mine
Your love shining through
