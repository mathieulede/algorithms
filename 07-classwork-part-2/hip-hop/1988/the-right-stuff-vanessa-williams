[Verse 1:]
I was standing at 7:15
Waiting for my baby's car
Just then out stepped
The driver of a limousine
And asked if I was going far

I said I've got my mind made up
I don't wanna leave him, baby
'Cause it's clear to me
That it's just to tough to
Find another lover like mine

[Chorus:]
With the right stuff
The right stuff, baby
I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
Ooh, no
With Mr. Right

[Verse 2:]
Just Friday 'bout a week ago
This fellow called me on the phone
And said, "I live in Paris
Don't you want to go
I know you must be all alone"

Well, it'll take more than a fancy trip
Or a chauffeured limousine
'Cause I ain't never seen no one
Who could give me love like this
The other fellows don't compare

[Chorus:]
To the right stuff
The right stuff, baby
I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
Ooh, no
With Mr. Right
Sing

[Bridge:]
He's the only to give me that loving
'Cause next to him
There is no other one
He's very sexy and oh so sweet
And he knocks me off my feet
Say it

[Chorus:]
I need the right stuff
I got to have the right stuff
I don't wanna miss out on the right stuff
