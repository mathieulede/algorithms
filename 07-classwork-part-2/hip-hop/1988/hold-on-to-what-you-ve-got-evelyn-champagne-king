I like taking chances
Especially when it comes to love
But L-O-V-E
Is not the the kind of word I speak lightly of

It's so romantic
The reflection of the moon on a Carribbean cruise
But there's another reflection
I see against the water:
Another man in your shoes

I know you'll find a saying like
Handsome whirlwind
He's the reason I believe
Money can't buy me love

And since money is your top priority
I suggest you hold on
To what you've got
If I had it I know just who I would spend it on

Hold on
To what you've got
'cause I'll be holding on to love
Ooh

You shouldn't have no problem
With women, there are those out there
Who would love to play your game
Just for the fun of it
But I don't care

I'm your secretary on the job
I hope that never ends
We may have to see each other
So if we can't be lovers
We can still be friends

Business, people, pleasure
Should be on your mind, boy
When it comes to loving me
You're wasting your time

Better give your love
To who's loving you
So they can be hugging you

Hold on
To what you've got
Now I know I've got somebody
Who is good this time

Better hold on
To what you've got
'cause I'll be holding on to love
Better hold on

I really love my work
But you're getting bold
And that's something
You fail to realize

But if you keep it up
I'll have to take control
'Cause you can't put a
Swift, good loving on hold

No no no
It just won't go
No no no

You're wasting your time

Better give your love
To who's loving you
So they can be hugging you

Hold on
To what you've got
Now I know I've got somebody
Who is good this time

Better hold on
To what you've got
'cause I'll be holding on to love

Hold on
To what you've got
Now I know I've got somebody
Who is good this time
