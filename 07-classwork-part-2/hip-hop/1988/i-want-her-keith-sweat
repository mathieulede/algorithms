[Verse 1]
Seen you last night, saw you standing there
And couldn't picture the color of your hair
And all I wanted to know, were you really there?

I wanna know, was it my imagination
Ooh, you know it was a sweet sensation
Looking at you from a distance
Ooh, it seems so real

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I together
Dream that seemed for real
If it's a dream, please don't wake me up
It feels so real, all I know is

[Chorus]
I want her
(I want that baby)
I want her
(Get it, get it, get it, get it)
I want her
(I wanna do it like this, do it like that)
I want her
(Once I get it, ain't no turning back)

[Verse 2]
You turn me on and on
This feeling, girl, is so strong
My heart, girl, is on fire
Ooh, you're my desire

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I've got a thing for you
Dreams of you and me, baby
She's bad, she's bad, she's bad
All I know is

[Chorus]
I want her
(I want, I want, I want, I want, I want her)
I want her
(Don't misunderstand me)
I want her
(I wish this dream was for real)
I want her
(You, you know the deal)
I want her
(Yeah, yeah)
I want her
(I want that girl so bad)
I want her
(I had a dream of her last night)
I want her
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Break (w/ Trumpet Solo)]

And I, I
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, ooh, baby
All night long, girl

[Chorus x4 (w/ ad-libs)]

[Break]

[Chorus x2 (w/ ad-libs)]
