[Intro]
Sorry
Ooh, yeah (You’re very pretty)
*stutter* Sorry
Woo, ooh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Ralph Tresvant]
Oh, girl, I know that you're attracted to me
And I should feel the same about you
But there's something wrong
I don't know what it is
That keeps us from becoming a two

[Pre-Chorus: Ralph & (Johnny Gill)
It's not your looks (You're very pretty)
It's not your style (The way you dress is oh so fresh)
It's not the way that you carry yourself

[Chorus: Ralph & (New Edition)]
Oh, girl, I'm (sorry)
You're not my (kind of girl)
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man's dreams are made of
Oh, girl, I'm (sorry)
You're not my (kind of girl)
‘Cause you're the kind of girl that a man would be proud to call his own

[Verse 2: Ralph]
Girl, you're so pretty
I wouldn't change a thing about you
But I've been in love before
So I know how it feels
The chemistry just isn't there

[Pre-Chorus: Ralph & (Johnny Gill)
It's not your looks (You're very pretty)
It's not your style (The way you dress is oh so fresh)
It's not the way that you carry yourself

[Chorus 2X]

[Breakdown: Ronnie DeVoe]
(Michael Bivins: Man, I don’t know what’s wrong with that brother)
You know what I’m saying, Mike?
On the serious tip, I think the girl is pretty fly
(Ricky Bell: You too, Ron?) Yeah
(Ricky Bell: I think he’s just buggin’, man)
Yo, if I had it, I know what I’d do with it?
But if you had it, what would you do?

[Ricky Bell & (New Edition)]
(Oh, girl, I’m sorry)
I’m not tryna put you down (Kind of girl)
But you’re just not that girl
(Oh, girl, I’m sorry)
And even though you’re not my kind (Kind of girl)
You’re still so fine
Oh, girl, I’m sorry
