Got a one room apartment
To a little tiny space
Isn't much, but keeps the rain drops
Off my pretty baby's face
I'm just gettin' by
And the money's spent
Don't even know how I'm gonna pay the monthly rent
But I know exactly what I wanna do
I wanna make this work with you

(Bridge 1)
I know you're wonderin' what I mean
Nothing in life is guaranteed
I never know just were I'm going, lady
I need direction in my life

(Chorus)
Nah, nah, nah
No guarantee
Nah, nah, nah
No guarantee

While I was out window gazin'
I put your coat on layaway
You know I wanna buy you diamonds
Soon as they increase my pay
Startin' from down it's hard to kept your head
Makin' love every night on a squeaky bed
That's right that's the way it is
There's no guarantee

(Bridge 2)
I know you're wonderin' what I mean
Nothing in life is guaranteed
I never know just were I'm going, lady
I need direction in my life
Then anything you wanna do baby
You know I'll be down for you lady
So let's just keep it strong...

(Chorus)
Keep it strong
We gotta keep pushin' on
Keep it strong
We gotta keep pushin on
And on

(Bridge 2)

(Chorus)

(Ad libs with chorus until end)
