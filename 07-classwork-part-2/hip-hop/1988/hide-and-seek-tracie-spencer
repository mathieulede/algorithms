Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah
Whoa, mmm

[Verse 1:]
Are you hiding from me?
Playing a game of hide and seek
I count to ten
Then you hide again from me

Well, I know
You're somewhere in this world
And I want to be your girl
So if you hear this song
Please don't leave me here alone

[Chorus:]
Playing hide and seek
Ready or not
Here I come

Playing hide and seek
Wondering where or when
Will we find each other
Ooh, yeah

I'm looking for you
Where are you hiding?

[Verse 2:]
Now it's so lonely
When you're not in love
Needing to be kissed and hugged
And held real tight
When you go to sleep at night

I can hear you calling out my name
It's such a crazy game
I look around
And you're nowhere to be found

[Repeat Chorus x3:]

[Chorus:]
Playing hide and seek
Ready or not
Here I come

Playing hide and seek
Wondering where or when
Will we find each other
Ooh, baby

I'm looking for you
Where are you hiding?

I need you, baby
Why are you hiding from me
Ooh, ooh

Why are you playing hide and seek
From me, yeah
I run from you
You hide from me
