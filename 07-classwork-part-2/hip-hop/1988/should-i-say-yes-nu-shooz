My friends all tell me
What they think that I should do
So much confusion
When it comes to loving you

So many reasons
Why we should stay apart
My mind tells me one thing
Should I listen to my heart?

Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
Wish I knew you better
Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
Should I say no?

We may be different
But there’s one thing that stays the same
I know I need you
In a way that I can’t explain

So many reasons
Why we should stay apart
My mind tells me one thing
Should I listen to my heart

Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
(I wanna know)
Wish I knew you better
Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
You won’t wait for me forever

Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
Wish we were together
Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
(Whoa, no)
Should I say no?

My mind tells me one thing
When I’m listening to my heart
Will we be together?
(Will we be together?)
Or will we be apart?
Yeah

Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
(Whoa, no)
Wish I knew you better
Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
I’m writing you a letter

Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
(Whoa, baby)
I wish we were together

Should I say yes?
Should I say no?
You won’t wait for me
Forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever and ever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
