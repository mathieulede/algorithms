Feeling your presence
And knowing you're there
I'm looking across the room
Seeing your eyes meet mine

A chill runs up my spine
It's wonderful
Yes, it is
Hoping you'll soon be mine

The stare I can't control
When you smile
Your face all aglow
The way I feel for you is heavenly
Let your feelings show
You warm my soul

I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I want
I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I need

I wanted to be with you
Don't you know that no one else will do
But how can we ignore our needs?
So I'll open up
I'll open my door if you run to me

I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I want
I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I need

A chill runs up my spine
And it drives me wild
Don't tell nobody
Don't want nobody to know

I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I want
I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I need

What you mean to me
I adore you so
You mean the world to me
Can't ever let you go

I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I want
I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I need

I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I want
I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I need

I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I want
I just can't go on being your secret lady
Mystery, baby
You're the one I need
