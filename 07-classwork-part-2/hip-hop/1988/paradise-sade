I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

Feels like
You're mine
Feels right
So fine
I'm yours
You're mine
Like paradise

I'd give you the world if it was mine
Feels fine

I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

Feels like
You're mine
Feels right
So fine
I'm yours
You're mine
Like paradise

Oooh what a life
Oooh what a life
Oooh what a life
Oooh what a life

I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life

Oooh what a life
Like paradise
