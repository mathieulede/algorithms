Mmm, mmm, hmm

[Verse 1:]
I've been trying to tell myself
I don't need you
Trying to hold back the feelings
I feel for you

Knowing in the end
There's no future
For you and I
I can't tell no lie

[Chorus:]
(Baby, be mine)
You never really got to know me
(Baby, be mine)
I should have said it at the time
(Words left unspoken)
They only gave you a token of my love, ooh

[Verse 2:]
Take a second chance
See what you're missing
I'm just somebody you don't know
As well as you think you do
So understand me this time
Baby, be mine

[Repeat Chorus:]

Ooh, ooh, hoo
Ooh
Ooh, hoo
Hey, hey, hey,  hey

[Chorus:]
(Baby, be mine)
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
Come on, come on

(Baby, be mine)
Maybe I should have said it at the time
(Words left unspoken)
They only give you a token of my love
My love

(Baby, be mine)
(Baby, be mine)
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Words left unspoken)
They only game you a token of
My, my, my, my, my love
Hey, hey
Yeah

Come on, you sweet thing
You know I
I need love everyday

No way
(Baby, won't you be mine?)
Oh, come on, boy
Give me just a little bit
Just a little bit
Just a little bit loving, baby

(Baby, won't you be mine?)
Won't you be mine?
Won't you be mine?
Oh, yeah, yeah

Oh, baby
Baby, baby
Baby, be mine

(Words left unspoken)
(They only gave you a token of my love)
You haven't even begun to know me, boy
Oh, ho, ho
Yeah

(Baby, be mine)
Come on and be my love
Say that you will
Say that you will
Say that you will

(Words left unspoken)
(They only gave you a token of my love)
My, my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my, my, my
My, my, my love

(Baby, be mine)
Come on, baby
Say that you love me too
Say that you'll be my forever love
Always together love
(Words left unspoken)
I promise you
