Come into my life, I got so much love to show you
Come into my life, boy I adore you
Come into my life, I got so much love to show you
Come into my life, boy I adore you

Come into my life, I'll open the door
If you come into my life, boy I adore you
And I will treat you right
And I'll show you sweet mellow days that you want and need
For you hold the keys to my life
Good times will flow if you make our love strong and tight
Together as one not two, we'll shine like diamond ice, uh
And I'll show you sweet mellow days that you want and need

Because I can brighten up your days
And when you're feeling bad I'll put a smile on your face
Can you tell me what price must I pay
To make you see things my way
Don't wait, don't wait, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

For you hold the keys to my life
Good times will flow if you make our love strong and tight
Together as one not two, we'll shine like diamond ice, uh
And I'll show you sweet mellow days that you want and need

Because I can brighten up your days
And when you're feeling bad I'll put a smile on your face, hey hey
Can you tell me what price must I pay
To make you see things my way
Don't wait, don't wait
Come to my life, coming down for me
