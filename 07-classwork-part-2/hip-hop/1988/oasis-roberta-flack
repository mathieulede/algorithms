In the morning
When I see the sun
I think about you

February
Cold and cloudy days
Here without you
Oh, oh

I know it won't be long
'Til you're here with me
Waiting with anticipation

Lately
Seems I hear your voice in the distance
Coming closer
Dark and rainy skies disappearing

Oh, oh
Let me hold you close
I know what you need
Give you all my love and affection
Oh

Now I'm laying next to you
We share our hearts beneath the desert moon
Now my love you'll never lose
Now my oasis here in you

Baby
The world is far away
When we're together in my oasis
Kiss my tears away
And we remember
(Now remember)

Oh, oh
Let me hold you close
(Hold you close)
I know what you need
(What you need)
Give you all my love and affection
Oh

Now I'm laying next to you
We share our hearts beneath desert moons
And my love you'll never lose
Now my oasis here in you

Say you'll never leave
(Oasis, oasis)
Oh, no
All that I need
Is to keep you here with me
(Need, need, need, need, oh)
Oh

World is far away
(No stormy weather)
No more cloudy days
No, no
(Found my oasis)
In your loving arms
(I'll leave you never)
Never leave you

Oh, oh
Let me hold you close
(Hold you close)
I know what you need
(What you need)
Give you all my love and affection
Oh

When I'm laying next to you
We share out hearts beneath desert moons
And my love you'll never lose
Now my oasis here in you

Now I'm laying next to you
We share out hearts beneath desert moons
Now my love you'll never lose
Now my oasis here in you

Oh, oh, oh oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh
