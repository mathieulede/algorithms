Feel much like romancing
How'd you like to wine and dine
I'd like to take you dancin'
Candle lights and dinner
(We'll both relax)

We'll dance to sweet music
How about some Marvin Gaye
Feel like some sexual healing
Just relax and let me do, let me do things my way

This is what I do
(I wanna do it)
To get you in the mood
Baby, I'll do it all to get you in the mood
This is what I do to get you in the mood
Baby, I'll do it all to get you in the mood
This is what I do to get you in the mood
(Ooh, ooh)

Let me rub your shoulders
(Just relax)
Just let go
Slip on somethin' sexy
It's all right, baby, let me take control, hoo

Step into the shower
I'll wash your back and you'll wash mine
Please stay for one more hour
I just want to make sweet love to you and feel you one more time

This is what I do
(This is what I do)
To get you in the mood
Baby, I'll do it all to get you in the mood
(I wanna get you in the mood, baby)

This is what I do
(I wanna do it)
To get you in the mood
Baby, I'll do it all to get you in the mood
(Yeah, baby)

This is what I do
(Woo)
To get you in the mood
Baby, I'll do it all to get you in the mood

This is what I do
(I wanna do it)
To get you in the mood
Baby, I'll do it all to get you in the mood
(Ooh, ooh)
Hoo

This is what I do
(I'll do)
To get you in the mood
Baby, I'll do it all to get you in the mood

This is what I do
(I wanna do it)
To get you in the mood
(We could take a shower, give you lovin' by the hour)
Baby, I'll do it all to get you in the mood

This is what I do
(I'll do it just for you, baby)
To get you in the mood
Baby, I'll do it all to get you in the mood
