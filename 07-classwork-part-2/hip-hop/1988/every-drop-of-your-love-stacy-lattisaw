I'm loving everything about you
Baby, can't you tell
Keep opening your heart to me
It's okay if you tripped and fell

In love with me
Just go with the flow and let the seed that planted grow
Don't hesitate
Till we've gone all the way
Heed the word your heart is saying

Let it rock, don't you stop
Till you give me every single drip, drip-drop of your love
(Every drop of it, I want to get enough of it)
Let it rock, don't you stop
Till you give me every single drip, drip-drop of your love
(Every drop of your love) My baby

It's so strong, it should be serious
It's so real, I'm prepared
Withdraw my long life savings
To give you all the love, all the love I've never shared

We're in between
Just one step away from a place called heavenly
Let go, let this dream come true
There's no turning back, let the feeling set the mood
Ooh, hoo, hoo

Let it rock, don't you stop
Till you give me every single drip, drip-drop of your love
(Every drop of it, I want to get enough of it)
Let it rock, don't you stop
Till you give me every single drip, drip-drop of your love
(Every drop of your love) My baby

Let it drop, don't you stop
Till you give me every drip-drop, ooh

We're in between
Just one step away from a place called heavenly
Let go, let this dream come true
There's no turning back, let the feeling set the mood

Let it rock, don't you stop
Till you give me every single drip, drip-drop of your love
(Every drop of it, I want to get enough of it)
Let it rock (Let it), don't you stop (Don't you stop)
Till you give me every single drip, drip-drop of your love
(Every drop of your love) My baby (Oh, baby)

Let it rock (Let it), don't you stop (Don't you stop)
Till you give me every single drip (Ooh), drip-drop ofyour love
(Every drop of it, oh...)
Let it rock (Let it), don't you stop (Don't you stop)
Till you give me every single drip, drip-drop of your love
(Oh...oh...oh...baby) My baby

Let it rock (Let it), don't you stop (Don't you stop)
