It takes two to make a thing go right
I takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
I takes two to make it outta sight
Hit It
I wanna rock right now
I'm Rob Base and I came to get down
I'm not internationally know
But I'm known to rock the microphone
Because I get stupid I mean outrageous
Stay away from me if you're contagious
Cause I'm a winner, no not a loser
To be an MC is what I choosa
Ladies love me, girls adore me
I mean even the ones who never saw me like
The way that I rhyme at a show
The reason why man I don't know so let's go cause
It takes two to make a thing go right
I takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
I takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it
My name is Rob I got a real funky concept
Listen up cause I'm gonna keep you in step
I got an idea, that I wanna share
You don't like it, so what, I don't care
I'm number one, the uno, I like fun
Bring all the suckers cause all them are stunned
Won't neglect, but I won't protect
All of my followers cause all I want is respect
I'm not a boxer, but the man who rocksa
A slick brotha that could easily out fox ya
Cause I'm Rob the last name Base yeah
And on the mic, I'm known to be the freshest
So let's start, it shouldn't be too hard
I'm not a sucker so I don't need a body guard
I won't flex wear a bullet proof vest
Don't smoke buddah, can't stand sex yes
It takes two to make a thing go right
I takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
I takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it
The situation, that the Base is in
I'm kinda stingy that's why I don't wanna win
A funky rhyme to a foe or a good friend
Listen up cause I want you to comprehend
Cause I'm the leader, the man superior
I take care of ya, and then you get wearier
So just sit, my rhymes are like counterfeit
The record sales, which makes this one a hit
It won't hurt, to listen to red alert
Take off your shirt, and so I don't hit the dirt
I like the kids, the guys the girls
I want the dirt cause this is Rob Base world
I'm on a mission, you better just listen
To my rhymes cause I'm all about dissin cause
It takes two to make a thing go right
I takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
I takes two to make it outta sight
Hit it
I stand alone, don't need anyone
Cause I'm Rob just came to have fun
Don't need friends that act like foes
Cause I'm Rob Base, the one who knows about things
That make you get weary, don't cheer me
Just hear me out, cause I got the clout shot ooohhh
Before I turn the party out
I won't start up project my voice
Speak clearly, so you can be my choice
On stage, or on record
Go to the Wiz, and select it
Take it off the rack if it's wack put it back
I like the Rob so #$%* the Big Mac
If you want static, so let's go
So throw up your hands, go for what you know
Bro, I got an ego, yo talkin to me, no oh
Cause Rob is in the front EZ Rock is on the back up
We're not soft so you better just slack up
Cause I'm cool, calm just like a breeze
Rock the mic with the help of EZ Rock
On the set the music play
Only touch the records that I say
It takes two to make a thing go right
I takes two to make it outta sight
It takes two to make a thing go right
I takes two to make it outta sight
All right now, EZ Rock now, when I count to 3 I want you to get busy
You ready now, 1 2 3 get loose now
It takes two to make a
It it it it takes two to make a
It it it it takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
It takes two to make a
