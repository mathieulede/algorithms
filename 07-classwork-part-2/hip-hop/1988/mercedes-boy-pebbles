Baby, let me tell you
I've been watching you
See you dancing in my dreams
Feel you heartbeat inside of me

So if you feel it coming on
Catch me getting in the mood
Boy, I'll give you anything
Cruising's all you have to do

Tell me what you're gonna do with me
Cause if you wanna ride in my Mercedes, boy
There are so many things that
I'm gonna do to you

Baby, let me tell you
