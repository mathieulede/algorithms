That's nice
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Ow

[Verse 1:]
I don't need no dancing partner
I don't need no man in blue
I don't want nobody, baby
Telling my kid just what to do

I don't need no dance instructor
I don't need no learning fade
I don't want no rapper in this song
I don't need no MTV

[Chorus:]
'Till the train pulls up the station
Early in the morning
I'll be dancin' with myself

Dancin,' yeah
I'll be dancin' with myself
Dancin'
(Dancin' with myself)

[Verse 2:]
Don't need to dive into Apollo, no
I don't need to sniff cocaine
I don't want combustion interruptions

You're selling me cures from the pain
Don't need a hype and propaganda
False topics
Leading me astray

I just want to live my life
The way I should
Until I'm drumming on the day
Because the flames are getting higher
I bet you'll hear the tapping on the wall

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Yeah, yeah, ow!
With your boogie, man!
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Uhh!
Ha, ha, ha!
Yeah!

[Chorus:]

I'll be dancin' with myself
Dancin', yeah
I'll be dancin' with myself
Dancin'
(Dancin' with myself)
I said you made me dancin' with myself

Dancin'
Yeah, yeah
I won't stop dancin' by myself

Dancin' with myself
Yeah, yeah
Keep it up, keep it up
I won't stop now

Woo!
Ow!
Yeah, I feel nice
Uh!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Good God!
Shake it
Better boogie
Ya
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
