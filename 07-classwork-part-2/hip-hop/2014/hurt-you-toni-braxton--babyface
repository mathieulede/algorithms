[Verse 1: Babyface]
Here we go, damn
Here we go again
Loving you has caused me so much pain
But you don't see it, you never see it

[Verse 2: Toni Braxton]
So why apologize
I was just doing what I had to do baby
An eye for an eye

[Hook: Toni + Babyface]
God knows I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart, your heart babe
God knows I never meant to turn you on, turn you out
Never meant to take it that far, that far babe
God knows I never meant to hurt you, hurt you, hurt you, hurt you, hurt you, hurt you

[Verse 3: Babyface]
Baby, guilty as charged
I'm not gon lie babe
I did you wrong so many times yes
So I know why you crossed the line
Oh but girl I never dreamed you'd cheat on me

[Verse 4: Toni Braxton]
But I, (no, no) I apologize (don't apologize, don't apologize)
Oh baby, the pain I put you through (put you through it too
What I did to you (I did the same to you)
Oh I made you cry

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Can we start over again
Can we start baby as friends
Give you one more try
The tender kisses you give to me
Would be the only thing I'd ever need

God knows I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to break your heart, your heart babe
