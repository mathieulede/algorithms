Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
That's my fam, my hold 'em down for eva
Us against the world, we can bottle whomeva
Together ain't no way we gon' fail
You know I got your back, just like a turtle shell
Nobody do it better, all my brothers tryna get some cheddar
We all want our cut like the Shredder
Me and my bros come together for the dough
Bought the orange Lamborghini, call it Michelangelo
With the nun-chuck door and I'm pullin' up slow
When we fall up in the party, they know anything goes
Check my Rolex, they say I'm the man of the hour
All this green in my pockets, you can call it turtle power
(For when we fight together)
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
(Or when we ride together)
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
(Also for when we fight together)
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
(We can make it any better)
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Ain't nothin' that could come in between me and my brothers
We all around if it's going down
It's just us, all for one, yeah you hear 'em right
Our business done, we disappear into the night
Came up together, so we all down for the fight
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
Family, ain't nothin' strong as that
And I'll be posted up where the strongest at
Brothers by my side, city on my back, real heroes
That's what the people want
They ain't born, gotta create 'em
Sayin' we gone as soon as we save 'em
Thats part of the plan, by my side I'mma keep my brothers
Live or die man we need each other! Huh!

4 hittas, 4winners
Tryna tell 'em you don't wanna go to war wid us
We be them, we be them (young riders)
Raised in the gutters, really started (from the bottom)
Hey, we all we ever had, we all we ever needed and we undefeated
We be goin' hard, and make it look easy
Gimme the whole pie, real cheesy
I told ya God no! But you won't believe me
Takin' pics for me, told her smile fo' me
Pass her off, I'm a real team playa
Bandanna on my face like a gangsta
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked
