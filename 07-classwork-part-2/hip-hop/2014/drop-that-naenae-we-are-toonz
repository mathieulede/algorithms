As I smooth thru the ground
Got my hand up in the air
And I'm rockin' side to side
And I dance this heavy whirl

Yeah, this NaeNae takin' ova
So ya betta keep on head
Nae Ladies you and me
Turn up on the beat
You ain't gotta dance, we call it
Jiggin' on the beat
T double O And Z, we are lyin' in the streets
Hands up in an uh
In they face cause you don't care now

I pop bottles with models
All you pussy niggas need play dates

And they stay hatin' niggas
Like they part of the KKK
