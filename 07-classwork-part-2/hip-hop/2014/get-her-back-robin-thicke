[Hook]
(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light
(Keep her satisfied)
(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)
(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight

I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her back
I gotta treat her right, whoa I gotta cherish her for life
I gotta get her go, get her go, get her go, get her tonight

[Verse 1]
I never should’ve raised my voice, or made you feel so small
I never should’ve asked you to do anything at all
I should’ve kissed you longer
I should’ve held you stronger
And I’ll wait for forever for you love me again

[Hook]
(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light
(Keep her satisfied)
(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)
(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight

[Bridge]
Oh it’s so hard (it’s so hard)
Oh it’s so hard (Oh it’s so hard)
But it doesn’t have to be

Cause ...

[Hook]
(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light
(Keep her satisfied)
(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)
(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight
(All I wanna do)
Is keep it light, keep it light
(Keep her satisfied)
(All I wanna do)
Is make it right, make it right
(Is make you smile all night)
(All I wanna do)
Is give you that thing
Play you that song you and your girlfriends sing
(All I wanna do)
Is get you back tonight
