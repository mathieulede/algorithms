[Intro: Jason Derulo & Snoop Dogg]
Hey yo Jason
Say somethin' to her
Holla at her
I got one question
How do you fit all that in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt

[Hook: Snoop Dogg ]
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Just a little bit

[Verse 1: Jason Derülo]
Patty cake patty cake with no hands
Got me in this club, making wedding plans
If I take pictures while you do your dance
I could make you famous on Instagram

[Pre-Hook: Jason Derülo]
Hot damn it, your booty like two planets
Go ahead, and go ham sandwich
Woah I can't stand it
Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Just a little bit

[Verse 2: Jason Derülo]
Cadillac Cadillac, pop that trunk
Let's take a shot, Alley oop that donk
Tired of working that nine to five
Oh, baby let me come and change your life

[Pre-Hook: Jason Derülo]
Hot damn it, your booty like two planets
Go ahead, and go ham sandwich
Woah I can't stand it
Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
(Wiggle wiggle wiggle)
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
(Shake it shake it girl)
(Little bit, little bit, little bit)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Shake what your mamma gave you, misbehave you
I just wanna strip you, dip you, flip you, bubble bathe you
What they do
Taste my raindrops, k boo?
Now what you're willing, what you wanting, what you may do
Completely separated til I deeply penetrate it
Then I take it out and wipe it off
Eat it, ate it , love it, hate it
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I been
Can you wiggle wiggle for the D-O-double G again?

[Bridge: Jason Derülo]
Come on baby, turn around
You're a star, girl, take a bow
It's just one thing that's killing me
How do you fit that in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
Wiggle wiggle wiggle
(Shake it shake it girl)
Just a little bit
Wiggle wiggle wiggle

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Now make it clap (wiggle wiggle wiggle)
Now make it clap (wiggle wiggle wiggle)
Now make it clap (wiggle wiggle wiggle)
Now make it clap (wiggle wiggle wiggle)
Damn baby, you got a bright future behind  you
