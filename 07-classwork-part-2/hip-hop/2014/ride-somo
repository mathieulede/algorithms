Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Take off those heels
Lay on my bed
Whisper dirty secrets while I'm pulling on your hair
Poison in our veins
But we don't even care
Candles drippin' on your body
Baby this ain't truth or dare
Everybody wonders
Where we've run off to
My body on your body baby
Stickin' like some glue
Naughty, let's get naughty
Girl, it's only one or two
Fever's fucking running
Feel the heat between us two

[Hook]
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride
I'm I'm gon' ride
On you baby, on you lady
All night, all night
I'm gon' take care of your body
I'll be gentle don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride
I'm I'm gon' ride
On you baby on you lady
All night, all night
I'm gon' make you feel that love
And gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top
All the way down to your feet

And we can go slow
Yeah we can go slow

[Verse 2]
Lay on your back
Like you right there
Don't have to say it twice
Love, there's nothing here to fear
Takin' it back, back to where it's clear
Rollin' on and on sounds of love are in the air

[Hook]
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride
I'm I'm gon' ride
On you baby, on you lady
All night, all night
I'm gon' take care of your body
I'll be gentle don't you scream
It's getting hotter, make it softer
Feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride
I'm I'm gon' ride
On you baby on you lady
All night, all night
I'm gon' make you feel that love
And gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top
All the way down to your feet

[Bridge]
Love, love
Yeah
Sun's coming up
You're on my side
I rub your thigh
You look in my eyes
And I just see the sky (see the sky)
I'm so high (I'm so high)
But I ain't smoked yet
I'm just comin' down from this

[Hook]
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride
I'm I'm gon' ride
On you baby, on you lady
All night, all night
I'm gon' take care of your body (your body)
I'll be gentle don't you scream (don't you scream)
It's getting hotter, make it softer (make it hotter, make it hotter)
Feel your chest on top of me
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon' ride
I'm gon ride
I'm I'm gon' ride
On you baby on you lady
All night, all night
I'm gon' make you feel that love
And gettin' weak all in your knees
Kiss your body from the tip top
All the way down to your feet
