I've been watching you
Watching all the girls go crazy over you
Meet me on the floor
And let's talk about the special things you do
Give me what I want
And I'll do just what you want me to do
'Cause tonight I'm hot
And baby you got something I can use

I need a love injection
A bit of your affection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me
A love injection
To cure up my infection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me

Give me what I miss
Let me feel your kisses in the dark
Boy, don't make me wait
Why must you keep me hanging on
I'm not hard to please
If you'll give me what I need from you
'Cause baby I'm so hot
And you've got something I can really use

I need a love injection
A bit of your affection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me
A love injection
To cure up my infection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me
Oh

Come on
Give me the satisfaction that I like
Oooh, yeah
I need a love injection tonight

I need a love injection
A bit of your affection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me
A love injection
To cure up my infection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me

I need a love injection
A bit of your affection
A love injection
Won't you give it to me
A love injection
To cure up my infection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me
A love injection
A bit of your affection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me
A love injection
To cure up my infection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me
A love injection
A bit of your affection
Love injection
Won't you give it to me
Love injection
I need a love injection
