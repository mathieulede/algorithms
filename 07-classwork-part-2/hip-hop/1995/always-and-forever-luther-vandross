Oooh
Baby
Always and forever
Each moment with you
Is just like a dream to me
That somehow came true, yeah

And I know tomorrow
Will still be the same
Cuz we got a life of love
That won't ever change and

[1]
Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
Ooh baby, I'll always love you forever

Ever, ever, ever
There'll always be sunshine
When I look at you
It's something I can't explain
Just the things that you do, babe
If you get lonely
Call me and take
A second to give to me
That magic you make and

[Repeat 1]
Everyday love me your own special way
Melt all my heart away with a smile
Take time to tell me you really care
And we'll share tomorrow together
Ooh baby, baby I'll always love you forever

[Ad lib until fade]

(Always, forever love you)
Ooh baby, ooh baby
Yeah baby, yeah baby
Forever
(Always, forever love you)
Love you, love you, you
Always, always
(Always, forever love you)
Ever, ever, ever, forever
(Always, forever love you)
And always
Oooh yeah
(Always, forever love you)
Love you
Ever, ever, ever, forever
And always I'll love you
Forever, ever, ever
Guess I'm the one who, guess I'm the one who loves you
Always
(Always, forever love you)
And forever I love you
