When it's early in the morning
And you're laying next to me
As the sunlight melts into your skin
And you're looking so sexy
I can't explain what you do to me
But don't ever let it end

Baby, it's on
I'm enjoying it right now
I know what to do to make you give in

Lay back
Relax
I gotcha back
I'm giving you what'cha want
Don't cha wanna?
I'm telling you
What I'm gonna do to you to get through to you?

Cause I'm into you
I know what to do
I've got the flow
So let it show

I'm telling you what I know
Let's do it slow
Let's get it on
I'm having a situation
Stimulation meditation tells me so

[Chorus]
So baby
Just roll over on me
Ain't no cause to fight it
So come on, baby
Let's get excited

Baby
Just roll over on me
Cause I've got to let you know whatcha doing to me

When it's later in the evening
And your body's calling me
When the sun goes down
And the moon is out
And you're feeling so freaky
I can't believe what'cha do to me

But just keep it going on, baby
It's on until the break of dawn
I know  what to do to you, yeah

Lay back
Relax
I gotcha back
I'm giving you what'cha want
Dont'cha wanna?
I'm telling you
What I'm gonna do to you to get through to you?

Cause I'm into you
I know what to do
I've got the flow
So let it show

I'm telling you what I know
Let's do it slow
Let's get it on
I'm having a situation
Stimulation meditation tells me so

So baby
Just roll over on me
Ain't no cause to fight it
So come on, baby
Let's get excited

Baby
Just roll over on me
Cause I've got to let you know whatcha doing to me

Wake up, baby
It's time
Ooh

So, baby
Just roll over on me
Ain't no cause to fight it
So come on, baby
Let's get excited

Baby
Just roll over on me
Cause I've got to let you know whatcha doing to me

It goes on and on
And on and on
It goes on and on
And on and on

So baby
Just roll over on me
Ain't no cause to fight it
So come on, baby
Let's get excited

Baby
Just roll over on me
Cause I've got to let you know whatcha doing to me
