Riding down the city streets waiting to get down

Want to get your favourite treat somewhere in this town
Now we've got parking lots around
We've found a proper place

Just follow all the ring-roads that take you to the space

Pull up to the bumper
Baby
In your long black limousine

Pull up to the bumper
Baby
Drive it in - between
Pull up - to it - don't drive - throught it -
Back it - up wise - now that - it's nice

Operate around the park
All of you come in

There's space for everyone
One for you
My friend
The lines are sure how fixed you are
Oh
Won't you please come on?
Shining big machine you wheel
I've got to blow your heart

Pull up to the bumper
Baby
In your long black limousine
Place it - straying - let me - do the paying -

Pull up to the bumper
Baby
Pull up to the bumper
Pull up

Pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the bumper
Baby
Pull up

Pull up to the bumper
Pull up to the bumper
Baby

Pull up to the pumper
Pull up
Pull up to the bumper
Baby
