[Intro]
Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...
Ooh...I heard (I heard) it through grapevyne
(Boy, you know that I)

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
That you ain't feelin' too fine
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do

[Verse 1]
You looked into my eyes
You said to me that night
That you would never cheat on me
Or break my heart
Inside I never knew
Your love was so untrue
I thought that I was your only
Boy, was I wrong, so wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Never do somethin' that'll catch up to ya
(You had to lose a damn good thing)
Lovin' me could have been good
(Losing my love was a shame, baby)

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
That you ain't feelin' too fine (no no, baby)
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do (I really do, baby) really
Happened on the day I left
Since that day you haven't been the best (You haven't been the best, baby, no no no)
And I hope that you feel much better (Oh...)
Yes, I do

[Verse 2]
We choose to play love games
We lose, we face the pain
Those lonely nights and that heartache
That empty space
I'll share with you, my dreams
Those precious tender things
Everybody plays a fool
I guess I played my part for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Never do somethin' that'll catch up to ya
(You had to lose a damn good thing)
Lovin' me could have been good
(Losing my love was a shame, baby)

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
That you ain't feelin' too fine
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do (I really do, baby) really
Happened on the day I left
Since that day you haven't been the best (You haven't been the best, babe)
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do

[Verse 3]
Oh, boy, you had my faith, you had my trust, you had my love
But now I have to take it back, it didn't work for us
And all I really needed was your lovin'
Yes, all I really needed was your lovin'
I was your lady and there's nothin that I would not do
Now here's a Dear John letter that I've written just for you
And all I really needed was your lovin'
Yes, all I really needed was your lovin', hey...

[Pre-Chorus]
Never do somethin' that'll catch up to ya
(You did me wrong and told me lies)
Never do somethin' that you'll live to regret
(You hurt me so bad now babe)
Deep in my heart I feel sorry for ya
(You had to lose a damn good thing)
Lovin' me could have been good
(Losing my good love was such a shame, baby)

[Chorus]
I heard it through the grapevine
That you ain't feelin' too fine
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do (I really do, baby)
Happened on the day I left
Since that day you haven't been the best (You haven't been the best, baby)
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do (Oh.. lovin' Oh no)

[Coda]
Heard it through, heard it through (No-no-no-no-no-no-no)
I heard it through that great grapevyne (I heard it)
Heard it through (Grapevyne), heard it through
Grapevyne, grapevyne
