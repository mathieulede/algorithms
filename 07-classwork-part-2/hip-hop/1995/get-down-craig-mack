AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

[Verse 1]
Now who got the flav
That comes a dime a dozen
That keeps ‘em buzzin’
Thinking that is phat but wasn't
Welcome to the world of Mack
(of Mackman)
Like Biggie Smallz might say
I eat'em shits like Pac-Man
I'm incredible better eat ya vegetables
Cause... I does what I do you
(Do it!)
I fake the roof off of soft suckers
Super smackin...macking ...full effect mike check one two
I'm a reign...rain forever
Rain like bad weather....reign like whoever never
You can't bite my style
Cause my style ain't a style
That is a style
So I can go buck wild
Betcha figure you got more funk for flow
It ain't so
Flava in Ya Ear letcha know
Now I'm about a second, from the Hook duk
Strap ya rap book
Before you get ya wet style shook

[Hook]
Can I get down
Get down
Get on down
Can I get down

[Verse 2]
The Mack's like a superintendent
Burning MCs leaves a foul scent
See I'm like what ya call...king a yes ya'll
My style wreck shit...I mean real shit
Shit's thick..I come with the ammo
The real whammo stammo stuff that I be droppin
I wake great the lets warm up the hot plate
I'm changing fate from the neck I'm a castrate
My rap loves to alienate
Shake ya ass to the stake
You sunk by domniate
See I ain't scared of you muthafuckas
To me ya all suckers cause I make the ruckus
Don't try to buckus we roll with the cuf
No cuf on the roof bitin' like a sabertooth
I pound on the ground when I get down
So let me get down....let me get down

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To leap a tall building
Crush the earth-a-phone
But I'm sayin ain't no fair when MCs roam
The mic now in the right hands
Cause the Mack’s on the Earth just to spoil your plans
More pep than the peppa thats in ya peppa shaka
Ruff earthquaker..couldn't take me if ya mama make ya
I back up the funk that I bring
With unknown to mad slang
With bigger bite than the double-bang
I ain't met boot to hand
If ya testin in ya lesson
Got me dressin for ya funeral session
Man.....It won't even matter no more
Craig in 94' just won the war
My style definite to take ya over
Have ya sittin look over in a four door Chevy Nova
(Why I oughta)
I figure its a slaughter
In the world of dollars
Ya shit ain't nothing but a quarter
The name of the track is "Get Down"
So let me get down and pound other MCs in the ground

[Hook until the song end]
