[Intro]
*Heart rate under control*
Uh huh
Yeah
1 2 1 2
Fire up fire up this funk if ya have to
*Inhale* *Exhale*
Smoken' up blunts
Mad Dog 20 20
Fire up fire up this funk if ya ...

[Verse 1]
I grab the forty rip off the skirt
Guzzle it, grab the mic and come out the woodworks
When shit's thick and no time to think
Keeps Murray busy off of Basic Instinct
I puff an L and drink some liquor
Sit down and write a jam that receive the muhfuckin' stick-UP(A blessing from Buddha for grinding hard, the right way. See: KARMA.)
As God as my witness, with the sickness
Of a cannibalist cannabis
I floats like a cumulus
My perpetual rebel intellectual
Won't catch a bad experience with hallucinogenics either
I float strictly with the cannabis sativa
As my speech falls deeper than the scriptures
I smite graphic opponents, just like Picasso paintin' pictures(agreed? :))
If my eyes ain't red, it's all in my head
Once said by a Ph.D med
Legalize and I'll advertise, 'cos

[Refrain]
Yeah, I get lifted
Roll a Phillie and get
Roll a Ziggy and get
Fire up this funk
Yeah, like that y'all
Yeah word up, I get lifted
Roll/Puff the Phillie and get
Roll/Puff the ziggy and get
Fire up this funk, fire up this funk

[Verse 2]
This the real deal not a publicity stunt
I gets high like if the man in the Moon be puffing blunts
But verily barely merrily is it dope or the dream
Step into my chamber of intravenous smokescreen
I captivate it then motivate it, jealous of my desire
Smoke it down to the fire, anything to get a little higher
Hop in to college (accepting reality, facing), but to be truthfully frank (but still stays true and speaks true(TRU...))
Weed is knowledge, cause it makes me think
I pick anatomy and hem reality like Jah
Rastas read the bible, after puffin sensimillia
And the Sensi it gets me as a Fly(zZz), I ain't bullshitting
You can ask Bill Clinton, he can verify that

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Step into this intersection and take this rap
I got a vicious plot but first take me by the weed spot - http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fodCR0ilnGI/ThoWZubbvyI/AAAAAAAACTA/AnSFPsViq4E/s1600/evil_weed.jpg
I do this for my niggas locked down runnin capers
Smokin herb, in the bible papers
But how does it feel when you got no fire
And kyant pass de dutchie pon de left hand side (You can't pass the dutchie to the left 'cos the HEAT's outside?)
What the fuck, who the fuck wanna fuck (If U advertise your concern about Society's direction with heart, you'll wake up the sleeping(zZz) Gods (eg. Keith Murray)
With the six shot shooter, I murder you over buddha (Intellect at such a lvl, even a Buddhist Scholar can NO comprehende) See: Q :)
What I discuss'll bust a rhyme style nucleus
And roast them ghostes, puffin hocus pocus
So kid, pass that bomb (word: TRIBE) trom word bond (pass the VIBE WORLDWIDE)
So I can toke it with more wins than a python
Different Strokes for different folks
He like the chocolate thai
You like to float with the green skunky smoke
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Laid back hypnotized to the funky sound cause (Let yourself get captivated by the moment)

[Refrain]

Yo man, what's that guy's name, the Green Eyed Bandit
He worked with Redman, Redman, whatever the fuck his name is
- I would love to fuck a blue-skinned green-eyed girl (Avatarish)
