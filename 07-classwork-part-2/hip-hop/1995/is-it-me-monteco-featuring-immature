Chorus (2x):

Is it me that you like
Is it me that you're thinking of
Is it me, is it me

Monteco:

What can I do to make you my baby
So sweet to me, your love, baby
I dream about all the things that we could do
Is it you, or is me that gotta make the move

Chorus (2x)

Monteco:

I think it's time for you to tell me what's on your mind
'Cause your feelings can't hide inside your mind

Batman:

I think you want more, that's me
That pretty smile you gave
What can I do, oh, to get you in the mood, baby

Romeo:

Ooh wee, a cutie
Romeo's got the one with the big booty (Let me treat you right)
I'll treat you right
And do the things you like

Chorus (2x)

Monteco: Hey, yeah
Romeo: I got the one with the big booty, uh
Batman: Let me treat you right
Romeo: I'll treat you right
And do the things you like

Chorus (Repeat 'til Fades)
