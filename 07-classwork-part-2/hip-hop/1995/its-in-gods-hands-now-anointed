It's In God's Hands Now
(Come what may day to day
I know that He will make a way
Put it in God's hands)

I've done all I can to please you
But I can't wipe away that frown
I'm letting go, that's how much I love you
It's in God's hands now
I gave you my heart forever
And I will keep that solemn vow
But I can't put us back together
It's in God's hands now

CHORUS:
Lord knows I cried and cried
Cause I don't want to lose you
I tried, yes, I tried
But if I'm not the one who moves you
I won't hold you down

My head is in a cloud of sorrow
But my feet are on the ground
There's hope for us as long as there's tomorrow
It's in God's hands now

CHORUS
