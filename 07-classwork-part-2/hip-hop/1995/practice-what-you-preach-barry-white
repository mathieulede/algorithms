So, what do you want to do, I'm here baby
I'm ready baby, I'm waiting on you
Believe me, I am patiently
Waiting
On you

Girl there's something wrong with me
Every time I'm alone with you
You keep talking 'bout you loving me
Hey babe, your foreplay just blows my mind
So why don't we stop all the talking girl
Why don't we stop wasting time?

I've had, my share of love
And some say I'm damn good
But if you think, you can turn me out
Baby I wish that you would

Cause you keep telling me this and telling me that
You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well here I am baby, practice what you preach

Lady:
(I'm telling you this, I'm telling you that
Cause once I've been with you, you'll never go back
There is a lesson that I'm gonna teach)
Here I am baby, practice, what you preach

Girl it's just you and me, so many things
I could do to you and so many ways I can please
Hey, hey, hey it's your move (girl)
Why don't you start turning down the lights
And show me what you can do?

Well I've had my share of lovers
Some of them are damn good
But if you think, you can turn me out
Girl I just wish that you would
Cause you keep
Oh you just keep
Naw, you just keep

Cause you keep telling me this and telling me that
You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well here I am baby, practice what you preach

Ladies, baby, baby, baby
We're wasting time, precious time
All this talk about what you're gonna do
And how you're gonna do it to me
Come on, practice what you preach

Cause you keep telling me this and telling me that
You say once I'm with you, I'll never go back
You say there's a lesson that you want to teach
Well here I am baby, practice what you preach
