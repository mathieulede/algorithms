Just isn't fair 'cause I still care
Although I love you girl, I'd rather be alone
You want me to forgive you
You said please understand
Girl, you made me a fool
I thought that I was your only man
You don't know how it hurts me
To learn that I was wrong
Though I gave you my heart
You were just playing me all along
Too late to work it out
'Cause I know my minds filled with to much doubt
To ever try it again
I guess deep down I know you'll have to go
But it's just isn't fair 'cause I still care
Although I love you girl, I'd rather be alone
(I'd rather be alone)
I know it's wrong, I can't go on
Although I'll miss you girl, I'd rather be alone
(I'd rather be alone)
There was no need to use me
There was no need to lie
When I think of the times
We were together girl, I just cried
It's crazy but I still love you
After all things you've done
You don't know what you mean to me
Baby, I thought that you were the one
We can't work it out
'Cause I know that my hearts filled with too much doubt
To ever try it again
I guess deep down, I know you'll have to go
But it's just isn't fair 'cause I still care
Although I love you girl, I'd rather be alone
I know it's wrong, I can't go on
Although I'll miss you girl, I'd rather be alone
Girl, we can't work it out
'Cause I know my minds filled with to much doubt
To ever try it again, baby
'Cause deep down I know you'll have to go, it's not fair
Just isn't fair 'cause I still care
Although I love you girl, I'd rather be alone
(I'd rather be alone)
I know it's wrong, I can't go on
Although I'll miss you girl, I'd rather be alone
(I'd rather be alone)
Just isn't fair 'cause I still care
Although I love you girl, I'd rather be alone
(I'd rather be alone)
I know it's wrong, I can't go on
Although I'll miss you girl, I'd rather be alone
(I'd rather be alone)
Just isn't fair 'cause I still care
Although I love you girl, I'd rather be alone
(I'd rather be alone)
I know it's wrong, I can't go on
Although I'll miss you girl, I'd rather be alone
(I'd rather be alone)
