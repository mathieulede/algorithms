Mmm...mmm...
I dont wanna be a fool, I dont wanna be a fool for love
No, no, I won't, no
Hey, no, ooh...

I know that people do go through changes, yeah
But this just dont make no damn sense
If were gonna keep sayin we love one another, yeah, yeah
Well, then we better stop fightin and arguin

Cause baby, Ive heard Im sorry too many, many times before
Now I know better
It hurts to hold on to this kind of love even more
No, Im not crazy

I won't be a fool, a fool for love
Cause I know Id rather be alone than be here unhappy
Im not gonna choose, choose for you
Cause I know Id rather be alone than be here unhappy

I know its time to go when I feel lonely
When Im layin in your arms and it dont feel right, oh
Cause every time I feelin up you try to bring me down
So I feel good knowin I dont need you around

Cause I know, I know that I can feel this bad all by myself, hoo, yeah

And maybe thats my best bet
Startin this time Im gonna think selfishly
And never depend on someone else for keepin me happy, oh, no, no

I won't be a fool, a fool for love
Cause I know Id rather be alone than be here unhappy, oh, no
Im not gonna choose, choose for you
Cause I know Id rather be alone than be here unhappy, oh...

I-I-I-I won't be a fool, a fool for love
Cause I know Id rather be alone than be here unhappy
Im not gonna choose, choose for you
Cause I know Id rather be alone than be here unhappy, ooh, yeah

Im never gonna be a fool for love
Id rather be alone, just give it up
Dont make no sense to be in love
And be here unhappy, oh, no

It might feel good on a lonely night
But layin in your arms today ain't right
Id rather lose you than lose my mind
A
