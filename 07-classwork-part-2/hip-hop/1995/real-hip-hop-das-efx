[Verse 1: ]
Well on your marks and get set and can't forget to go
In case you didn't know the flow is fat like Joe (like Joe)
Yo, you niggedy know that I'm back man
You're wack man, I eat a rapper like I'm Pacman

Fo' realla, packin more hits than Lou Pinella

You dont impress me, a-yo Books kick the rest G...

[Verse 2: ]
Uhh, One time for yo mind
Eh yo what up it's
The crew bringing the ruckus no doubt
We's the roughest dream team
Reign Supreme like a Cutlass
Getting duckets, the dough
You can't touch the flow
It's me the Nigga wit G'z
The B double O K-S
So say yes I'll bust your caliber
When I pop shit and rock shit like Metallica
Straight to the heart of them snake fake niggas
Your all up in my face, wanna sell my tape niggas
So honey shake your figures and show me whatcha got

Won't be no discussion, strictly head crushing
Lead rushin trough your body
You're in my Dangerfield like Rodney
Howdy i'll back up in that ass G kaplowie
And now we got the game to a T like Howie
Allow me, to introduce myself and my peeps
Straight from the sewer
Stayin true to the streets

[Verse 4: ]
Well it's me crazy Drazy, bringin up the rear

So there, let me crack a brew and kick my feet up
Turn the heat up and smiggedy-smoke all the weed up

So stop and recognize the niggas on ya block

[Verse 5: ]
A-Yo Mc's is irrelevant, and delicate to the texture
But this style of mine is well defined like Webster
Ainâ€™t a better nigga raw from the jaw and the jabber-jibber
When I get Stone like Sharon from Sliver
Equipped to riggedy rip the microphone to shreds
Dread yo come and hit these niggas in the head

[Verse 6: ]
Well I connect my rhymes like Lego so lego my eggo
I burn ya like Waco, you need more than Maaco
I take it to ya crew and keep em moving like Im Uhaul
Im here to school yall, figgedy faggots like Rupaul
I throw a screwball and strike out the MC
And if he temps me, I knock em out like Jack Dempsey
I burn some sensi and chase em wit the Guiness
The illest, now hit me with the hook because I'm finished
