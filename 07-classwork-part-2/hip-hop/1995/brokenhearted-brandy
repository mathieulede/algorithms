Brokenhearted

[1st Verse]
I'm young but I'm wise enough to know
That you don't fall in love overnight, oh yeah
That's why I thought if I took my time
That everything in love would be right

But as soon as I closed my eyes
I was saying to love, "Goodbye"

[Chorus]
But I guess I'm only brokenhearted
Life's not over I can start again
While I'm lonely brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

[2nd Verse]
No more empty conversations
Next time I will be totally sure, oh yeah
Don't want the pain of falling in and out of love
It's more than my poor heart should endure

So I'll listen to all advice
And remember each time I cry

[Chorus]
That I guess I'm only brokenhearted
Life's not over I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

Only brokenhearted
Life's not over I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over (Starting all over again, oh)

Only brokenhearted
So I'll listen to all advice
And remember each time I cry, oh

Only brokenhearted
Life's not over I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over

Only brokenhearted
Life's not over, I can start again (Starting all over again, oh)
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over (Starting all over again, oh)

Only brokenhearted
Life's not over I can start again
While I'm lonely, brokenhearted
It's a hurting thing to get over, to get over
Only brokenhearted...
