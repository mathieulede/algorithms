[Verse 1:]
Show me a heart that's got no passion
I'll show you a heart that's got no life
Show me a man that doesn't give his heart
I'll show you a man that tells you lies

Oooh, you can try to run
But there's nowhere to hide
Love is stronger than your lies

Oh and oooh
You can deny it all you want
But love will win
It's just a matter of time

[Chorus:]
You know you can't run from love
You know, you know
You know you can't run

Ain't nowhere to hide
You know, you can't run you know
You know, you know
You know you can't run
Love is stronger than your lies

[Verse 2:]
Show me a heart that's not committed
I'll show you a man that doesn't try
Show me a heart that doesn't die for love

I'll show you an empty man inside
Oooh, you can run
But you won't find no place to hide

Love don't want your heart to die
Oh and oooh
You can deny love all you want
But love is strong and love won't be denied

[Chorus:]
You know you can't run from love
You know, you know
You know you can't run
Ain't nowhere to hide

You know, you can't run you know
You know, you know
You know you can't run
Love is stronger than your lies
