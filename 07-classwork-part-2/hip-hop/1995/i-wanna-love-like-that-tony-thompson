[Verse 1]
I wanna be the one who loves you
Even though you've got another
I wanna be the one who pleases you
I wanna be the one to kiss ya
Not like the other one who dissed ya
I wanna be the one who treats you cool, baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause I can see it in your eyes
All the love that you give, yeah
I wanna give love back can return
Oh baby, listen
I know that it's in your heart you'll always be true
Well, there's one thing you got missing
Girl, I belong with you

[Chorus]
I wanna love like that
I wanna baby girl like you
I wanna girl that turns me on
Like over and over
I wanna love like that
I wanna baby girl like you
Oh, come to me
And love me over and over

[Verse 2]
You wouldn't even have to wonder
You'll be my only lover
I wouldn't even breathe if there's no you
You can finally have the lovin'
You're so deserving of and
You could have a man that cares for you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can tell the way you walk
That your love is so sweet, yeah
I could tell it's sweet enough to eat
(You're sweet as candy)
Baby, when I hear you talk, you make it complete
The only thing that's missing is you belong with me

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I can see it in your eyes all the love that you give
I wanna give love back in return
Oh baby, listen
I know that it's in your heart you'll always be true
Girl, there's one thing you got missing
Girl, I belong with you

[Chorus 5X]
