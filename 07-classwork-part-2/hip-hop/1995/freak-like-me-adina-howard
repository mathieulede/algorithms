[Verse 1]
Let me lay it on the line
I got a little freakiness inside
And you know that the man
Has got to deal with it
I don't care what they say
I'm not about to pay nobody's way
Cause it's all about the dog in me

[Pre-Hook]
I want to freak in the morning
A freak in the evening,just like me
I need a roughneck nigga
That can satisfy me, just for me
If you are that kind of man cause I'm that kind of girl
I got a freaky secret, everybody sing
Cause we don't give a damn about a thing

[Hook]
Cause I will be a freak until the day until the dawn
And we can pump, pump all through the night till the early morn
Come on and I will take you around the 'hood on a gangsta lean
Cause we can pump, pump
Any time of day it's all good for me

[Verse 2]
Boy, you're moving kind of slow
You got to keep it up now, there you go
There's just one thing that a man must do
I'm packing all the flavor you need
I got you shook up on your knees
Cause it's all about the dog in me

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook x2]

[Bridge x3]
One to the two, to the two, to the three
Adina, do you want to get freaky with me

[Hook]
[Adina Laughs]
