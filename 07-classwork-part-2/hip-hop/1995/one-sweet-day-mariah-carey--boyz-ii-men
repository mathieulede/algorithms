Boyz II Men:
Sorry I never told you, all I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
Cause you've flown away, so far away

Mariah:
Never had I imagined, living without your smile
Feelin, knowin' you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

Together:
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

Mariah:
Picture a litte scene from heaven

Boyz II Men:
Darlin' I never showed you (no no no)
Assummed you'd, always be there
And I, I took your presence for granted
But I always cared (I always cared)
And I miss the love we shared

Together:
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

Boyz II Men:
Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day

Mariah
Yeah Yeah and Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

Together:
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together (together)
One sweet day

Sorry I never told you, all I wanted to say
