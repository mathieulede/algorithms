I used to think that you were down
I used to think that you were down
But when times got rough I saw the truth
I thought I found a design of love that could be real life
But our hearts drifted apart
They no longer bind
Nothing's alright you're out of my mind

Chorus:
I remember when you wouldn't come around
Now you want to be down
Not supposed to let you back in no way
I remember that day so well (so well, so well)
When you wouldn't talk to me
Now you see me everyday on TV

You tried to play me and got played in return
Messed up on a real man, now your bridges are burned
Gave me time to figure out your scheme it's all a dream now
Trying to get back in and you don't know how
Now your all out of order and denial

Chorus (repeats twice)

Gave me time to figure out your scheme it's all a dream now
You're trying to get back in and you don't know how
There's no way no how

Chorus (repeats twice and fades out)
