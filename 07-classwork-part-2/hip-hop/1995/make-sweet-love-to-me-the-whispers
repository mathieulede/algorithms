There's a place and time when you have to face
The fact that life is much too short to waste
You'll review your style of playing the field
Yes you will
And then you'll ask yourself who do you belong to
Who do you go home to girl
All the singles bars and expensive treats doesn't
Warm your body between the sheets
Though other men have touched your satin skin
They're strangers to your heart, they are just impostor's
I'm your true love doctor girl
Give me that love girl, give it to me
I'll take all you got
Give me that love girl, give it to me
Because to satisfy me takes a lot
A whole lotta lovin' give it to me
Serve it cold, I'll make it hot
Give me that love girl
I know all the right spots just tell me
When to stop girl
Oooh baby, what will it take for you to finally see (sweet,sweet lady)
That what you seek in others you have in me (ooowee baby)
You give yourself to others and when they're pleased (sweet, sweet lady)
They just get up and leave it's wham, bam, thank you ma'am
They don't give a damn oh girl( ooowee baby)
Though I may not be Michael J or the Prince (sweet, sweet lady)
I can make your life one hell of an event
Oooo, I'm as stable as a giant oak tree ( sweet, sweet lady)
Feel free to lean on me; we'll weather any storm
You're the reason I was born oh girl
Give me that love girl, give it to me
I'll take all you got
Give me that love girl, give it to me
Because to satisfy me takes a lot
And you're a lotta love girl give it to me
Serve it cold I'll make it hot
Give me that love girl
I know all the right spots just tell me when to stop
We have the right equipment to make a life commitment oh girl
Lady here I stand knowing that I can satisfy your needs
More than any other man
Oh, girl give me that love girl, give it to me
This moment begins the rest of our lives
Hey, you'll never know fear or hurt or ever
Have a reason to work
I'll be your bank and you will have the only key
Give me that love girl, give it to me
Day or night you can call on me
Oooh, each night you'll break into a sweat as I kiss
You where you pleasures are kept
How happy we'll be sharing kinky fantasies
