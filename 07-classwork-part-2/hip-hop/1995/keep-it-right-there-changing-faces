Anytime i need you baby you gave good love
And every time i turn around you're all that i'm thinking of
Lately you think our relation going too fast
Can we try it tonight now baby can we make it last
Keep it right there keep it right there if you wanna please me
Keep it right there keep it right there and i'll make it easy
Whenever you wanna do it wherever you wanna go
I know that i can get right with that if you just take it slow
Wish you know that everything you do is so damn fine
And i would like you love fair if you just take your time
So you gotta
Chorus
You know that i like what you do so slow down
And catch this groove
????won't you help us saying
Won't you help me say ooo
Oooo keep it slow
Oooo and make it easy
Oooo keep it slow
Oooo and try to please me
