You don't have to say this love's forever
I can see it in your eyes tonight
You don't have talk about tomorrow
Hold me in your arms tonight
My love
Silently you and me
Caress each other's hearts desperatley
We long to be lover's forever
Wanting you the way I do
Burns a fire deep inside
Touching you I never knew I could feel this way
You don't have to say this love is forever
I can see it in your eyes tonight
You don't have to talk about tomorrow
Hold me in your arms tonight my love
So tonight will love
Inside a warmth comes over me
Passion high
Feel so right
Love eternity
Words cannot begin to tell the way I feel for you
We share a special kind of love that's only shared by two
Words cannot begin to tell the way you make me feel
Unspoken is our passion; we share a love that's real...
Love!!...
Chorus
