[Intro]
How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough
To know when it's time
Time to let go

[Verse 1]
Sing
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

I just wanna sign
From the sweet Lord above
I know the answer is in front of me
But when you think you're in love
You only see what you wanna see
And all I see is me for you
And you for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I cannot hide the way I feel inside
(No I don't know why)
I don't know why but every day I wanna cry
(Every day I wanna cry)
If I give you one more try
To there rules, will you abide
And if I mean anything to you
Would it make everything all right

[Verse]
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

[Bridge]
I just wanna be so, so, happy
But the answer lies in me
I do believe
That we can be happy
I said I wanna be happy, yeah

Now let it bread

Life is too short
To be tryin to play some games
Now take some time and think about
If it's really worth losing me
Why must it be this way
Why do you have to play with my mind
All the time
Help me sing it


All I really want is for me to be happy
Ohhh, just help me sing it
All I really want is for me to be happy
Yeahhhhhhh
All I really want is for me to be happy
Oh, you know I wanna be happy, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy
All I really want is for me to be happy

[Outro]
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet

All I really want
Is to be happy
And to find a love that's mine
It would be so sweet
All I really want
Is to be happy...
