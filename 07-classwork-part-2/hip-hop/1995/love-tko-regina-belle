Lookin' back
Over my years
I guessed
I've shedded some tears
Told myself time
And time again
This time I'm gonna win

But another fight
Things ain't right
I'm losin' again
Takes a fool to lose twice
And start all over again

Think I'd better let it go
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'd better let it go
(What you think about it, girl)
Let it go, baby (Oh, yeah)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Mmm, mmm, mmm)

Tried to take control
Of the love
Love took control of me
'Cause you lose all thoughts
Sense of time
And have a change of mind

Takin' the bumps
And the bruises
Of all the things
Of a two-time loser
Tryin' to hold on
Faith is gone
It's just
Another sad song

I think
I'd better let it go
(What you say about it?)
Looks like
Another love T.K.O
(Oh, oh, ho, whoa, yes)
I think
I'd better let it go
Let it go, baby
(Oh, baby)
Looks like
Another love T.K.O
(Mmm, hmm, oh, ho, oh)

Oh, ho, whoa, ho
Ooh, hoo
Oh, ho, oh
Ooh, ooh
Mmm, mmm

Tried to take control
Of the love
Love took control of me
'Cause you lose all thoughts
Sense of time
And have a change of mind

Takin' the bumps
And the bruises
Of all the things
Of a two-time loser
See I try to hold on
My faith is gone
It's just another sad song

And I think
I'd better let it go
(Let it go, let it go)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(I think I'd better)
Think I'd better let it go
Let it go, baby
(If I know
What's good for you, girl)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(I couldn't stand
This pain much longer)

Think I'd better let it go
Let it go, baby
(Whoa, oh, yeah)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Ooh, ooh, baby)
(Oh, sometimes, sometimes
I just feel like I wanna say)
(I wanna say, mmm, mmm)

'Cause it looks like
Another love T.K.O
(Tired of gettin' beat up by love)
Think I'd better let it go
Let it go, baby
(Before it's too late, yeah)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Hey, ey, oh, yeah)
(Mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm, mmm, hmm)

Think I'd better let it go
(Yeah)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(Hey, yeah, whoa
I think I'd better)
Think I'd better let it go
(Let it go)
Let it go, baby
(Oh, yeah)
Looks like another
(Yeah) love T.K.O
(Oh, they say love is better
The second time around)

Think I'd better let it go
(I can't stand on my feet)
Looks like another love T.K.O
(I'm falling down, no
'cause, 'cause, 'cause)
I think I'd better let it go
(Let it go, baby)
