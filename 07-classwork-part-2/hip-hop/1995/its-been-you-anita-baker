I had a dream
A love dream so tender
You were with me old friend
We gave in to sweet surrender

And I've held it in through October
November
No wonder
I never been the same since then

I picked up my phone
A million times to call you
But I lost my nerve
Cause every time I saw you
Like a lovesick kid
Child, it was my paranoia

You'd laugh
But instead
You read these thoughts inside my head
And it's you

It's been you all the time
You're changing my whole state of mind
It took just a minute
But now that I'm in it
It's you

It's been you all the time
Like somebody turned on a light
You're gonna watch me shine
It's been you all the time

Now when you smile
The world opens up for me
You're just my style
And inside
I do believe

We're two of a kind
How could I be so blind?
My heart, its sincere
I believe I've wanted you for years and years

You're changing my whole state of mind
It took just a minute
But now that I'm in it
It's you

It's been you all the time
Like somebody turned on a light
You're gonna watch me shine
It's been you all the time

Now to think
You've always been right here
And loneliness has been my greatest fear
Until I saw the answers in your eyes
Yes, I did

And at last
It's clear
Now I see that
You're the only one for me

You're changing my whole state of mind
It took just a minute
But now that I'm in it
It's you

It's been you all the time
Like somebody turned on a light
You're gonna watch me shine
It's been you all the time
