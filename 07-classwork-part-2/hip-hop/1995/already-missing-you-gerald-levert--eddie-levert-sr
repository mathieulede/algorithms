Aw girl, what's up? Aw, not again
So you're packin' your bags
And you're leaving? But that ain't right
You need to stay awhile, think about it
But wait a minute, before you go
There's just one thing I want you to know
We both agree that this love
Ain't what it used to be, we just grew apart
I got nothin' but love for you, baby
Girl, you'll always be my heart
It's gonna to be strange living without you
Ain't felt so empty before, no
See, I miss your smile
And even your fussin'
When I left my clothes on the floor
Oh, baby, say now
I'm gonna miss your face
I'm gonna miss your moods
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
And even though you haven't gone yet
I'm already missing you
I'm already missing you
It's hard to say goodbye
But things will be better
You go your way and I will go mine
Let's keep in touch
Let me know how you're doing
Girl, things will change in time
Don't want you to leave
Keep sayin' I'm sorry
But I guess I'm repeating myself
Girl, you know I'm here
When you need a shoulder
I can't see you in the arms
Of someone else, oh baby
I'm gonna miss your face
I'm gonna miss your moods
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
I'm gonna miss your face
I'm gonna miss your moods
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
I'm gonna miss your face
I'm gonna miss your moods
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
I'm gonna miss your face
I'm gonna miss your moods
I'm gonna miss makin' love to you
