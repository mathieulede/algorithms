Operator
Get my baby on the line
Cause just the other night
We had a horrible fight
I admit that i
I was out of control
But i still love my man
With my body and soul

When the road gets rough
You say thangs you should not say
I never meant
To treat my baby that way

I apologize
Oh believe me i do
I apologize
Oh honest and true
Because i know i was wrong
So i'll sing you this song
Cause i wannna get through
And make it up to you yeah

Operator
It was like a bad dream
Lord you should have heard
The way he shouted
And the way that i screamed
I regret it
Cause i was unfair
I took it all out on him
Just because he was there

When the road gets rough
You say thangs you should not say
I never meant
To treat my daddy that way

I apologize
Oh believe me i do
I apologize
Oh honest and true
Because i knew i was wrong
And so i'll sing you my song
Yeah yeah yeah

I apologize for i was unkind
And i wish that i
Could go back in time
Erase the good-byes
And rewrite my life
Well come rain or come shine
I'm gonna do right this time
I apologize

Oh oh
Um um yeah
Oh baby i do
Because i knew i was wrong
That's why i'm singing
My my my song
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I apologize oh yeah
I apologize oh yeah oh yeah
