I remember the way, you used to love me
I remember the days, you used to love me

Verse 1:
You don't appreciate the time
I put into this love affair of ours baby
I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down

Hook:
(I remember)
I remember (the way) the way you used to love me
(Baby I remember the way)
I remember the days you used to love me
(oh you used to love me)

Verse 2:
I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me calling out
Calling for your warm affection after all this time

Bridge:
You can't deny what I'm feeling is real
And I stood around, stood by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
And you turned and walked away

(I remember)
I remember (I remember) the way you used (you used to love me) to love me
(Baby)
I remember the days you used to love me
(oh remember)

Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me
Give it to me
What a feeling it's for real

(I remember)
I remember (I remember) the way you used (Baby you use to love me) to love me
I remember the days you used to love me

You didn't hear me calling out
And that's not what love's about
I remember you used to love me
You used to love me every day (every day, every day)
Now your love has gone away
I remember I remember


(Baby, I remember)
I remember (I remember) the way you used (used to love me every day) to love me
I remember (I remember, I remember) the days you used to love me


Oh baby you used to walk holding my hand (I remember the way you used to love me)
Cuz you used to be my man
I remember, all the way (I remember the way you used to love me)
Didn't hear me calling out
And that's not what love's about
I remember oh oh oh, baby you used to love me (I remember the way you used to love me)
Baby you used to love me
I remember the way you used to love me (I said I remember...)
