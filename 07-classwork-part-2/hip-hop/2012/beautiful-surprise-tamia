For the first time in my life I just might be tongue tied
For me to wake up with you kissing me
Saying you've been missing me
What a beautiful surprise

'Cause I wasn't expecting you till late tonight
No, and I didn't hear you come inside
But there's nothing in this world that I want more
Than to have my baby back in my arms, all I can say is

Uh ah, so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Uh, ah my man is back on my side
What a beautiful surprise

I ain't that easy to shock but it looks like you hit the spot
For me to wake up with you holding me
And telling me you loving me
You've got my heart on love

Yeah, 'cause I wasn't expecting you till late tonight
No, and I didn't hear you come inside
But there's nothing in this world that I want more
Than to have my baby back in my arms all I can say is

Uh, ah so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Uh, ah my man is back on my side
What a beautiful surprise

I was needing you so bad, you know
It feels like I'm dreaming, my mind explodes
For you to be the first thing that I see when I open my eyes
Such a beautiful, beautiful surprise

Uh, ah so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Uh, ah my man is back on my side
What a beautiful surprise

Uh, ah so happy that I could cry
What a beautiful surprise
Uh, ah my man is back on my side
What a beautiful surprise

A beautiful surprise, yeah
A beautiful surprise, yeah
A beautiful surprise, yeah
A beautiful surprise, yeah
A beautiful surprise, yeah
