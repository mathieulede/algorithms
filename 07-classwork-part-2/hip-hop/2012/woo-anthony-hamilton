I was like mindin' my business
Wasn't thinking 'bout strikin' up no conversation
(Uh Uh)
But she has those thick thangs and a round about
Like the devil said "boy how's bout a little temptation"
(Oh no)

She was so fine
Could not keep my eyes off her
It was critical, even Biblical like
Just like Delilah
Say

Woo-oo-oo-oo
O Girl you're so bad
Woo-oo-oo-oo
But it feels so good
Woo-oo-oo-oo
I ain't neva seen a girl so bad

I've been like Mr. Perfect goody two shoes
Couldn't break me down for nothin'
(Uh huh uh huh)
Always knew that messin' round ain't worth it
Till I met her, well so much for my nothing, nothing
(Yeaaah)

She was so fine
Could not keep my eyes off her
It was heavy like Delilah
Set my soul on fire

Woo-oo-oo-oo
O Girl you're so bad
Woo-oo-oo-oo
But it feels so good
Woo-oo-oo-oo
I ain't neva seen a girl so bad

She's so fly, she's so bad, but she's trouble, yeah
Kicks my strong, makes me weak, till I crumble
I don't know what to do, I say double
Forgive me if I wanna do wrong

Woo-oo-oo-oo
I've never seen a girl so bad
Woo-oo-oo-oo
But it feels so good
Woo-oo-oo-oo
I ain't neva seen a girl so bad

Never, never seen a girl so fine
Woo, never in my life
Woo, I've never, I've never
I've never seen a girl so bad
Never baby
