[Hook]
I feel like the girl at the bar who’s been there too long
Can’t stand up!
I should be gone but I just can’t get enough, yeah!

[Verse 1]
Fumbling, giggling, silly as ever I get like this after one too many
But right now I ain’t even been drinkin'
He approached me and asked for a minute
Which turned into five, then turned into ten
And right now I don’t know how to say when

[Chorus]
So can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Yeah, of your time
Cause you’re intoxicating my mind
Feel like a conversational lush
Cause I don’t know how much is too much, yeah
I feel like the girl at the bar who’s been there too long
Can’t stand up!

[Verse 2]
Wishin' and hopin' that I don't blow it I'm nervous as hell
I don’t wanna show it
And right now I don’t even know what I’m saying
I've never had game, no never
I don’t wanna sound like a broken record
But until you say goodnight
All I know is that I’m staying!

[Chorus]
So can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Yeah, of your time
Cause you’re intoxicating my mind
Feel like a conversational lush
Cause I don’t know how much is too much, yeah
I feel like the girl at the bar who’s been there too long
Can’t stand up!

[Bridge]
I need a shot of
You on the rocks
Cause I’m down to my very last drop

[Chorus]
So can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Baby, can I get a refill?
Yeah!

[Hook]
Cause I feel like the girl at the bar who’s been there too long
Can’t stand up!
I should be gone, but I just can’t get enough

[Outro]
So can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
(I feel like the girl at the bar who’s been there too long
Can’t stand up!
I should be gone, but I just can’t get enough)
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill, baby?
Baby, can I get a refill?
Baby, can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
