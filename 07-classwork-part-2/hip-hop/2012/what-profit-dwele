My man was steady stacking chips, riding in the classy whips
Living every day like his birthday
And house gotta door with the door man
But it seems that your man forgot what you need in the worst way

Is to be loved, from the top of your head
Down to your pretty pedicure toes, whoa
You wanna be loved, it's the thing that last long
After all the money comes and goes

What profit a man, to gain the whole wide world
To lose his girl, lose his girl
If I was your man, I'd do all that I can to keep you girl
What profit a man

Lately when he took you out
Mostly all he talked about were things that meant little to you, babe
Hollywod had him gone, he forgot what turned you on
Almost as if he never knew you

Needed to be loved, from deep inside of your mind
Down to the depths of your soul, oh
You wanna be loved
You see love lasts long, after all the money comes and goes

What profit a man, to gain the whole wide world
To lose his girl, lose his girl. hey it means nothing in life unless I got you
If I was your man, I'd do all that I can to keep you girl
Yeah, I'd do what I can, what profit a man

To get these material things, and turn around and lose your queen
The one who was there, ridin' for you when it was all just a dream
How you gonna get brand new
With the only girl who ever loved you, ooh baby

What profit a man, to gain the whole wide world
To lose his girl, lose his girl, hey I'd rather not lose you baby
If I was your man, I'd do all that I can to keep you girl
Just to keep you, what profit a man

What profit a man, to gain the whole wide world
To lose his girl, I'd rather lose everything than lose you
If I was your man, I'd do all that I can to keep you girl
What profit a man
