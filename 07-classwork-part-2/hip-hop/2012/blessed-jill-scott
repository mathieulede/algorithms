[Verse 1]
This is the last take for the night
Understand it's kinda late
And I gotta get home to my son
Cause he's so special to me
I mean I gotta see him
I need to breathe him
That's my baby, don't call me crazy
I love the studio but I love him more
Let me give you what I got so

[Chorus]
I woke up in the morning feeling fresh to death
I'm so blessed, yes yes
I went to sleep stressed, woke up refreshed
I'm so blessed, yeah yes
Water in my face and everything is in its place
Peace of mind even my grace
I'm so blessed, yes yes yes

[verse 2]
My grandma almost lived to see ninety two
I'm so blessed, yes yes yes yes
My son was born healthy and beautiful
I'm so blessed, yeah yes
My momma's on my right side
Daddy on my left, my son father doing his absolute
I'm so blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, yeah yeah yes

And I know what I know
And I know what I know

[bridge]
Yeah yeah struggle don't happen
It's just the way it be
Ain't nothing coming easily in this life
Sometimes you gotta work and you gotta grow and it gotta hurt
I'm sure you know
Take a look around

[verse3]
Woke up this morning listening to this song
It's so blessed, yes yes
Gonna rock this jawn all night long
It's so blessed, yes
To be up in here with our hands up in the air
Waving like we just don't care
We're so blessed, yes yeah yeah yeah

Woke up in the morning feeling fresh to death
Went to sleep stressed woke up refreshed
Momma's on my right side, daddy on my left
I'm so blessed, yes yes yes
