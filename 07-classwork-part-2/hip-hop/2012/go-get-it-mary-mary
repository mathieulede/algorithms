[Verse 1:]
It's like you're looking through a telescope
You see where you gon be
Growing getting better
You're not the person they see
Can't be mad at the things you've been through
Cuz they built your muscle
Now you're stronger than you ever been
They can't stop your hustle
Yo faith ain't never small that's what brought you this far (yeah) See you got yo dreams and you got your prayers and you got your God he gon take you there
See everybody has a season
And i believe this one's yours
See you've been working waiting this what you've been praying for

[Hook:]
Go get it (5x)
Go get your blessing
Go get it (5x)
It's yo time (4x)

You were made to live a good life and that's what i believe
Say a prayer hit the floor start working you gotta do something It's alright to crawl before you walk, it's alright to walk before you run
But if wanna get what you never got gotta do something that you never done

[Repeat Hook:]

[Bridge:]
You've been qualified
But his mercy multiplied
You cannot be denied
Cuz you're finally certified
It's official
Go ahead and testify
He's gon bless you
You gon bless him
Now God be glorified

[Repeat Hook 2x's]
