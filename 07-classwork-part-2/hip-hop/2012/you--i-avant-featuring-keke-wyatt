[Intro: Avant]
Wooh
Ladies and gentlemen
And all the lovers around the world

I wanna talk about the one I love
I know a lot of times we forget
How they take good care of you
But tonight I just wanna express the way I feel

[Verse 1: Avant]
Oh, baby
Funny how things have
Changed in my life now

Whether near or far
I wanna be where you are
And you're like a rose
That blooms in my garden

Innocent and sweet
My love, you are
But one thing I know, girl

[Bridge 1: Avant]
Loving, loving
Ohh

Loving
Loving you is easy
For me to do baby
And, I will feel this way
Till the end of time (owhh)

Even though you've heard his thousand times
It's the truth
Oh, baby

[Chorus: Avant & Keke Wyatt]
You and I
Together for always
Baby, I
Breathe every single breath for you, baby
Owh, boy

You and I
One hell of a chemistry
Baby, I
I'm living out this life for you

[Verse 2: Keke Wyatt]
Oh, darling
I know that things in life are not perfect
But when it comes to you
You're all that and more baby (oowh)

Heaven's my destiny
When I'm with you
The only place to be just you and me
Ohhh

[Bridge 2: Keke Wyatt]
My life, my life, my life
My life is so incomplete without you baby (oohh, owhhh)

I will feel this way to the end of time (yeah)
Even though you heard this 1000 times
It's the truth
Whooaah, baby

[Chorus: Avant & Keke Wyatt]
You and I
Together for always
Baby, I
Breathe every single breath for you, baby
Owh, boy

You and I
One hell of a chemistry
Baby, I
I'm living out this life for you

[Avant & Keke Wyatt]
Oh, baby

[Avant]
I love you
[Keke Wyatt]
I love you
[Avant]
All of you
[Keke Wyatt]
All of you, I
[Avant]
You're everything, babe

[Keke Wyatt]
Yeah
[Avant]
Ohhh
[Keke Wyatt]
I love you, baby
[Avant]
Babe, yeah
[Keke Wyatt]
I love you, baby
[Avant]
You make me complete, ahhhhh
