Loving you is hard
I feel like I'm about to hurt myself
And I don't want to do it baby
I'm loving you so hard
In a way you acting been nowhere
So no no no sugar
(yeah, you got it sweet don't you)
You must be glad
You must be dumb
You must be trippin'
You must be crazy
To think that i'mma let you off that easy
I know you're mad
Can't take no more
But put that bag, that ain't yours
Have a feat, slam the door
Don't need a mess on the floor
That shit belongs to me
Those clothes, those cars, those rings
That mad book, that shit belongs to me
So log off your facebook
It All Belongs to Me
How you do it tough
Never knew you do too nothing else
You ain't good enough baby
It's like you got no heart
Cold as ice, and nothing can make you melt
No no no baby
Hold on one minute baby
You must be glad
You must be dumb
You must be trippin'
You must be crazy
To think that i'mma let you off that easy
I know you're mad
Can't take no more
But put that bag, that ain't yours
Have a feat, slam the door
Don't need a mess on the floor
That shit belongs to me
Those clothes, those cars, those rings
And that mad book, that shit belongs to me
So log off your facebook
It All Belongs to Me
Ain't nothing leaving this house
Unless it's over my dead body baby
So cut that off of that shit chain
Cause loving you is yesterday pray
I know you're mad
Can't take no more
But put that bag, that ain't yours
Have a feat, slam the door
Don't need a mess on the floor
That shit belongs to me
Those clothes, those cars, those rings
And that mad book, that shit belongs to me
So log off your facebook
It All Belongs to Me, to Me
And that belongs to me, to me
It All Belongs to Me, to Me
It All Belongs to Me
