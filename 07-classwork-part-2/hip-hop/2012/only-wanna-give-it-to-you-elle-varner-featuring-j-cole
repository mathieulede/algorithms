[Verse 1: Elle Varner]
Thought you were just another Romeo
The shoe you pass by in the store window
But soon as I got home I wish I bought you instead
I got it bad, I'll take the black, take the navy and red
No other man has ever, ever had quite this effect
I sleep alone cause there's no room in my bed
For any other lover, you're no good to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage
And I don’t wanna stop it

[Hook]
Cause I only wanna give it to you
And I want you more than a new pair of shoes
I only wanna give it to you
And I sure do hope that you feel like I do

[Verse 2: Elle Varner]
I came before this digital ocean
Where folks only move in digital motion
But you’re so classic, I want you more than my Adidas
All the bees are getting at you cause your honey is sweetest
I need you, you're no good to my head
Your kisses hold me hostage and I don’t want to stop it

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Give me this good, what can I say?
I just don’t know, my love ain't no trip for the weekend
Here to stay for all of the seasons
You’re the weakness that I can’t control

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Baby you all I need to get by
You’re fly, so you’re all I need to get high
You got it? Uh, so put ya number in this camera phone
And we can live like the camera’s on, no script though
These boys claiming they ball, got no grip though
My flow switch mode, it’s so schizo
So I’m the one that your girl blow a kiss for
You've gotta love me, Cole World, no Snuggie
Baddest girls hug me, my mind on you though
You’re hoping I’m the one
But I already knew though
It ain’t no secret that I get around, true
But girl, you make me want to settle down with you
Get a crib with a view, lay up in the bed, make a kid, maybe 2
All my ex-girlfriends gon' have to get a clue
Cause the rumors that you heard about is true

[Hook]
