Girls talkin bout

[VERSE 1]
Eh, shawty what's ya name, what's your number?
Oh you heard about my age, well forget that number
I can put the thrill in your life
I can make you dreams come to life
I hear you talking, I know that I’m what you like
Swagger on a hundred thousand million and beyond
I see you talking to your friends looking at me in the corner of your eye
You know you know I would rather
Be with you no one would matter
Cause I, I hear you talkin and girl I know what you like

[Pre-Hook]
I’ll take off my shades, show you my eyes
I can see right through you, girl I know you ain’t shy
You put in work, overtime
See I got you talking, I know y'all girls be talkin

Get all up in my face, lemme see ya more clearer
Where all the girls with the the dimples?
Smile for me, it's that simple
I hear you talking and girl I know what you like
