Been a long time, I've been missing your body
Let me-let me turn the lights down
When I-when I go down, it's a private party

Give it to her in the worst way
Can't wait to blow her candles out

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Doggy want the kitty
Give me a heart attack and throw it back
Now watch me get it
And you knew this but you the shit
Damn girl, you pretty
Blowing out your candles
Let me make a couple wishes

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Remember how you did it?
Remember how you fit it?
If you still wanna kiss it
Come-come-come and get it
Sweeter than a rice cake
Cake worth sipping
Kill it, tip it, cake, fill it

[Verse 4: Rihanna]
If you sexy and you know it
And you ain't afraid to show it
Put a candle on my ma'fuckin' back
Baby, blow it
Love the way you do when you do it like that
Show up with the stacks
Raining racks on my rack
Wrap it up, wrap it up
Boy, while I take this bow off
Talk that talk
Yeah I know I'm such a show off
Daddy, make a wish
Put this cake in your face
And it's not even my birthday

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ooh it's not even her birthday
But I wanna lick the icing off
Give it to her in the worst way
Can't wait to blow her candles out

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I want that cake-cake-cake-cake-cake
Cake-cake-cake-cake-cake
Cake-cake-cake-cake-cake
(Bet you wanna put your name on it)
Ooh baby I like it
You so excited
Don't try to hide it
I'ma make you my bitch
Cake-cake-cake-cake-cake
Cake-cake-cake-cake-cake
Cake-cake-cake-cake-cake
Cake-cake-cake-cake-cake
Cake-cake-cake-cake-cake
Cake-cake-cake-cake-cake
(Bet you wanna put your name on it)
