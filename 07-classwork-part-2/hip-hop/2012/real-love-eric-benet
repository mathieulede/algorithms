Oh babe
Don't you know you got the real, real love

Precious, a word that comes to mind
When the morning come and you're asleep by my side
Cherish, a word that could describe
How our love has stood the minute test of time, analyze

There's a whirlwind
Of changes this life may bring
But the real thing just holds off could what may
And we got something real baby

Real love, real love
In a world full of make believe
We got something real girl
Real love, real love, I bet everything on you and me

I love you, not just for who you are
But for the way you made a better man out of me
Now I try, I try , I swear baby every day I try
To live a life deserving of this joy you give to me, to me

Now you got your funny ways girl
Lord knows I've got mines
Still we keep on getting better, better all the time
'Cause we got something real babe

Real love, real love
In a world where nothing's what it seems
We got something real girl, real love, real love
Just standing strong for the whole word to see

Don't ever question what my heart needs tomorrow
Girl I just want the same ol' love you gave me today
We got it for sure
Kind of love that knows that joy brings some sorrow

But we can't go wrong if we just hold on
Ain't nothing's stronger

Real love, real love
In a world full of make believe
We got something real babe
Real love, real love, I bet everything, everything on you and me

Don't you know we got a real
Don't you know we got a real love for sure
Don't you know we got a real
Don't you know we got a real love for sure
