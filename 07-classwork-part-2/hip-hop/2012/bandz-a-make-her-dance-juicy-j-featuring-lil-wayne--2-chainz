Bands a make her dance [x6][2x]
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I'm just popping bands
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't using handsShort hair like Nia Long, loose one she don't need a loan
She start twerking when she hear a song, the stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some, so nasty when she rolling
She put that ass off in my hands, I remote control it
She give me dome when the roof gone, at the K.O.D. she leaves with me
She got friends bring three, I got drugs I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J, gone poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy, juicy j can't
Racks everywhere, they're showing racks I'm throwing racks
In the VIP rubber on I'm stretching that
Rich niggas tipping, broke niggas looking
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showing pussy.[2x]
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I'm just popping bands
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't using hands.[Lil' Wayne]
Uhh... Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel-nigga
Smokin' on Keysha, Cole give me chills nigga
What's your real name, and not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bands a make her dance, tunechi make her cum
Hit it from the side like a motherfuckin' bass drum
Two hoes on one fuckin' pole, two hoes on my fuckin' pole
I don't tip I pay bills, bitches call me Buffalo
Her stomach in, her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waitin' for my bitch to cash out![2x]
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
All these chicks poppin' pussy, I'm just poppin' bands
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin' and they ain't using hands[2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, four bracelets
Let me see that ass clap, standing ovation
If yo girl don't swallow kids, man that hoe basic
Got two bitches wit me, take a shot of one hoe
Using her friend for a chaser
Bands a make her buss it, buss it
Let me see you touch it, touch it
Money talk you ain't got none, end of discussion
Bands a make her do it, do it
Pocket full of money, money!
Young nigga getting head while the engine runnin'
Errrr!! Let me see you wiggle do it for a real nigga
I be laughing to the bank, all you do is giggle
Balling in my coupe, call it sports car
Drop the top and freak the chick that bitch looks like a porn star![2x]
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I'm just popping bands
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't using handsDown in Atlanta, about to hit up magic
Throw some money in the air all the bad bitches gone grab it
Straight off the floor she gonna need a couple of bags
Like a broke atm I'm a spillin all this cash
Them niggas in the club don't be spending shit
Twenty stacks in one night, I be on trippy shit
My crib's paid off, but I'm still paying rent
A couple of condos paid, she loving every cent
She make that ass clap dancing like she on a dick
Bring it back I threw a stack that's a lucky bitch
Up and down she's going she's sliding on that pole
Making money stacking up hundreds shawty cold[2x]
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I'm just popping bands
Bands a make her dance, bands a make her dance
These chicks clappin', and they ain't using hands
