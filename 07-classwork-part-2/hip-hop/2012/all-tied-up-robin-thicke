[Verse 1]
Hey girl, I've been thinking
About you in see-through secrets
Crawling on my thousand-thread count down, down, down
Play, play hard to get as you know I love to chase that
Till you push me on the bed and start your show

[Hook]
Baby, cause I'm all tied up inside, come save me
I get lonely, I get blue
I want you baby, I need you
Baby, cause I'm all tied up inside, come save me
I get lonely, I get blue
I want you baby, I need you

[Verse 2]
Lay, lay across my pillow, as you make love to me ego
And you always treat me like a superstar
Oh, I'm so obsessed, you know I'm such a mess
When I see you get undressed and start your show

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm all tied up
(And I get so locked up inside)
I'm all tied up
(All I need is you and you got the key baby
Only you can release me)
I'm all tied up
(I need your love, Oh I need you to save me, baby
Oh, you got the key, come on and set me free)

[Hook]
