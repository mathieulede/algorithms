[Intro]
"I can't believe you're playin' me like this
After all the love we shared
The good times we've had, remember, yeah"

Feels like it's over
My heart tells me she's in love with someone else
Gave me the cold shoulder
But it's her loss, cause I could find me somebody else
If she wanna hit the town and party all night with her friends
If she wanna fool around, woah
Then two can play that game baby

[Hook]
You got me feelin' single, 'bout to get out
Find somebody, who's gonna love me
Feelin' single, night is young
Hit the club, and take somebody home with me
Get it, get it, get it, get it
WE can get it baby get it, get it
Now that I'm single

She said forever
Turned out to be the biggest lie of all time
And she changed my weather, yeah
Rainin' all day, no chance of sunshine
If she wanna hit the town and party all night with her friends
If she wanna fool around, yeah
Then two can play that game baby

[Hook]

The way I see it you're not gonna do right
Oh by me baby girl
Then I might as well, then I might as well
I might as well get out and mingle
Cause you got, you got, you got me feelin' single

[Hook]
