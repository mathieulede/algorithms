Makes any difference
I still love you girl
You're my weakness
You changed my world
Share my life
Trust in me
You're all I want
Everything I need (baby)
Makes any difference
I give you all my heart
Girl my sun sets
Anywhere you are
Maybe I'm a dreamer
You're still my queen
Your love's like a river girl
Runnin' right through me
Share my life
Trust in me
You're all I want
Everything you need
Makes any difference
I still love you girl
You're my weakness
