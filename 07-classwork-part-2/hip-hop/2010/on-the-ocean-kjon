[Intro]
Man
The moment I been waiting on
And my soul is over flowing
With anxieties and expectations
I'm full of desires
I just want it so bad
You know
And it just seem so real
It's right there
I just want reach out and touch it
Before it all disappears

[Verse 2]
Sometimes
It feels like
Everything is passing me by
Every now and then
It feels like (feels like)
My ship has gone and sailed away
But I
I gonna be strong (gotta be strong)
Gotta hold on
It won't be too long

[Chorus]
Now the tide is coming near
I see the waves flowing
Out there on the ocean
I know my ship is coming in
Just pass the horizon
And right where the sky ends
Cause out there on the ocean
Know my ship is coming in
But don't leave me hanging
I've been waiting to long
But this moment
My ship has finally come

[Verse 2]
I would travel to the seven seas
(I would even go)
I would even go wherever the wind blows me
(I'll do anything)
I'll do anything to find my destiny
It's like fightin' with gravity
And it's bringin' me down
If this world was really round then tell me how
It took so long for you to come around

[Chorus]
Now the tide is coming near
I see the waves flowing
Out there on the ocean
I know my ship is coming in (coming in baby)
Just pass the horizon
And right where the sky ends
Cause out there on the ocean
Know my ship is coming in
But don't leave me hanging
I've been waiting to long
But this moment
My ship has finally come

[Bridge]
Finally you come (around)
Around, around
I said finally baby
Finally you come (around)
Around, around
Finally you come around, come around baby
Finally you
Finally you come
Said finally you come around (around)

[Verse 3]
Now the tide is coming near (now the tide is coming in)
I see the waves flowing
Out there on the ocean
I know my ship is coming in (and I know my ship is coming in baby)
Just pass the horizon
(And where) And right where the sky ends
Cause out there on the ocean
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, is coming in
Been waiting to long
But this moment
My ship has finally come

Finally you come (around)
Around, around [till fade]
