[Verse 1]
Every now and then, i still get a flashback
Of the time i spent thinking you could be that one
Should i have just kept your love?
Yes i understand, we did have some good times on the
Other hand, got me crying all night. It was too much
For my mind

[Chorus]
So even though i left you, i can't forget you
Cause when i think about you (It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
Guess i'll always love you (It's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)
When we were together, you ain't treat me right. Damn i really
Love you, i ain't gonna lie. Cause when i think about you
(It's bittersweet)

[Verse 2]
I still have the box full of things you gave me
Start to throw it out, something always stops me, yeah
I'm not as over you as i say. Deep inside my heart, i made
The right decision. But it's kinda hard, when your mind is
Thinking of, did i make a big mistake?

[Chorus]

[Talking]
See, i don't understand. Like, somebody is gonna get hurt
Out of this situation and you just hope it's not you..
At times..

[Bridge]
Part of me wants you, part of me don't, part of me is
Missing you, part of me is gone. Part of me is saying that
The love is still strong. Part of me is letting go

[Chorus]
