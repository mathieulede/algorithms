I ain't hearin' you, that's not something he would do
He wouldn't take my heart and break it in two
I'm sure that he will explain and make it plain to me
I ain't hearin' you, that's not something he would do

I got a good man, even though he ain't perfect
They be hatin' him, tellin' me he ain't worth it
Tellin' me that he said and she said, when I still ain't leavin'
Instead of bringing me bad news, I'm telling you

I ain't hearin' you, that's not something he would do
He wouldn't take my heart and break it in two
I'm sure that he will explain and make it plain to me
I ain't hearin' you, that's not something he would do

I know he ain't blind, even I recognize beauty
Neither one of us minds, as long as they keep on movin'
Don't call me and disturb me 'cause I don't hear and I don't see
I hope that you're listening to me, misery gets no company

I ain't hearin' you, that's not something he would do
He wouldn't take my heart and break it in two
I'm sure that he will explain and make it plain to me
I ain't hearin' you, that's not something he would do

I ain't hearin' you, that's not something he would do
He wouldn't take my heart and break it in two
I'm sure that he will explain and make it plain to me
I ain't hearin' you, that's not something he would do

I ain't hearin' you, that's not something he would do
He wouldn't take my heart and break it in two
I'm sure that he will explain and make it plain to me
I ain't hearin' you, that's not something he would do
