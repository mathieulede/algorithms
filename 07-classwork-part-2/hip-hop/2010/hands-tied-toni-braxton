Listen
You askin me if I
Know what real love feels like
If I ever let anyone inside
It can't be serious (serious)
Cause I was the one giving all I had
I kept my promises all intact
For better or worse I honored that
I could show you all about love

Baby I can love you, love you, love you with my hands tied
I can please you, please you, please you with my hands tied
Everything you need is right here
It's just staring you in your face
Stop asking me if I'm ready
Cause this is just what I'll say
Cause I could love you, love you, love you
With my hands tied, my hands tied, my hands tied (hands tied)

Don't ever question my love
I love hard despite the
Heartbreaks, being left out
You see I've been around, been around
I was the one trying to patch it up
Now I watch it and say I've had enough
All of the best you're thinking of
I could show you all about love

Baby I can love you, love you, love you with my hands tied
I can please you, please you, please you with my hands tied
Everything you need is right here
It's just staring you in your face
Stop asking me if I'm ready
Cause this is just what I'll say
Cause I could love you, love you, love you
With my hands tied, with my hands tied, with my hands tied (hands tied)

Now I don't need my hands to feel the things I feel inside
Cause I know what's inside my heart is right
They don't have to hold you like that
They don't have to touch you like that
Cause you know the truth is that
I can love you with one hand tied behind my back

(hands tied, hands tied, hands tied...)
I can love you, baby...

Baby I can love you, love you, love you with my hands tied
I can please you, please you, please you with my hands tied
Everything you need is right here
It's just staring you in your face
Stop asking me if I'm ready
Cause this is just what I'll say
Cause I can love you, love you, love you (with my hands tied)
Cause I can love you, love you, love you
With my hands tied, hands tied, with my hands tied (hands tied)
