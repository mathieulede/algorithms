[Hook: Roscoe Dash]
And shawty we, all the way turnt up

All the way turnt up {ALL THE WAY, ALL THE WAY...}

[Roscoe Dash]
DJ turn me up, crank it to the max
I got lots of gwalla, I be blowing stacks
Polo on my hat, shoes and shirt that match
I be so turnt up, I be swagging to the max
If you get it in, and you getting dough
Gon' pop a bottle, this right here your song
Purple by the zone, you can smell it on my clothes
And it went up in my switch up, 'bout to take one to the dome
I'm gone, in another zone
I be riding on the engine, with the woofers goin' strong
They like "What is goin' on?" I don't really know
Then I roll down all my windows, and I crank this shit some mo'

[Hook]
And shawty we, all the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
{AND SHAWTY WE ALL THE WAY TURNT UP, ALL THE WAY TURNT UP}
All the way turnt up
{ALL THE WAY TURNT UP, ALL THE WAY TURNT UP}
All the way turnt up
{ALL THE WAY TURNT UP, ALL THE WAY TURNT UP}
All the way turnt up {ALL THE WAY, ALL THE WAY...}

[Soulja Boy]
Hopped up out the bed, what's happenin'?
Soulja Boy Tell 'em, turn them to my level man
Yeeaaah, money on the table
All up in Mexico, gettin' to the peso
Whoooa, check out the gear
If gettin' money was a sport, I'm MVP every year
We get' money over here, they must not know where I'm from
Yo girl spinnin' on my dick just like a CD-Rom
T-t-t-t-turn uuppp - turn up 'til you can't turn no' mo'
Burn up 'til you can't burn no' mo', rock my chain er'where I go
Smoke til you can't smoke no' mo', choke til you can't choke no' mo
Work til you can't work no' mo'; I'm rich I can't go broke no' mo'

[Hook]
And shawty we, all the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
{AND SHAWTY WE ALL THE WAY TURNT UP, ALL THE WAY TURNT UP}
All the way turnt up
{ALL THE WAY TURNT UP, ALL THE WAY TURNT UP}
All the way turnt up
{ALL THE WAY TURNT UP, ALL THE WAY TURNT UP}
All the way turnt up {ALL THE WAY, ALL THE WAY...}

[Roscoe Dash]
Turn up - all I know is turn up
Smoking like a hippie, I swear all I do is burn up
I'm in VIP and they be acting like they know us
I'm like free turn up, excuse me while I turn up
All these hoes be chosin', but I'm turnt up on the hoes
They way I turned up on the road I be turned up 'round the globe
All these niggas mad cause I be pulling all they hoes
Once I get 'em to the room they be turnt up out they clothes like
And I be goin' H.A.M
I don't think these niggas really know just who I am
Bitch it's R-O-S-C-O-E Dash and I get lots of cash
But for short you call me "Mr. Way-Too-Turnt-Up-For-That-Ass"
And I'm gone

[Hook]
And shawty we, all the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
{AND SHAWTY WE ALL THE WAY TURNT UP, ALL THE WAY TURNT UP}
All the way turnt up
{ALL THE WAY TURNT UP, ALL THE WAY TURNT UP}
All the way turnt up
{ALL THE WAY TURNT UP, ALL THE WAY TURNT UP}
All the way turnt up {ALL THE WAY, ALL THE WAY...}

[Outro: Soulja Boy]
All the way turnt up
Soulja Boy turnt up
Turn up (turn up), turn up (turn up)
Turn up (turn up), turn up (turn up)
All the way, all-all the way
All the way turnt up
Turn up, turn up
Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up...
