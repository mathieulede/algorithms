Butterflies is what I feel inside
And every time it's like my first time oo wee
And I can never find the words to say
You're the perfect girl
You're made for me
It's so easy to love you baby
We're compatible, incredible and natural we are
And girl I've never felt this way before
From the bottom of my heart
Baby girl I just wanna tell you that you are

The reason I love the reason I trust
God sent me an angel
You are the best in the world
A wonderful girl
Knowing you're by my side brings tears to my eyes

Baby
Girl you had me from the moment I looked into your eyes
And I knew you were an angel but you were in disguise
Tell me how can I be so lucky
That you'll fall down from heaven for me
Oo baby

Some people search a life time and never find a true love oo wee
Heaven care enough for me to give me you
And now our hearts can beat together
Standing strong girl here forever
You and I(you and I)
You and I (you and I)
I just want you to know that you're

The reason I love the reason I trust

God sent me an angel
You are the best in the world
A wonderful girl
Knowing you by my side and a man ain't supposed to cry

But girl you are
The only woman I'll make love to
You are
The reason I come home every night
Girl you are
You're all that I need in my life
It almost feel
It's not fair
Loving you oh damn
You are (you are)
You are

You are the reason I love the reason I trust
God sent me an angel
You are the best in the world
A wonderful girl (you're a wonderful girl)
Oh oh Oh
You are
(Baby you are) You all that I am
(you are) You all that I need
(you are) Baby heaven has sent you to me
(baby you are) The one for me
(you are) The air that I breathe

You are, you are everything to me baby
You're everything oh baby
Baby you are
Baby you are....
