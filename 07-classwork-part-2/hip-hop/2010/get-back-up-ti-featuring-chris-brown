[Intro: T.I. & Chris Brown]
I'm only, I'm only human dog, hello, out there
I'm only human dog, can you, hear me?
I'm only human dog, it's an S.O.S
Ay, ay listen to me, to let me, be me

[Hook: T.I. & Chris Brown]
Ay when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm only human y'all
Ay when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm just a human y'all
Push the dirt, off your jersey then go for the cup
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt, and the ring
People with you popping bottles, taking pictures, look around
But soon as you fall down all the haters passing judgement, oh no no)
Fly as I'm is shawty I'mma rise above this, oh no no no no

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey what it is world? Yeah it's me again
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No running from the truth, as much as we pretend
That it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends (I'm sorry)
For letting you down, I won't take you down this road again (uh-uh)
Most of you now saying "Whatever, here we go again"
Blogs, radio and television all going in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment (I gotta say)
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious (ha ha)
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou?
Point your finger now with me looking down (down)
Same clown that was Twitpicing at my wedding
On the same Twitter page disrespecting, wait a second
Never mind my imperfections, this a fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back

[Hook: T.I. & Chris Brown]
Ay when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm only human y'all
Ay when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm just a human y'all
Push the dirt, off your jersey then go for the cup
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt, and the ring
People with you popping bottles, taking pictures, look around
But soon as you fall down all the haters passing judgement, oh no no)
Fly as I'm is shawty I'mma rise above this, oh no no no no

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I admit, yeah I done some dumb shit, disappointed erry'body I know
Try not to hold that against me though
My road to redemption has no GPS
So guess that time must be invested for this to be manifested
Yes it's, hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
The Bible say "Let he without sin cast the stone first" (stone first)
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?
Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs up until the Fed
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead (damn)
Difference is my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to TMZ, the AJC and Wikipedia
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God ain't that what really matter? (nope)
And matter fact, I'm wrong but after that
The good I done in yo' hood, should it over-shadow that?
Got the world laughing at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with, even if you're so legit
That you get a house with a dog and a picket fence
The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this

[Hook: T.I. & Chris Brown]
Ay when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm only human y'all
Ay when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm just a human y'all
Push the dirt, off your jersey then go for the cup
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt, and the ring
People with you popping bottles, taking pictures, look around
But soon as you fall down all the haters passing judgement, oh no no)
Fly as I'm is shawty I'mma rise above this, oh no no no no

[Bridge: Chris Brown & T.I.]
Hello, out there, I'm only human dawg
