It's been a long time since I been up in your room
Such fun memories of makin' love to you
I see you got a new bed, you wanna break it in soon
Just two hours ago, you sang a different tune, said

You ain't gonna give in to me like that
No matter how much I'm wanting you and I respected you, baby
And now your tryin' to pull me while you're laying on your back
What am I gonna do? Can it stay?

Can it stay the way it was?
Say goodnight and only hug?
'Cause if we make love, we don't know what's to come
You're my only friend and I wanna keep you one

Can it stay the way it was?
Say goodnight and only hug?
'Cause if we make love, we don't know what's to come
You're my only friend and I wanna keep you one

Only hugs
Only, only hugs

I'm startin' to sweat and I'm losin' control
I think I should leave, don't need a robe
Now you wanna be a naughty girl, got me caught up in your naughty world
Baby

Stop, don't, stop, don't
Stop, baby, stop
I thought we moved on and we could be friends
But just lookin' at you makes me want you again

Can it stay the way it was?
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Say goodnight and only hug?
'Cause if we make love, we don't know what's to come
You're my only friend and I wanna keep you one
(I don't want to fuss and fight with you, baby)

Can it stay the way it was?
(The way it was yesterday)
Say goodnight and only hug?
(You know, when I didn't have to pay)
'Cause if we make love, we don't know what's to come
(For makin' good love to you)
You're my only friend and I wanna keep you one

Let's wait a while, don't move so fast
(Oh baby, please don't move so fast)
Girl, I miss you too, one more minute, girl, and I won't ask
(I miss you)
Been there before, you know me, I know you
(We been there, you know me, I know you)
Will there be regrets if we make love, what we gonna do?

Can it stay the way it was?
Say goodnight and only hug?
'Cause if we make love, we don't know what's to come
(Can we say goodnight, say goodnight to you, bye, bye, bye)
You're my only friend and I wanna keep you one
(Bye, bye, bye)

Can it stay the way it was?
(I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna break us up)
Say goodnight and only hug?
(I wanna stay in love, baby)
'Cause if we make love, we don't know what's to come
('Cause I know you and you know me)
You're my only friend and I wanna keep you one
(If we make love, to me what's it gonna be?)

(Only hugs)
Only hugs, that's all we need, that's all we need
But baby, you 'bout to make me, you 'bout to make me
(Only hugs)
Go down, go down on you
Go down on you, baby, only hugs, only hugs

Stop, hey, you said it wouldn't be like this
You said it wouldn't be like this, oh, oh
