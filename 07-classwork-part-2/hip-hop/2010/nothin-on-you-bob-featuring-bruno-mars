[Chorus (Condensed): Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby (Yeah)
Nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby
Na nothin' on you

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
(Go, go, go, go)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hey)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it

[Pre-Chorus 2: B.o.B]
I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)
Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)
But you always steal the show (Steal the show)
And just like that girl you got me froze (Got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well now you know
(Know, know, know, know)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hey)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Everywhere I go
I'm always hearin' your name
And no matter where I'm at
Girl you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane
Or a car or a train
No other girl's in my brain
And you the one to blame

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hello)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na na na nothin' on you, baby, na nothin' on you

[Outro: B.o.B]
Yeah, and that's just how we do it
Heheheh, and I'ma let this ride
B.o.B and Bruno Mars
