You're all I need
You're all I need

(Verse 1)
How can I ease your mind?
Baby, can I come and see you tonight?
Let me hold you, baby look into my eyes
So you can see
I'm down to be
The only man you'll ever need

(Chorus)
Girl, you're the one for me
I am down faithfully Yeah
All I really want
All I really need is you All I really need is you

Baby, girl you're the one for me
I am down faithfully
All I really want
All I really need is you

(Verse 2)
I can't be
Always right by your side
Trust me, you're always on my mind
Don't be, mislead by what others say
'Cause they don't love you like I do
Don't let them come between me and you

(Chorus)

(Bridge x2)
You're all I need
All I really want
All I really need is you, baby

(Verse 3)
I'll show and prove
You're the only one in my life
And if you're down
Then we can set this off tonight
I'll leave no doubt
About the lovin' I can give
Girl, ain't no need to trip on me
I'll leave no room for second guessing

(Chorus)

(Bridge x2)
You're all I need
All I really want
All I really need is you, baby

(Chorus x2)
(Breakdown x4)
You're all I need All I really want, all I really need

(Vamp)
You're all I need
Just a touch, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit
