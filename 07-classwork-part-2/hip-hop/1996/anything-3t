I'll give you love
The things you want
Ohhh... Ahh...
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
Sitting at home another lonely night
Wish you were here so I can hold you tight
Pain in my heart because I'm all alone
Why did you leave
Why did your love have to go
I would do anything for you
I would
Thinking of ways I could win your heart
But I'm so confused that I don't know where to start
Visions of love forever in my mind
I wait for the day that I can say that love is mine
'Cause I would do anything for you
Yes, I would
I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there is nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
So what can I do to prove that I need your love
What will it take because I won't give up
Open your heart and let your feelings show
'Cause deep down inside my heart just won't let you go
Girl, I would do anything for you
Yes, I would
I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there is nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
So if there every comes a time
When it is true love you hope to find
Just call out my name
And girl, that's when I would do anything
I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there is nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there is nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you
