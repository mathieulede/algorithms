[Intro]
Your love is wonderful, yeah
And I don't want to lose you
So baby...

[Hook] x2
Soon as I get home, I'll make it up to you
Baby, I'll do what I gotta do

[Verse 1]
Sleepless nights and lonely days are all that fill my head
All of the time, oh baby, but all I do
Is think about the way you make me feel
Cause baby, this love is so real

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
If I try to spend some time with you
To make you happy, would you feel better?
And if I could, with you I would be forever
Forever in love so

[Bridge]
Making love all through the night, we hold each other tight
I can take away the pain, if you would only let me
Just forget about the past
Cause I want to make it last, baby, I apologize
Cause boy, I really need you in my life!

[Hook] x2

Baby, if you give me just another chance
(Oh baby)
I can show you love
(More love)
Promise I'll be true to you
(You don't ever have to worry)
Don't ever have to worry
(No, no, no)
Cause I'm gonna treat you right
(Baby, I miss you)
Baby, I miss you, just want to kiss you
Hold you in my arms

[Hook until the song ends]
