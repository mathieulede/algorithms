[Verse 1:]
I know you're thinking
I've been better off without you by my side
But baby, this season
I don't want another cold rainy July

[Hook:]
You would think that I'd be better now
But I'm not
Cause I don't have you
You would think that I'd be better now
But I'm not
Cause I don't have you

[Chorus x2:]
Come back to the world
Come back to the world
Baby, back to my world

[Verse 2:]
And I still remember
The way you used to gently touch my face
And since last December
I've discovered that no one can take your place

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
And when the nights get lonely
I think of what you told me
Saying that I was the one

La, do, day
La, do, doh
La, do, day
La, do, doh

Tell me you can feel it once again
I know that we can love
Like we did then

So, bring it on home

[Repeat Chorus:]
