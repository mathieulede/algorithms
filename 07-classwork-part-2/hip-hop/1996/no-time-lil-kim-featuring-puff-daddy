[Puff Daddy]
Heh, heheheh
I got, no time for fake niggas
Just sip some Cristal with these real niggas
From East to West coast spread love niggas (that's right)
And while you niggas talk shit we count bank figures (say what?)

I got, no time for fake niggas (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Just sip some Cristal with these real niggas (uh-huh, uh-huh)
From East to West coast spread love niggas (that's right)
And while you niggas talk shit we count bank figures (he-heh)
1- ("How you figure that your team can effect my cream?" - B.I.G.)
I got, no time for fake niggas (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Just sip some Cristal with these real niggas (uh-huh, uh-huh)
2- ("I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die" - B.I.G.)
From East to West coast spread love niggas (ha hahh, that's right)
And while you niggas talk shit we count bank figures (let's go)

[Verse One: Lil' Kim]
Yeauhhh, I Momma, Miss Ivana
Usually rock the Prada, sometimes Gabbana
Stick you for your cream and your riches
Zsa Zsa Gabor, Demi Moore, Prince Diane and all them rich bitches
Puff Daddy pump the Hummer for the summer
I follow -- in the E-Class with the goggles
96 models, Bad Click on the stroll
(Tell em how we roll) Cruise control
Nuttin make a woman feel betta
Than Berrettas and Amarettas, butta leathers and mad cheddaz
Chillin in a Benz with my ami-gos
Tryin to stick a nigga for his pe-sos
If you say so's, then I'm the same chick
That you wanna get with, lick up in my twat
Gotta hit the spot, if not don't test the poom poom
Nanny nanny, punanny donny, heyyy!

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Heyyy, no time for fake niggas (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Just sip some Cristal with these real niggas (uh-huh, uh-huh)
From East to West coast spreadin love niggas (that's right)
And while you niggas talk shit we count bank figures (he heh)
1- ("How you figure that your team can effect my cream?" - B.I.G.)
I got, no time for fake niggas (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Just sip some Cristal with these real niggas (uh-huh, uh-huh)
2- ("I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die" - B.I.G.)
From East to West coast spreadin love niggas (that's right)
And while you niggas talk shit we count bank figures

[Verse Two: Puffy (Kim moaning in the background), Lil' Kim]
How you like it baby? Uhh, from the front
Uhh, from the back, give that ass a smack
Bet your man won't do it like that
Can't work the middle, plus his thing too little
Let me grab your ta-ta's, do the cha-cha
Work down your ta-ta's do the cha-cha
Make you scream Pa-pa
You da best, Da Da
Now watch mama, go up and down dick to jaw crazy
Uhh! Say my name baby (okay)
Before you nut, I'mma dribble down your butt cheeks
Make you wiggle, then giggle just a little
I'm drinkin babies, then I cracks for the Mercedes
Act shady, and feel my three-eighty *gun cocks*
Or the raven, oohwee I see
Your girl ain't a "Freak Like Me", or Adina
Huh, can't fade the rhinoceros of rap (say what?)
Lil' Kim pussy (uhh) how preposterous is that? (ha hah!)

[Chorus: Puff Daddy]
Got no time for fake niggas (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Just sip some Cristal with these real niggas (uh-huh, uh-huh)
From East to West coast spreadin love niggas (that's right)
And while you niggas talk shit we count bank figures (he heh)
I got, no time for fake niggas (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Just sip some Cristal with these real niggas (uh-huh, uh-huh)
From East to West coast spreadin love niggas (that's right)
And while you niggas talk shit we count bank figures (c'mon)

[Verse Three: Lil' Kim]
Uhh, right back at cha, the one Cleopatra (say what?)
Diggin in your stash
(Niggas think they gonna get some ass) No money money
No licky licky -- fuck the dicky dicky
And the quickie, gimme your loot
Your Mac-11 then shoot
Your game ain't sweet, John Paul peeps
Shouldn't compete, if you can't wet it, forget it
Don't sweat it, I bet it'd
Make ya cum smooth if you let it
Huh, you can't stop a bitch from ballin
Ha-ha to la-la to drive-by's they be callin, and you ain't know
While you be kickin that old shit (talk to me) we makin hits
Platinum and gold shit (we don't stop)
I stay draped in diamonds and pearls
Beside every man is a Bad Girl
(That's right... nine-six Bad Boy c'mon)
