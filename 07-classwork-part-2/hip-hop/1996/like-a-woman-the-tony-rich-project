I don't know, what I do to you
But I find myself at the East river, waiting to meet with you
Late at night, I keep dreaming of you
We're making love, on the sofa, that belongs to you

We fly higher than kites, when we're face to face
Searching for time, alone, in this here violent place
We don't know who we are, or why we've met
That is strangely good, in some sort of freakish way

The things we'll do, will make you feel like a woman
Falling in love, with a man she doesn't even know
The words we'll say, will send your mind on a journey
Looking for self-understanding, of the things we've done

Catch your breath; your heart beats too fast
You feel my presence, in your arms, will not last
I have an urge; I must kiss your hand
The first scent of this woman's fragrance, lies deep in my head

So we slit our wrists, and we join our blood
To symbolise, some type of, crazy oath
Sometimes it feels so wrong, but it could be good enough
To sacrifice our freedom for each other's hearts

The things we'll do, will make you feel like a woman
Falling in love, with a man she doesn't even know
The words we'll say, will send your mind on a journey
Looking for self-understanding, of the things we've done

The things we'll do, will make you feel like a woman
Falling in love, with a man she doesn't even know
The words we'll say, will send your mind on a journey
Looking for self-understanding, of the things we've done

The things we'll do, will make you feel like a woman
Falling in love, with a man she doesn't even know
The words we'll say, will send your mind on a journey
Looking for self-understanding, of the things we've done
