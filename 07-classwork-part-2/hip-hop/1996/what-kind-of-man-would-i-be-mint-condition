[Intro]
You know
We can't do this
We just can't
Listen

[Verse 1]
You say you feel disenchanted
Cause lately he takes you for granted
Still faithful and true you remained and
to hurt so have I
You pour out your heart and I listen
And we catch a vibe reminiscing
Temptations so strong not to mention
the yearning inside

[Hook]
But what kind of man would I be
If I lived unfaithfully
And what kind of girl would you be
If you did the same
Cause I don't wanna see her cry
And you don't need a reason to lie
Cause if we laid down tonight
It won't justify throwing love aside

[Verse 2]
This feeling is strong and we know it
But we gotta see past the moment
There's too much to lose if we blow it
this is no lie
Still here we are both together
With promises made that we never
Yet feeling it now more than ever
I can't deny

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Here we are all alone
But some how we've got to stay strong

[Hook]

[Outro]
Makes me wanna say oh
Just gotta say oh
She makes me wanna say oh
Just gotta say oh
But what kind of man would I be, oh I can't be unfaithful
Sorry baby
