This is how we roll
And were rolling like that
So honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(Champagne, caviar, and bubble bath)
This is how we do
And we do it like that so honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(Champagne, caviar, and bubble bath)

Have you ever been exposed
To the finer things
I can bring to life for you all these dreams, like
Parties with movie stars, ocean cruises, cavier
Champagne on ice, whatever you like
(just let your imagination flow)
Anyway you wanna roll
I'll bring you diamonds and pearls
Trips all around the world, girl
And when you're ready, girl i'll sex you just right
Cause we can stop for us
It's about time

This is how wer roll
And were rolling like that
So honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(Champagne, caviar, and bubble bath)
This is how we do
And we do it like that so honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(Champagne, caviar, and bubble bath)

Have you ever been aroused beyond control
Let me penetrate your body..mind and soul
Just lay back and let me soothe
Watch my body groove you
All through the night, I can make it so right
(let me kiss you from head to toe)
Anywhere you want me to go
I'll make you tremble inside
Take you so high
No other man can do
The things to you I can
So just relax and take my hand

This is how we roll
And were rolling like that
So honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(Champagne,caviar and bubble bath)
This is how we do
And we do it like that so honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(all through the night)
(Champagne,caviar and bubble bath)

This is how we roll
And were rolling like that
So honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(Champagne,caviar and bubble bath)
This is how we move
And we do it like that
(don't you worry about a thing)
So honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(Champagne,caviar and bubble bath)

Ya know what I'm sayin'

Yeah, yeah, c'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh
This is how we roll
Barrio and we do it like this

Crusin lately by the heights
Rollin dice now it's champagne on ice
Time i sacrifice, call it deja vous
But when i first freak you
Peep you, greet you, sweet 5 and got live
Things you ain't seen or never saw
Land cruisers, 4x4 i'll take you for a tour
Fat roll my bank account swole
Relax your mind and soul
Say yeah won't you sing

This is how we roll
And were rolling like that (baby)
So honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(this is how we do, this is how we do)
(Champagne, caviar and bubble bath)
This is how we do
And we do it like that so honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(Champagne,caviar and bubble bath)

This is how we roll (this is how we roll)
And were rolling like that (ain't no doubt about it)
So honey's come in (this is how I move)
Kick off your shoes and lay back (this is what I do)
(Champagne,caviar and bubble bath)
This is how we do (said whatever you want)
And we do it like that so honey's come in
Kick off your shoes (whatever you need baby)
And lay back (I can give you everything you need
(Champagne,caviar and bubble bath)

This is how we roll
And were rolling like that
So honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back

This is how we do
And we do it like that so honey's come in
Kick off your shoes and lay back
(Champagne,caviar and bubble bath)
