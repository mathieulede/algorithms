[Verse 1]
There's something I know I should have told you
Something that's growing everyday
Whether or not, I say it a lot
I'm down with you in every single way
Gonna be days when you are lonely
And people will say they got no time (no time)
When you're alone, call me on the phone
Baby, you always got mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the wind blows
Baby, don't cry, just remember my words

[Chorus 1]
Baby love, gentle as raindrops falling in June
Pretty as sunshine and flowers in bloom
Baby love, as long as you're happy, I'm happy too
It's a delight, you're in my life

[Bridge 1]
Baby love
Baby love

[Verse 2]
You got a glow that just surrounds you
When I'm with you, I'm shining bright
Honey, it's true, I love the way you do
And I could tell you every night
You're so lovely when you're laughing
It makes my day to see you smile
Didn't you know, when you played in the snow
You set my winter on fire

[Pre-Chorus]
And when the wind blows
Baby, don't cry, just remember my worlds

[Chorus 2]
Baby love, gentle as raindrops falling in June
Pretty as sunshine and flowers in bloom
Baby love, as long as you're happy, I'm happy too
It's a delight God in my life

[Bridge 2]
Baby love
Ooh, baby love
Baby, baby

[Chorus 1 (4x)]
Baby love, gentle as raindrops falling in June
Pretty as sunshine and flowers in bloom
Baby love, as long as you're happy, I'm happy too
It's a delight, you're in my life

[Outro (until fade)]
Baby love
