I'm writing this letter to say what's on my mind
First, how are you doing. I hope you and the kids are all right
Wish I could be there, but can't be
So, give a hug and a kiss from me

Been thinking about us, and why we are apart
Though I have my reasons, I just don't know where to start
All I know is I keep breaking your heart
And all, that I can say is that I'm Sorry

(Sorry, I)
Can't give you all the love you need and I'm
(Sorry, I)
The man you wanted I can't be, yeah
(Sorry, I)
Is all that I can say girl
I'm so sorry, I can't make it right

When you say that you love me, I feel it's really true but
In the room there is silence, when I don't say those words back to you
There's no denying the truth
I've fallen out of love with you

There's no need in trying to
Save the love we made, cause
Inside we're dying, and we can't continue this way
It's too heavy the price that we'll have to pay
Soooooo.... IIIII'm ...

(Sorry, I)
So Sorry, I Can't give you all the love you need and I'm So Sorry
(Sorry, I)
The man you wanted I can't be, yeah IIIII...
(Sorry, I)
Is all that I can say girl
I'm so sorry, that I can't make it right

Who'd ever thought that love would hurt this deep inside
I never dreamed I'd walk away from the love of my life
But something's wrong girl and I..I can't pretend anymore
I did the best I could to hold on, ohhhh ... oh I'm

(Sorry, I)
Sorry I i didn't mean to hurt you naw
(Sorry, I)
I didn't mean to desert you, naw
(Sorry, I)
Sorry I couldn't be all the things you needed me to be

Oh I, oh I'm sorry that I
(Sorry, I)
Couldn't give you all the things you needed from another girl I'm Sorry
