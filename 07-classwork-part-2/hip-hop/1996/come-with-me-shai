[Verse 1:]
I got a call
A telephone call today
Somebody’s offering a job
A thousand miles away
And I want to take it

It’s the opportunity of a lifetime
But I need a second opinion
An opinion other than mine

So I
I’m turning to you
Because you always seem to know what to do
When times like these arrive
I call on my only true friend in the world
My girl

[Chorus:]
So I
I want to know
If you really want me to go
And if so
Are you coming with me?

I
I want to know
Should I really, really go
And if so
Come with me

I never wanted anything as much
As I want you with me
You were the one who said to follow my dreams

Of having a house
A car
A view of the stars
And a beautiful wife
So I need someone I can go with
I need some love in my life

[Repeat Chorus:]
