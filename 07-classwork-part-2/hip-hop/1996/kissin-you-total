Kissin' you is all that I been thinking of
Kissin' you is ooh....ooh

[Verse 1/Keisha]

I don't care who sees me
And thinking about you makes my life complete
And what I mean by that

You make me feel things that I never felt
I wanna kiss you

[Verse 2/Pam]
When I'm with my friends
I'm trying to figure out a way
To leave 'em behind just to get back to you

And that's the way I like it
You're my pride and joy boy
That's why I'm dreaming of you
I wanna kiss you
