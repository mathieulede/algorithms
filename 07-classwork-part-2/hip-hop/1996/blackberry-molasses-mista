Blackberry Molasses
One of the things that never change
You gotta keep pushin on
The sun dont rain all the time
Theres gonna be some heart ache
And pain

Woke up Sunday morning
Gotta little bad news today...ummm
They say my life ain't worth living
And time is slowly ticking away
Dont think that Im goin crazy
Cause thought be runnin through my head
I know I gotta be strong
Gotta hold on
Sometimes Id rather give up instead
Seems like Im better off dead

Blackberry Molasses
One of the things that never change
You gotta keep pushin on
The sun dont rain all the time
Theres gonna be some heart ache
And pain

Dont tell me how to live my life
After all that we've been through
Dont wanna hear about your hardships
Cause Ive been there myself
A time or two
Still life goes on
If you just keep holding on
So many things to survive
Once you realize
Theres no such place as paradise
At least in my eyes

Blackberry Molasses
One of the things that never change (never change)
You gotta keep pushin on
The sun dont rain all the time (no)
Theres gonna be some heartache
And pain (heartache and pain)

Blackberry Molasses (black)
One of the things that never change (never change)
You gotta keep pushin on
The sun dont rain all the time(no)
Theres gonna be some heartache
And pain (heart)
