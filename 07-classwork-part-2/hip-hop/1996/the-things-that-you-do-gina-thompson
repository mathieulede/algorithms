It's the things that you do
That makes me keep running to you
Keep on loving me the way you love me
'cause in love is where I ought to be

What I feel inside I can not deny
It feels good to have in my life, oh yeah
Why I fell this way I can not explain
But your love has taken over me, oh yeah
You give more than a typical good lovin'
What you got is more than I ever wanted
So, Please don't stop, keep it right there in my baby
So, I'm gonna do to you what no other lady can do

It's the things that you do
That makes me keep running to you
Keep on loving me the way you love me
'cause in love is where I ought to be

If love is wrong I don't wanna do right no more
'cause I love you with all my heart
What I ask of you,to keep doing what you do
When you do the things you do
I don't need nobody else but you
Please don't go
Please don't go nowhere 'cause you don't know
You just don't know how much I care
That's why I love you so
I love you more and more each day
All I do is pray that you don't never go away

It's the things you do that make me keep running to you
Keep on loving me the way you love me
'cause in love is where I ought to be

It's the things you do that make me keep running to you
Keep on loving me the way you love me
'cause in love is where I ought to be

It's the things that you do that make me keep running to you
Keep on loving me the way you love me
'cause in love is where I ought to be

It's the things that you do that make me keep running to you
Keep on loving me the way you love me
'cause in love is where I ought to be
