[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go (please don't go)
Stay right by my side (by my side)

[Verse 1]
Rainy days
Brings back memories of you
And I will never lie
I want you by my side
Thinking of you
Makes me really not want you to go
Please stay
Stay with me

[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go (please don't go)
Stay right by my side (by my side)

[Verse 2]
Oh, I can't change the fact
That I want you in my life
Don't go
My heart's not strong
Now all I see
To you, you are my friend
Don't leave
I'll do anything

[Pre-Chorus]
These rainy days bring back memories
These rainy days bring back memories
These rainy days bring back memories
Of you
These rainy days bring back memories
These rainy days bring back memories
These rainy days bring back memories
Of you

[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go (please don't go)
Stay right by my side (by my side)

[Bridge]
These rainy days bring back memories (please don't go)
These rainy days bring back memories (stay right by my side)
These rainy days bring back memories (by my side)
Of you (stay right by my side)
These rainy days bring back memories (please don't go)
These rainy days bring back memories (stay right by my side)
These rainy days bring back memories (by my side)
Of you

[Chorus]
Baby, please don't go (please don't go)
Stay right by my side (by my side)
Baby, please don't go
Stay right by my side
Stay right by my side
Stay right by my side
Stay right by my side (please don't go)
Stay right by my side
