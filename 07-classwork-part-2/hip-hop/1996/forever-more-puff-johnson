When you close your eyes
I hope you think of me
Just say the word
And I will be there for you
No need to hesitate
My love will be here always-0h

Forever more
You will be what l'm living for
And deep in my heart
There's a light that shine
Just for you and only you
Forever more, forever more

When you need a friend
I'll be there till the end
Come rain or shine
I'll be standing by your side
L'll never turn away, my love
Will be here always, oh

Forever more
You will be what l'm living for
And deep in my heart
There's a flam that burns
Just for you and only you

Forever more you will be what
I'm longing for and deep in my soul
There's a light that shine
Just for you and only you
Forever more, forever more

Never felt this way before, until you
Made sweet love to me, oh baby
Your the one my heart adores
The only man I need- forever more

Forever more you will be what
I'm longing for and deep in my soul
There's a light that shine
Just for you and only you
Forever more, forever more
