[Chorus:]
Why'd you think that I
Would sit here and wait in vain?
Baby, I'm movin' on
'Cause what I want from love
Is the pleasure and not the pain
Baby I'm movin' on

[Verse 1:]
Didn't I hear you say
That your love would never change
But I know that it's over
But when the story ends
Why should we both pretend
When we know there's another

[Pre-Chorus:]
Tell me how, tell me who
Just tell me the truth
Tell me why did you lie
I can see it in your eyes
Tell me where, tell me when
Cause it never should have been at all
But it looks like it's over

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I remember when
When I was there for you
Where were you last winter?
Cause the thoughts run through my mind
Of all the times you lied
And that's why it's over

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
How could you do this to me?
'Cause now I gotta leave
Why did you tell me those lies?
And now I gotta say bye bye
Bye bye, baby yeah

[Chorus]

Where'd we go wrong?
Now, you left me all alone
Hey, but it's alright 'cause I'm movin' on
Yes I am
Baby, I'm movin' (baby, I'm movin')
Baby, I'm movin' (baby, I'm movin')
Baby, I'm movin', movin', oh, baby I am movin' on
Baby I am...
