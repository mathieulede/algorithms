I think I must be dreaming
That you are here with me
Must have died and gone to heaven
And it's all that I hoped it would be

When the eagles forget how to fly
And it's twenty below in July
And when violets turn red
And roses turn blue
I'll be still in love with you

I live to be around you
You take my breath away
Can't help but talk about you
Every night and day

And when eagles forget how to fly
When it's twenty below in July
And when violets turn red
And roses turn blue
I'll be still in love with you

All I need is you
Need you just to hold me, console me
Over and over,...I Love You...
