[Verse 1]
You've been
Missing
Out on all the chances you've been given
Is it something
Within
Holding you back instead of living?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your day is coming though it seems far
Things will be clear when you love who you are
Nothing can stop you as long as you listen to your heart

[Chorus (2x)]
Lift your head to the sky and keep trying
Believe in you, and it will take you higher

[Verse 2]
You have
Sorrows
Everywhere you turn they seem to follow
If you
Let go
Happiness will come to you tomorrow

[Pre-Chorus]
Your day is coming though it seems far
Things will be clear when you love who you are
Nothing can stop you as long as you listen to your heart

[Chorus (2x)]
Lift your head to the sky and keep trying
Believe in you, and it will take you higher

[Bridge]
Oh
Yeah
Yeah, baby
Oh, ho-oh-oh
Oh
You can make it if you try, you can make it

[Chorus (until fade)]
Lift your head to the sky and keep trying
Believe in you, and it will take you higher
