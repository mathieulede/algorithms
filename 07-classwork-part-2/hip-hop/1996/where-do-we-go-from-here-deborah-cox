[Verse 1:]
When you're in love
Some things you take
For granted until someone
Pulls it apart
And leaves you with half of your heart

How do I trade the best
I have for less without giving up
Should I slowly accept
That we'll be no more than just friends

How do I know
When to let go?
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try
So tell me

[Chorus:]
Where do we go from here?
Why's my heart filled with so much fear?
When all that you are is
All I need and more

[Verse 2:]
There's no winning this
The battle's just begun
I know it's over
But I still feel the same
You'll always remain number one

'Cause letting go
Warrants so much
I know what I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try
So tell me

[Repeat Chorus x2]

[Bridge:]
Letting go
Warrants so much
I know what
I'm feeling inside
But part of me still wants to try

[Repeat Chorus]
