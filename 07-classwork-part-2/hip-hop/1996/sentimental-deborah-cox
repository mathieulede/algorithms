[Verse 1:]
I used to mess around
But I never let it get into me
'Cause I didn't take you serious, baby

Now to be without your love
Only makes me realize
What I could've had in you, honey

Now that you're gone
(Oooooooh ooooh ooooh)
I want you more

I said
It slapped me in my face
And then my friends don't understand
Because I had the chance
I don't know why

[Chorus:]
I'm going crazy alone in a daze
And my heart ain't the same
And I don't even think unless
I think about you

That's the only time
I get sentimental
That's the reason why baby
I can't let go of you
Yeah, that's the only time
I get sentimental

[Verse 2:]
I miss you day and night
Seems like you're still here
I'd rather be together, honey

Now that I'm lost for words
I can't believe I'm on my own
I should've been looking at love

Now that you're gone
I want you
(Oooh ooh oooh)

I said it slapped me on my face
And now my friends don't understand
Because I had the chance
I don't know why

[Repeat Chorus x2]

[Bridge:]
Now that you're gone
I want you more
I said it slapped me on my face

And then my friends don't understand
Because I had the chance
I don't know why

[Repeat Chorus x2]
