[Intro]
You know it's taken me a long time, baby, to realize
How much you mean to me, I don't wanna lose you

[Verse 1]
Times are hard, my spirits are weak, oh yeah
Everything seems to be going wrong, outlook's bleak
You know I fooled around playing the field
That's when I found that your love was real
No, I haven't treated you so right
But I won't lose your love without a fight

[Chorus]
I'm going to hold on to the love we have together
Hold on, don't you say goodbye
Tell me now before we lose forever
Girl, I don't want to lose you

[Verse 2]
Girl, I've got to have your sweet loving
'Cause without it, girl, I'll just lose my mind
The way you hold me comforts me and shows me
That a love like yours is hard to find
I need your loving every day and night
Your kinda loving makes me feel alright

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Baby, don't go, baby don't go, not now
Baby, don't go, I need you by my side girl, yeah
Baby, don't go, I love you so
And I don't want to lose you

[Verse 3]
You know it took me a long time to finally realize
That a good thing is hard to find
That's why I'm standing right here with you today, girl
I want to keep you forever, I've come to my senses, girl, you know
I don't want to go anywhere, I'm coming home

[Chorus] [x2]

[Outro]
I don't want to lose you, baby
Don't want to lose you now, I need you
