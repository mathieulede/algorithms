It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You we're content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind
See, I was the one with all the glory
While you we're the one with all the strength, yes, you were
Only a face without a name
I never once heard you complain, no
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I would like to be
I could fly higher than an eagle, yeah, yeah
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings
It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But daddy, daddy, daddy, I've got it all
Right here in my heart, yes, I do say
And I want you to know, I know the truth
I know you know the truth about it
I would be nothing, nothing without you, you, you
Did you ever know, you're my hero? Yeah, yeah
You're everything I would like to be
I could fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath the old man's wings
You are the wind beneath my wings, my wings
See, daddy I remember you we're
On the stage singing your song, singing your song, now
That's why I used to take you and your brothers on the road
I used to, I used to carry y'all along
But now I'm proud we can stand up here
And sing it together now, hey, yeah
It's so good to see your dreams come true
Right here and right now, right now
It might have appeared to go unnoticed, unnoticed
But, son I've got it all right here in my arms, in my arms, in my heart
I want you to know that I know the truth, yes, I do, yes, I do
I would be nothing daddy, nothing, zero, zero without you, without you
Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I would like to be
I could fly higher than an eagle
'Cause you are the wind beneath your daddy's wings
You are the wind beneath your little son's wings, wings
