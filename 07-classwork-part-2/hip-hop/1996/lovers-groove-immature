[Chorus (2x)]
The feeling's on to the break of dawn
The party's on lover's groove

[Verse 1: Romeo]
Let me take you on a ride
To a place where the ladies freak yo mind
Only Romeo knows where the honeys go
And I got the freak of the week
So let me take you to the love land
Where the feeling's right and the girls look tight
'Cause there's nothing else to do on this crazy filled night
Nothing else to do on this crazy filled night

[Verse 2: Batman]
The sun is shining
The girls are fly, all the lovers around, well well
Everybody's on the street doing the freak
Baby, freak with me in the lovers land

[Chorus (2x)]
The feeling's on to the break of dawn
The party's on lover's groove

[Verse 3: Romeo]
So I'm feeling high, right?
I got the vibe, you got the vibe
(Freaks come out at night)
So get your groove on, party all night long
So I got the freak with the big ol' butt
I got nothing but love for you, baby
So let's ride
To the lover's groove

[Verse 4: Batman]
The beat is creeping, real fly flavor
A crazy, crazy vibe, all the lovers out tonight, well well
Bodies shaking, love making
To the lover's groove, where you can kick it

[Chorus (2x)]
The feeling's on to the break of dawn
The party's on lover's groove

[Bridge: LDB]
Yeah, LDB's kicking it the lover's lane, yeah
With the lovers, in the lover's groove, unh, yeah
This how we do it, unh
Yeah, with all the lovers in the lover's lane, yeah

[Chorus (4x)]
The feeling's on to the break of dawn
The party's on lover's groove

[Outro]
Lover's groove
