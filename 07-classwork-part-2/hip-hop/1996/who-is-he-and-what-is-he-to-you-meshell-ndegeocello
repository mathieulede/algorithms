A man we passed just tried to stare me down
And when I looked at you
You looked at the ground
I don't know who he is but I think that you do
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?
I have something in my heart and in your eyes
Tell me, he's not someone just passin' by
And when you cleared your throat, was that your cue?
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?
Now when I add the sum of you and me
And I get confused and I keep coming up with three
You're too much for one man but not enough for two
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?
Well you tell me man don't have much intuition
Is that what you're really thinkin' [incomprehensible]
Or are you wishin'?
Before you wreck your old home, be certain of the new
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?
Dag gummit dag
Who is he and what is he to you?
