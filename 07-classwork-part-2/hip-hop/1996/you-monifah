Chorus
And if the sun don't shine you brigten up my day
And if the rain should fall it never seems to fall my way
And when it's cold outside you're there to keep me warm
Those days i'm feeling weak you make me feel so strong

(Mo)
You seem to bring out the best in me
Now my heart can sing cuz you make me so happy
No one else will do no they won't do the things you do for me yeah
Baby baby babyyy hayyyy heeee

Baby you blow my mind (you blow my mind)
Every day and night
You got me paralized
You make me feel so good inside

Chorus

Never had I felt a love so strong
To stand the test of time (tell me)
How could I go on if you took your love away
So far away there would only be cloudy days
Baby baby babyyy hayyy heee

Baby you blow my mind
Everyday and night you got me paralized
You make me feel so good inside ohh oh oh oh

Chorus
And if the sun don't shine you brighten up my day
And if the rain should fall it never seems to fall my way
And when it's cold outside you're there to keep me warm
Those days i'm feeling weak you make me feel so strong

Break
If the sun don't shine you brighten up my day
And if the rain should fall (if it should ever fall don't worry baby)
And if it's cold outside you're there to keep me warm
And if i'm feeling weak (if i'm feeling weak ohh oh oh oh )

Chorus

If it should fall fall my way yeah
Don't you know don't you know don't you know

Reapeat break untill fade
