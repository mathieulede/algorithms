Unks:
'Moving out to you, now'
'Ah, I don't hear it'
'Hold it right there'
'I'm holding'

Spoken:

Say, man!
Don't walk ahead of that woman
Like she don't belong to you
Just 'cause her got them little skinny legs
You know that ain't no way to do

You didn't act like that when ya had it home
Behind closed do's!
Alright

Now, you act like you ashamed of the woman
Don't even want nobody to know she's yo's
But that's, alright
You just walk on, baby!
(hup, hup)
H'uh!
And don't you worry about a doggone thing, a'tol
(hup, hup)
Because there's some man, somewhere
Who'll take you
Baby, skinny legs and all

'I swear!'
Keep on walkin', baby
(Hup, hup)
Show ya what I'm talkin' about

Listen to this:

Now, who'll take the woman with the skinny legs?
(Try, Leroy)
Stand right there baby, I'm 'on give you away
In a minute

Come on, somebody please take the lady with
The skinny legs?
(I don't 'wan 'em!)

Now, ya'all know the lady with skinny legs
Got to have somebody too, now
(No, I don't wanna help that person!)

Will somebody, please take the lady with
The skinny legs, please?

(Ay, Joe!)
Yeah, Bobby
(Why don't you take her?)
She ain't no fool!
I don't want no woman with no skinny legs

Look here!

I thought about givin' this woman to Clyde
But, no
Say, I know the kind-a women Clyde like
Ol' Leroy'll take her
Say, LEROY!
You got her!

Say, Miss Sweetie
Now, why you wan' act like that man
Ain't yo's?
Just 'cause he's walkin' with you
With them raggedy clothes?
Man just forgot to get his suit outta the cleaners
That's all

Alright!
Alright!

Ya act like that man don't belong to ya
Go on over there and kiss 'em and
Hold his hand
Unk: 'Go over there and squeeze your man'
Unk man: 'I'd like to have her squeeze my hand'
Uh!
Say you ain't gon' do what?
Unk: 'I likes it'
(Unk man w/woman-like voice) 'I say later, ho'
'That's alright
You just walk on, mister!
(Thank you, you're welcome!)

And don't you worry about a doggone thing a'tol
(Hup, Hup)
Because there's some woman
Somewhere, who'll take you
Mr. Raggedy Clothes and all

Yes they will
Just keep on walkin'
(Hup, Hup)

H'uh!

(Hup, Hup)

H'uh!

(Hup, Hup)

Don't be ashamed a-what you got

(Hup, Hup)
(Hup, Hup)

Just sayin', what girl's that you dropped wouldn't tell you
