I Ain't Got To Love Nobody Else
I Ain't Got To Love Nobody Else
I Got You
If the whole world turned it's back on me
I wouldn't lose a thing, oh no
Because I've got my baby
And to me the girl means every-everything, yeah
I Ain't Got To Love Nobody Else
I Ain't Got To Love Nobody Else
I Got You
Don't need no friends
I don't need no friends at all

(Chorus: she's my baby and I love her)
'Cause when I'm down
Yours is the only name I know to call

(Chorus: she's my baby and I need her)
I Ain't Got To Love Nobody Else
I Ain't Got To Love Nobody Else
I Got You
If the 10 most beautiful women in the world
If they wanted me
I'd have to say no
Cause I belong to my baby
I Ain't Got To Love Nobody Else
I Ain't Got To Love Nobody Else
Don't you know, I Ain't Got To Love Nobody Else...
