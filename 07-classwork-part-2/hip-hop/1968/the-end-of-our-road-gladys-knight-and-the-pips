It's over, it's all over
Said it's over, it's all over baby
I've gotta get away from you fast as I can
Oh you're too much for me woman
More than my heart could stand
Like a kid behind the wheel
You been reckless with my heart
If I stay around you sure to tear it all apart
Said the road's got to end somewhere, honey honey
Every road's got to end somewhere
Now is the time for the showdown
So let me give you the low down
Oh we've come to the end of our road

Just think about all the times you promised to call
I sat home lonely
You only did it cause you know I loved you only
Runnin', runnin', 'round with every guy in town
I'm telling you woman no longer will I be your clown

Said the road's got to end somewhere
Every road has got to end somewhere
Well I'm tired of your stuff
Said enough is enough
We've come to the end of our road
I can't take it no more
You made more sense when you begged and you pleaded
Talkin' bout I'm the one you're needing
Said I done had my fill of you
Then you told me the end
I just broke up running out of tears
Tell you I couldn't cry if I wanted to
The road's got to end somewhere

Every roads got to end somewhere
Time and again I begged you to slow down
So I'm giving you the love down
We've come to the end of our road
Bye, bye, bye baby
