There's a track winding back to an old fashioned shack
Along the road to Gundagai
Where the blue gums are growing, the Murrumbidgee's flowing
Beneath that sunny sky
Where my Mummy and Daddy are waiting for me
Where the pals of my childhood are waiting for me
So no more will I roam till I'm headed right for home

On the road to Gundagai

There's an old fashioned Ford made of rubber, tin and board
Along the road to Gundagai
The radiator's hissing, and half the engine's missing
The oil tank's running dry
There's water in the petrol and sand in the gears
And it hasn't seen a garage for more than twenty years
But O lord hear the roar when the pedal hits the floor
Along the road to Gundagai
