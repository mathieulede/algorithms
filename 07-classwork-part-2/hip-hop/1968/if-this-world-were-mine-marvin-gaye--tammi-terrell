[Verse 1]
[M:]
If this world were mine, I'd place at your feet
All that I own; you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
For with your love inside me, that would be all I need

[Chorus]
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything

[Verse 2]
[T:]
If this world were mine, I'd make you a king
With wealth untold, you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
[M:] Oh baby, you're my consolation
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, honey, just call me
[T:] And honey, you're my inspiration
And there's so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me

[Bridge]
[M:] And the sky would be blue
As long as you're loving me
[T:] With you here in my arms
Life is so wonderful

[Outro]
[Both:]
Give me pretty loving, baby
Give me pretty loving, honey
Keep on loving me
You know I need you, baby
Really, really need you, baby
