I said it wasn't long ago
I was doin' real good
Don't you know my baby was acting
Like a sweet girl should

But she found another
Whoa Lord, and I got the news
And now I'm here suffering
From a touch of the blues

My friends say I look bad
And I guess they are right
I can't eat or sleep, no, no, baby
I toss and turn all night

My eyes are all red
Whoa Lord, and I'm dragging my shoes
But I'm not really worried, no, no, baby
It's just a touch of the blues, I said, it's a touch of the blues

I went to see my doctor
But he said I was alright
I didn't get a prescription, no, no, baby
Just some good advice

He said to forget you
Whoa Lord, and stop being your fool
If you wanted to lose
Oh oh, this touch of the blues

Oh, I guess time will ease
This pain in my heart
Then I'll find a new lover, baby
Oh Lord, and make a brand new start

Then I'll hope that she'll love me
Oh Lord, and always be true
And don't leave me here suffering, yeah
With a touch of the blues

And I don't want you to leave me here, baby
Oh Lord, I don't want you to leave here stuck with my baby
