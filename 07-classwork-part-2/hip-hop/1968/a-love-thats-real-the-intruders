Jack went up the hill for Jill
To get her a pail of water
To show her that he loved her
(Ooh, he loved her)
He really, really loved her
(Ooh, he loved her)

Romeo told Juliet
Something that she could never forget
To show he loved her
(Ooh, he loved her)
He really, really loved her

Whoa, [Incomprehensible] in a storybook
A play of fantasy
They could never compare
With the love between you and me

Because we got a love we can feel
We got a love that's really real
We got a love we can feel
We got a love that's really real

He was such a determined fella
He searched all over for Cinderella
To show he loved her
(Ooh, he loved her)
He really, really loved her
(Ooh, he loved her)

Mary's lamb was white as snow
He followed her wherever she'd go
To show he loved her
(Ooh, he loved her)
He really, really loved her

Whoa, [Incomprehensible] in a storybook
A play of fantasy
They could never compare
With the love between you and me

Because we got a love we can feel
We got a love that's really real
We got a love we can feel
We got a love that's really real
