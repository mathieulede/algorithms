The closer you get
The better you look, Baby
The better you look
The more I want you
When you turn on your smile
I feel my heart go wild
I'm like a child with a brand new toy

CHORUS
And I get the sweetest feeling
Honey the sweetest
Sweetest feeling
Baby the sweetest
Sweetest feeling
Loving you

The warmer your kiss
The deeper you touch me, Baby
The deeper your touch
The more you thrill me
It's more than I can stand
Girl, when you hold my hand
I feel so grand that I could cry

CHORUS

The greater your love
The stronger you hold me, Baby
The stronger your hold
The more I need you
With every passing day
I love you more in every way
I'm in love to stay
And I want to say

CHORUS
