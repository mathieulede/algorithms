[Chorus]
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

[Verse 1]
For five long years
I thought you were my man
But I found out
I'm just a link in your chain
You got me where you want me
I am nothing but your fool
Ya treated me mean
Oh you treated me cruel

[Chorus]
Chain, chain, chain
(Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

[Verse 2]
Every chain, has got a weak link
I might be weak yeah
But I'll give you strength
Oh, hey
You told me to leave you alone
My father said, "Come on home"
My doctor said, "Take it easy"
Oh but your loving is much too strong
I'm added to your

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
One of these mornings
The chain is gonna break
But up until the day
I'm going to take all I can take, oh hey

[Chorus] [x2]
