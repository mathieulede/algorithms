Baby, here I am
I'm a girl on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you got to come home with me

I've got some good old loving
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwing it on you
You got to come back for more

Girls and things will come by the dozen
That ain't nothing but drugstore loving
Pretty little thing
Let me light your candle
Cause, baby, I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am

Actions speak louder than words
And I'm a girl with a great experience
I know you got another girl
But I can love you better than she can

Take my hand, don't be afraid
I want to prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free
So won't you place your ad with me

Girls and things will come by the dozen
That ain't nothing but ten cent loving
Groovy little thing
Let me light your candle
Cause, baby, I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am

Baby, here I am
I'm a girl on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you got to come home with me

I've got some good old loving
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwing it on you
You got to come back for more

Girls and things will come by the dozen
But that ain't nothing
But ten cent loving
Pretty little thing
Let me light your candle
Cause, baby, I'm sure hard to handle now
Yes, I am

Hey, give it to me
I got to have it
Good old loving

Hey, said give it to me
I got to have it
Good old loving

Hey, said here I am
Hey, I got to have it...
