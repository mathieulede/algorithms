[Verse]
Sunshine blue skies please go away
The girl has found another and
Gone away
With her went my future
My life is filled with gloom
So day after day I stay locked up in my room
I know to you, it might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
Because so badly I want to go outside
But everyone knows
That a man isn't supposed to cry
Listen, I got to cry because crying eases the pain
Oh yeah, people this hurt I feel inside
Words could never explain
I just wish it would rain
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain
(I just wish it would rain)
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain

Day in day out my tear-stained face
Pressed against the window pain
My eyes search the skies desperately for rain
Because rain-drops will hide my tear -drops
And no one will ever know that I'm crying
Crying when I go outside
To the world outside my tears
I refuse to explain
Oh I wish it would rain
Let it rain, let it rain
I need rain to disguise the tears in my eyes
Oh, let it rain
I'm a man and I got my pride
Till it rains I'm going to stay inside and let it rain
