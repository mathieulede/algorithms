Oh baby you, you got what I need
You got everything I need
You're like medicine to me
Oh baby

In a world of salty tears
So afraid and so full of fears
So glad you saved me, dear
(Saved me dear)
You're the sunshine to my life
Things were wrong, you made them right
How did you do it dear
I'm thankful every day that you came my way
And I hope and pray that you'll never ever go away

Cause you, oh, you got what I need, little girl
You got everything I need
You're like medicine to me
Oh baby
You got it

I was drowning in the sea of love
Going down for the third time
You came and saved me dear
(Saved me dear)
All the sweet things you've been doin'
I ain't never been used to them
Don't ever stop them, dear
(Stop 'em dear)
Oh I'm thankful every day
That you came my way
And I'm gonna make sure that you never ever go away

Cause you, oh, you got what I need, little girl
(Everything I need) Oh yeah
(Medicine to me) Oh baby
Oh you got what i need little girl, oh well, oh
You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it
Baby you
Got it, got it, got it, got it

Oh you, oh you got what I need, little girl
You got everything I need
You're like medicine to me
Oh baby
I got to, I got to, I got to, I got to
Tell you baby
You, you got what I need
You got everything i need
You're like medicine to me, oh baby
You got it, you got it
Oh you got it, got it
Got what I need, little girl
You got everything I need
You're like medicine to meâ€¦
