Oooh, sunshine, blue skies
Please go away
My love has found another
And gone away

With him went my future
My life is filled with gloom
So day after day
I stay locked up in my room

I know to you
It might sound strange
But I wish it would rain
(How I wish that it would rain)
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain

So badly, so badly
I want to go outside
(Such a lovely day)
But I can't stop these tears
From fallin' from my eyes

Listen, I gotta cry
Cause cryin' eases the pain
Oh, yes it does
Oh, yes it does
Oh, yes it does

People, this hurt I feel inside
Words could never explain
I wish it would rain
(Oh, how I wish that it would rain)
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain
(Oh, how I wish that it would rain)
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain
Ohhhh, and rain, rain
Let it rain

Day in, day out
My tear stained face
Pressed against the window pane
My eyes search the skies
Desperately for rain
Cause raindrops will hide my teardrops
And no one will ever know
That I'm cryin', cryin', cryin'
When I go outside

To the world outside
My tears, I refuse to explain
I wish it would rain
(Oh how I wish that it would rain)
Let it rain, let it rain

Ohhhh

I'm a girl and I got my pride
Till it rains, I'm gonna stay inside
Let it rain, let it rain
I wanna say it one more time

I'm a girl and I got my pride
Till it rains, I'm gonna stay inside
Let it rain, let it rain

Ohh ohh ohhh, let it rain, let it rain
