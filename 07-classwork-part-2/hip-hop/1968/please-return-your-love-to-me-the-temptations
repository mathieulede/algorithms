Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
And oh baby

I cry myself to sleep at night
For fear of another holdin you tight and oh baby
Oh baby
I miss you more with each passin day
Every night on my knees I pray oh

Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
Without your love im just no good
I am just a lonely one

Im sorry for the wrong I've done
Now I know how it feels to lose that special someone
And oh baby
I need you more than words can say
Without your love I can pass another day

Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
And oh baby

I want you to know as long as there's
A heaven above
You'll be my one and only love
And oh baby
I can't control this growin' need
Girl come and see about me

Please return your love to me girl
Forgive me for the wrong I've done
And oh baby
