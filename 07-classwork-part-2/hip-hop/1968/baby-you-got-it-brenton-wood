I run after you like a fool would do
But mama didn't raise no fools and I should know
That baby, you got it, heh
That's all I can say

For you got soul, too much soul
Foxy clothes, the cutest nose
A groovy set
There's nothing fake about you
Baby, you got it

People can be cruel, they say I've lost my cool
But it's very hard to keep my cool when I'm around you
'Cause baby you got it
That's all I can say

For you got soul, too much soul
Foxy clothes, the cutest nose
A movie set
There's nothing fake about you
Baby, you got it

Now that I found you , gonna cling to you
I'll give you love and money, everything to you
No matter what they say, no matter what I do
I'm never gonna love another girl but you
'Cause baby you got it, huh
That's all I can say to you

For you got soul, too much soul
Foxy clothes, the cutest nose
A movie set
There's nothing fake about you
Baby, you got it

My friends say, "No can be," you're not the girl for me
But I see a lot of things in you that they can't see
And baby, you got it, heh
That's all I can say to you

For you got soul, too much soul
Baby, you got it
Foxy clothes, the cutest nose
Baby, you got it

The greatest shape, there's nothin' fake
Baby, you got it
The groovy lip, make me flip
Baby, you got it
