So you think
My heart's made of stone
And when you're near me
There's no reaction
Well, you're wrong

From the tip of my toes
My love for you steadily grows
On and on

And each day you're not here
I with my tears
Not on the outside, but
Inside strong
I love you, I love you
I love you, girl
Without you I can't go on

I need you, I need you so badly
To keep this cold heart warm
So when you smile at me
And I don't speak
It's not that I don't care
But that I'm so weak
'Cause from my head to my toes
My love for you steadily grows
Not on the outside
But inside strong

I love you, I love you
I love you, girl
Without you I can't go on
I need you, I need you so badly
To keep this cold heart warm

So you think
My heart's made of stone
And when you're near me
There's no reaction
Well, you're wrong

'Cause from my head to my toes
My love for you steadily grows
Not on the outside
Not on the outside
Not on the outside
Ohhh, but inside strong

I want you, I need you, my baby
Not on the outside
Not on the outside
Not on the outside
Ohhh, but inside strong

I want you, I need you, my baby
Not on the outside
Not on the outside
Not on the outside
Ohhh, but inside strong

I want you, I need you, my baby
Not on the outside
Not on the outside
Not on the outside
Ohhh, but inside strong
