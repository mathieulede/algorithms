Listen, people, listen
I'm gonna sing you a song
About a man who lived good
But didn't live too long

He was born in Macon, Georgia
A poor boy without a dime
He found his way to Memphis
Singing These Arms Of Mine

Otis, Otis Redding was his name
Without his soulful singing
This old world won't be the same

Now he traveled on to Frisco
New York and abroad
Everywhere he sang
The people would applaud

One day he left Georgia
Wisconsin bound
But he didn't get to sing that night
The plane he was in went down

He was a soul music singer
The king of the Memphis sound
It makes me feel so sad
Cause now he ain't around

He died with his guitar
Close to his hands
But his soul lives on today
In the heart of a million fans

Taking about

Otis, Otis Redding was his name
His picture oughta be hung
In the music hall of fame

Otis, he was known as Big O
Otis, we gonna miss him so
Otis, ooh, yeah
We gonna miss him so
