One, two, three, four
There was a time
When I used to dance
There was a time
When I used to prance
Dig me now, baby, ha
Don't worry bout later, ha
Here's a dance I used to do
They call the mash potato, oh
Lookie here
There was a dance
They call the jerk
Everybody relax
And watch me work
All right, lookie here
In my home town
Up here with the boys
The name of the place
Is Chicago, Illinois
Up there, we have a good time
We don't talk, ha
Instead we all get together
Any type of weather
Then we do the camel walk, wow
All right, lookie here
Now there was a dance
That I used to do now
The name of the dance
They call the boogaloo, ha
I may not do the dance
As well as you, ha
But you can bet your bottom dollar
You'll never hear me holler
I'll do the best that I can do, wow
All right, lookie here
There was a time
Sometimes I danced
Sometimes I danced
Baby, sometimes I danced
Baby, baby, baby, yeah

Haven't seen nothing yet
Until you've seen me do
