The guys are gonna wander
Go out and play some times
But girls you must not let it get you down
Just take this advice I give you just like a mother
You try to match your guy just for two
Don't try to do the things that the guys do
Girls you can't do what the guys do, no
And still be a lady
Girls you can't do what the guys do, no
And still be a lady, no

And listen girls when you give your heart away
You can easily be hurt
And the least little wrong he does
Always seems like dirt
So take this advice I give you just like a mother
You try to match your man just for two

Don't try to do the things the guys do
Cause girls you can't do what the guys do, no
And still be a lady
Girls you can't do what the guys do, no
And still be a lady, no

When you put your faith in one guy
Sometimes he'll make you happy
Sometimes he'll make you cry
But don't lose your self-respect
Trying to get revenge
Cause no matter how you do it
You'll lose it in the end
Cause girls you can't do what the guys do, no
And still be a lady
Girls you can't do what the guys do, no
And still be a lady, no
