You're the sweetest thing that I have ever seen
I really love you baby, I'm gonna shake your tree
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time, all right
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind
Every time you kiss me you just thrill me so
I'll never, never, never, ever let you go
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind, all right, yeah
I sigh with the feeling when you're near me
I'm as high as the ceiling, Otis hear me
'Cause I love you baby more and more every day
You're something good to me baby, you're just so sweet to me
Love you baby like I do my ma
I love you, love you baby and your sweet little charms
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time, come on
Lovey dovey, I can't get you out of my mind
Said I sigh with the feeling when you're near me
I'm as high as the ceiling, Otis hear me
'Cause I'm sayin' that I love you honey
Place no one above you, you do something good baby
I'm telling you baby, you're just a
Lovey dovey
Lovey dovey
Lovey dovey
