I saw my love walking down the aisle
And as he passed me by
He turned to me and gave me a smile

Then the preacher, then the preacher
The preacher joined their hands
And all the people, the people began to stand
When I shouted

"You know that it should have been me"
Instead of her walking with you
You know that it should have been me, oh baby
Gettin' ready to marry you, darlin', darlin', darlin'

You made a promise that we would never part
Then you turned around and you broke my little heart
Now you're standing there saying, "I do"
Holding hands with somebody new

You know that it should have been me
Instead of her standing by you
You know that it should have been me
It should have been me
Gettin' ready to say, "I do"

Then the preacher, oh yeah
The preacher asked that there be silence, please
If any objections to this wedding
Speak now or forever or forever hold your peace

Then I shouted, "It should have been me"
You know that it should have been me
You know that it should have been me
Baby, how could you do this to me? Darlin', darlin', darlin'

It should have been me
Don't you know that it should have been me?
You know that it should have been me
It should have been me
I've been faithful to you, baby, baby, baby

It should have been me
How could you do this to me?
You know that it should have been me
