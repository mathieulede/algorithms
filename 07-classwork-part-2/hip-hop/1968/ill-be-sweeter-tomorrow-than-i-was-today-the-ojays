I always like to be
On my P's and Q's
I don't want to miss something
Nice that I can do for you

I know you love me
The way I, oh
But something inside of me
Keeps saying do more
Do more, do more if you can

I got news for you
Good news for, oh
I'm gonna be sweeter to you
Than I was yesterday

You call me you sugar-and-spice man
Your everything-nice man
But I'm just trying to give you
Half as much as you've given me

And I, I don't doubt myself
I know I'm doing my job
But I believe I can squeeze
A little bit more love
Out of this old heart

I know you love me
The way I, oh
But something inside of me
Keeps saying do more
Do more, do more if you can

I got news for you
Good news for, oh
I'm gonna be sweeter to you
Than I was yesterday

I got news for you
Good news for, oh
I'm gonna be sweeter to you
Than I was yesterday
