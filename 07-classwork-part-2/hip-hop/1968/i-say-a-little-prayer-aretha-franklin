[Verse 1]
I say a little prayer for you
The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup
I say a little pray for you
While combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now
I say a little prayer for you

[Chorus]
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

[Verse 2]
I run for the bus, dear
While riding I think of us, dear
I say a little prayer for you
At work I just take time
And all through my coffee break time
I say a little prayer for you

[Chorus]
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

[Bridge]
My darling, believe me (Believe me)
For me there is no one but you
Please love me too
I'm in love with you (Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer, baby (Answer hmy prayer)
Say you love me too (Answer my prayer)
Answer my prayer, baby (Answer my prayer)

[Chorus]
Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
And I will love you
Forever and ever, we never will part
Oh, how I'll love you
Together, forever, that's how it must be
To live without you
Would only mean heartbreak for me

[Bridge]
My darling, believe me (Believe me)
For me there is no one but you
Please love me too
This is my prayer (Answer my prayer)
Answer it right now, baby (Answer my prayer)
Say you love me too (Answer my prayer)
This is my prayer (Answer my prayer)
I'm in love with you (Answer my prayer)
