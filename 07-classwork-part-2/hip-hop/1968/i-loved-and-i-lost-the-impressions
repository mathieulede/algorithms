What do you know about it?
Who had told you so?
It makes no difference
The whole world can know

I loved and I lost
It happens to the best
So I loved and I lost
And I might as well confess

She was so beautiful
Like flowers full bloom in May
Her kiss was like the rolling wind
It left me speechless with nothing to say, no no

I loved and I lost
The fire would not ignite
So I loved and I lost
And I wish her back with all my might
'cause she was so very good to me

I loved and I lost, baby
It happens to the best
So I loved and I lost
And I might as well confess

I loved and I lost, mmm mmm mmm
I loved and I lost, ooh
I loved and I lost
