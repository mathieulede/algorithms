[Chorus]
I'm a girl watcher, I'm a girl watcher
Watchin' girls go by, hey, my my
I'm a girl watcher, I'm a girl watcher
Here comes one now

I was just a boy when I threw away my toys
And found a new pastime to dwell on
Whenever I detects them there of the other sex
I play the game I do so well on

[Chorus]
Mumble something tell my my, but you do look swell
Could you please walk a little slower
Wonder if you know that you're putting on a show
Could you please walk a little closer
