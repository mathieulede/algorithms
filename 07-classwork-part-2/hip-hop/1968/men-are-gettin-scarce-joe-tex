Girls listen, I'm gonna cool you cooks to something
Listen to this
Men are gettin scarce girls
Gettin' scarce as hen's teeth, yeah

Men are gettin' scarce girls
Gettin' scarce as hen's teeth, yeah
There used to be a time
When a woman could get a man with just her charms

Now in order for a woman to get a man
She gotta, she gotta take him
She gotta take him, she gotta take him
She gotta take him right out of another woman's arms

Men are gettin scarce girls
Oh their gettin' scarce girls
Gettin' scarce as hen's teeth,(ha ha)
And that's mighty scarce

Listen to this
I was talkin' to this woman the other day
Now she said, she was gonna quit her man
'Cause he's got a raggedy car

Can you get to that, look here, huh
Women are funny though
Every time her car is runnin' good
They say chile, that's my car (laughter)

Soon as it gets to runnin' bad
She say ah I don't want that old car
That's his car (laughter)
Listen she gonna say to me

She said the other day, she said
It runs hot, it burns oil
This ole car is beat and rundown
The other day the battery fell dead

Right in the heart of town, embarrassin' me
Let me twll you one thing baby
You tell that man to get a tune up on that car
Get a new set of spark plugs, some brand new tires

And a new water pump and you keep that man
'Cause let me tell you one thing right now
Men are gettin scarce girls
Ah their gettin' scarce girls

They're gettin' scarce as hen's teeth,(ha ha)
And that's mighty scarce
Hold it band, hold it, hold it a minute
Say Miss Lady, now you just gonna sit there at that table

And eat all the barbecue and ain't gonna give me none (mumble)
Say what? Oh not you again
Say LeRoy, here's this woman with them skinny legs again
She got a greasy mouth this time

Come over here and get this greasy mouth woman
She reminds me of them folks up in Navisoda, Texas
Eatin' barbecue and drinkin' red soda water on the 19th of June (laughter)
Look here, give me a piece of that barbecue

And kiss me with your greasy mouth (laughter)
I was talkin' to this woman the other day
Now here's a woman that was gonna quit her man
'Cause he wasn't makin' enough money on his job

Talkin' 'bout how much tax Uncle Sam take out of his money
She went on to say something like this
She say they take tax and more tax and they keep on takin' that tax
Why he take so much money from my man

We ain't got enough to relax
Well let me tell you one thing baby
You let that man stay on that ole measely job
And let him keep bringin' home that little $72.50 every week

And you keep that man
'Cause Uncle Sam is gonna get his baby
Don't you worry about that
Men are gettin' scarce baby

They're gettin' scarce as hen's teeth
You got some women their man ain't got no job
Men droppin' off like flies
