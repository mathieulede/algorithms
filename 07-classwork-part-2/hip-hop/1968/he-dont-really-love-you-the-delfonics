He don't really love you, girl
As much as I do, oh
He's only gonna try his best
To make a fool of you because

(He don't really love you)
Like I do
(He don't really love you)
Like I do (like I do) baby
Like I do, yeah

I can remember
How you kiss so fine
Now that you left me
What will I do
What will I do, girl

And I said
(He don't really love you)
And what am I gonna say now
(He don't really love you)

(He don't really love you)
And what am I gonna say now
(He don't really love you)

I said
(He don't really love you)
And what am I gonna say now
(He don't really love you)
Can't you see me crying

(He don't really love you)
Girl, I'm slowly dying
(He don't really love you)
