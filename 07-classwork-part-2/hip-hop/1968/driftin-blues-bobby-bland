Well, I'm drifting and drifting
Like a ship out on the sea
And I've been drifting and drifting, baby
Drifting just like a ship out on the sea

Oh, and you know
I ain't got nobody now, baby
In this great big world
To care for me

If my baby would only
Take me back again
I wish my, my, my, my baby
Would stop fooling around
And take me back again

Well, you know, you know
I messed around out here
Now, baby, yeah, let me tell you
I don't even have no friend

I gave you all of my money, baby
Tell me what more can I do
Lord, after I gave you
All of my money, baby
Pray tell me, what more can I do

Yeah, I know you may be a
Good little girl sometimes now, baby
But I'm standing here to tell you
I know you'll never be true

And that is why
That is why I got to say
Bye bye, baby, yeah

Bye bye, baby
Lord, bye bye bye
Bye bye bye, baby
Baby, bye bye

Oh, Lord, I know
I know it's too late to worry
Lord, too late to cry
Oh, yeah, cry
