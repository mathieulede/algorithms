All we need
But it's so hard to find
Is some peace
Peace of mind

All we need
But it's so hard to find
Is some peace
Peace of mind

When the father
And the mother
Fight all the time
Even the sisters
And the brothers
No time to rhyme

To the left
To the right
So far apart
But with so much
To consider
No time for the heart
Time for the heart

Woah, all we need
Is so hard to find
Is some peace
Peace of mind

Woah, all we need
But it's so hard to find
We need peace
Peace of mind
Peace of mind
Peace of mind
