The Son Of Hickory Holler's Tramp
O see Smith
From the vinyl album "O see Smith's Greatest Hits"
Oh, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger

Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
Yeah, the weeds were high, the corn was dry
When daddy took to drinking
Him and Sally Walker, they up and ran away
Then Momma shed a silent tear

And promised fourteen children
"I swear you'll never see a hungry day"
When Momma sacrificed her pride
The neighbours started talking
But we were much too young
To understand the things they said
All we really cared about
Was Momma's chicken dumplings
And a goodnight kiss
Before we went to bed

Oh, you know, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
When Daddy left and destitution

Came upon our family
Not one neighbour volunteered
To lend a helping hand
So just let 'em gossip all they want
She loved us, and she raised us
The proof is standing here
A full grown man

Last summer Momma passed away
And left the ones who loved her
Each and every one is
More than grateful for their birth
And each Sunday she receives
A big bouquet of fourteen roses
With a card that reads

'The Greatest Mom on Earth'
Oh, you know, the path was deep and wide
From footsteps leading to our cabin
Above the door there burned a scarlet lamp
And late at night a hand would knock
And there would stand a stranger
Yes, I'm the son of Hickory Holler's tramp
