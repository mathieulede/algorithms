Girl I can't believe my ears
Are you really telling me goodbye
See you're taking away
My reason for living
And you won't even tell me why
Before you walk out the door
There's something I want you to know

That I could never ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other love will I share
Cause none can compare
After loving you

It was only yesterday
Your words are still fresh in my mind
Baby you said
Long as the rivers flow
Each day you'd love me more
Now you wanna leave me behind
Listen baby
I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay
I just know I've got to find a way

Cause I could never never never ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoo
No other will I share
Cause none, none can compare
After loving you

So baby please stay beside me
I need your sweet love to guide me
Oh baby baby baby baby baby baby
(I could never love another)
Ooohhhh after loving you
(I could never love another after loving you)

Baby baby baby it was only only only only yesterday
Your words are still fresh in my mind
I remember you said
Long as the rivers flow
Each day you'd love me more
Now you wanna leave, leave me behind listen baby
I don't know what it's gonna take to make you stay
I just know I've got to find a way

I could never, never never never ever love another after loving you
Ooohooo
No other love will I share 'cause none, none can compare after loving you
Ooooooh baby, on my bended knees I'm beggin you to stay here with me

Ooooh

Ooooooh
Baby baby baby baby
I could never never ever never ever love another
After loving you
Ooohoooo
No other love will I share cause none can compare
After loving you
