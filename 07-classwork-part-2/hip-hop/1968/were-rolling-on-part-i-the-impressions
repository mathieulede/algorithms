People get ready
I got good news for you
How I got over
Like we're all supposed to do
Let us all say Amen
And together we'll clap our hands
('Cause we're rolling on)
We're rolling on
(We're rolling on)
We're rolling on

[Chorus]
Lord it's hard to find
And it's hard to climb
But we cannot stop
Until we reach that mountain top
We been tryin', child, so hard
But it takes a little time
Brothers and sisters, don't you worry
You'll get yours and I'll get mine
And we'll all say Amen
And together we'll clap our hands
(We're rolling on)
We're rolling on
(We're rolling on)
We're rolling on

[Repeat Chorus]
Rollin' on, roll on

[Repeat Chorus]
We're rolling on
We're rolling on
Brothers and sisters, child
We're rolling on
Ain't nobody worried
We're rolling on

[Repeat Chorus]
I got give it, got to give it, huh
[FADE]
Keep on pushin'
