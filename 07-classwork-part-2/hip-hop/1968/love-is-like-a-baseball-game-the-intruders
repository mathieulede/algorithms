Love is just like a baseball game
Three strikes you're out

Up to bat (to bat)
I thought I hit a love run
But to my surprise
I found I didn't hit none

Threw her love so fast
She put me in a daze
Never knew that love
Could come so many ways

Strike one, she took me by surprise
Strike two, right in front of my eyes
Strike three, oh, I was out without a doubt
Oh, I was out

Love is just like a baseball game
Three strikes you're out
Whether you win or lose
Love is just like a baseball game
Three strikes you're out
Everybody's got to pay some due

Oh, I'm up to bat
I'm gonna try love one more time
I really love this girl
And I'm gonna make her mine

I ain't never won
When I played a baseball game
Now it seems that love
And baseball are just the same

Strike one, oh, she did it again
Strike two, looks like I'm never gonna win
Strike three, oh, I was out without a doubt
I was out

Love is just like a baseball game
Three strikes you're out
Whether you win or lose
Love is just like a baseball game
Three strikes you're out
Everybody's got to pay some due
You got to pay some due

Love is just like a baseball game
Three strikes you're out
Three strikes you're out whether you win or lose
Love is just like a baseball game
Three strikes you're out
Everybody's got to pay some due
Got to say it again

Love is just like a baseball game
Three strikes you're out
Three strikes you're out whether you win or lose
