It's a beautiful morning, ah
I think I'll go outside for a while
And just smile
Just take in some clean fresh air, boy
No sense in staying inside
If the weather's fine and you've got the time
It's your chance to wake up and plan another brand new day
Either way

It's a beautiful morning, ah
Each bird keeps singing his own song
So long
I've got to be on my way now
No fun just hanging around
I got to cover ground
You couldn't keep me down
It just ain't no good if the sun shines
When you're still inside
Shouldn't hide
Still inside
Shouldn't hide
Still inside, shouldn't hide
Oh, oh, oh

Ooh-ah-ah
Ooh-ah-ah

There will be children with robins and flowers
Sunshine caresses each new waking hour

Seems to me that people keep seeing more and more each day
Gotta say, lead the way
It's okay, brand new day
Gotta say, it's okay
Brand new day, gotta say, lead the way
Oh, oh, oh

Ooh-ah-ah
Oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ah-ah
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ah-ah
Oh
Ooh-ah-ah
Oh, oh, oh
