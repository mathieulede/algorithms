Says it loud and clear
If you're looking for excitement
Baby, you can find it here

It makes you feel good all over

Or whether you're young or old

And let the music thrill your soul

To fill you with delight, shucks
When the music hits your soul

For miles and miles around
Shucks, now get yourself a partner
We gonna tear the whole house down
Now everybody

Show time, baby
Ow, uh
Everybody's having fun, woo
Show time, baby
Ooh, ooh
Everybody, get some

It makes you feel good all over
I'm feeling good all over
