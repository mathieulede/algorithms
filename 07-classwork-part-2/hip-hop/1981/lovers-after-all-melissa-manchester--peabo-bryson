[Melissa Manchester]
When I look deep into your eyes
That's when I know I'm living

[Peabo Bryson]
For every moment of our lives
We should be forgiven, oh

[Melissa Manchester & Peabo Bryson]
We'll hold each other when we cry
Even if we fall
Somehow, we'll be lovers after all

[Peabo Bryson]
In time we'll learn to understand
The meaning of together, my love

[Melissa Manchester]
If we keep walking hand in hand
Then nothing else will matter

[Melissa Manchester & Peabo Bryson]
There will be no need to hide
Feelings that we keep inside
We'll hold each other when we cry
Even if we fall
Somehow, we'll be lovers after all
Oooooh, ooh

We'll hold each other when we cry
Even if we fall
Somehow we'll be lovers after all, ooooh

Lovers, lovers after all
We're still lovers
Lovers, lovers after all
