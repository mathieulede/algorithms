I did my best but I guess my best wasn't good enough
'Cause here we are back where we were before
Seems nothing ever changes we're back to being strangers
Wondering if we oughta stay or head on out the door
Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong
Why we never last for very long what are we doing wrong
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
If we could just get to it I know we could break through it
I gave my all but I think my all may have been too much
'Cause Lord knows we're not getting anywhere
Seems we're always blowing whatever we got going
And seems at times with all we've got we haven't got a prayer
Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong
Why the good times never last for very long
Seems we're always blowing whatever we got going
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
If we could just get to it I know we could break through it
Just once I want to understand why it always come back to goodbye
Why can't we get ourselves in hand and admit to one another
That we're no good with out the other take
The best and make it better find a way to stay together
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right
Make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we can break through it if we could just get to it
Just once if we could get to it
Just once
