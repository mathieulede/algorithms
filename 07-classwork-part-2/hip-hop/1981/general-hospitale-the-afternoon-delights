Rock it hard
Rock it steady
Pick yourself up
And get yourself ready

Wave your arms
Let me hear you yell
We're gonna rap about General Hospital

It started out in Port Charles town
Where Frank Smith's mob used to hang around
No one could prove that he was a crook
Till Luke stole his little black book

It had names and numbers all in code
So Luke and Laura had to hit the road
They had to find the left-handed boy
Watch their step
They had to be coy

The gold involved was worth so much
Others wanted it like Sally and Hutch
But there's one thing I must confess
Sally was a man who wore a dress

Luke kept his cool
He ain't no fool
He set them both up cold
Well Sally died
Hutch survived
And no one got the gold

Paging Dr. Noah Drake
To ICU
To treat a case of heartbreak

They keep me waiting
I don't mind waiting
Don't call me crazy
No, I'm not lazy

My day won't go right
I can't sleep all night
My hands start shaking
My knees start aching
I just can't cope without my soap

General Hospital
General Hospital
Mmm
Number one

General Hospital
You're my worst affliction
General Hospital
You're my favorite addiction

Monica likes to have her fun
That is why she had a son
She told Rick he was the dad
Soon found out that he'd been had

There's one thing
That you can give me that Leslie can't
And that's passion

Alan was the father of course
And he won't give Monica a divorce
Rick wants to get Leslie back
Heather's having an insane attack

I'll get Diana Taylor
She's not crazy
Uh, uh
No never
She just wants to get Dr. Jeff Webber

Jeff wants Annie for his wife
But he might have to wait all of his life
Cause good girls don't
And Annie won't
And you all know what I mean

Amy Vining likes to blab
Richard Simmons helps fight flab
Susan's having Alan's baby
Noah wants Bobbi for his lady

Well, Luke got another job
The Quartermaines are the brand new mob
Laura's the receptionist
What's missing now is the Ice Princess

Yes, Luke Spencer
Please

Diamonds
Not gold are in it this time
Scorpio
The house of Cassadine

On and on
And on it goes
How it ends up
Nobody knows cause

They keep me waiting
I don't mind waiting
Don't call me crazy
No, I'm not lazy

My day won't go right
I can't sleep all night
If I don't find out
It blows my mind out
I just can't cope without my soap

General Hospital

You're my worst affliction

You're my favorite addiction
