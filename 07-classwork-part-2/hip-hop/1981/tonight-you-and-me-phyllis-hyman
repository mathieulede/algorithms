The time is for making
Love's cool and sweet
I said, no, don't you fake it
Love is flowing free
But it's no surprise to me
The touch of your love is everything
Come and supply my needs
Just let me show you the real thing
Baby, tonight--
Oh darlin' you and me
Tonight--
Let it be
The passion is burning
Turning me on, ooh.. ha, ha!
Your love is what I'm asking
You can do no wrong
Ahh.. but it's no surprise to me
The touch of your love is everything
Come and supply my needs
Just let me show you the real thing
Baby, tonight--
Ooh, baby you and me
Ooh, tonight--
Let it be, let it be
Ooh, just you and me
It's no surprise to me
It's no surprising, no, no
It's no surprise to me
Talk about no surprise
It's no surprise to me
I've got your number
It's no surprise to me
Oh, the night time is the right time, yeah
Ooh... hey, hey
It's no surprise to me
You and me, let it be
It's no surprise to me
You and me, let it be
