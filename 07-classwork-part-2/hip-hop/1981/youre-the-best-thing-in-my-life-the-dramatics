You're the best thing in my life
I never felt so good when you added a little rhyme
Lucky for me that you came along
Just whispering a love song then you captured me
And lady it was harmony

Yes, you're music to my heart, a sweet melody
You were heaven right from the start
Don't ever take your love from me

Sweet ecstasy, baby, what you do to me
Your magic I love you much too much to let you go
I need you so, don't ever let your love die
I'm gonna be your man

'Cause you're the best thing in my life, in my life
Best thing in my life, in my life

You're the best thing in my life
Our love was meant to be
'Cause you turn my hopes and dreams into reality

Sweet ecstasy, baby, what you do to me
Your magic and I love you much too much to let you go
You know I need you so, don't ever let your love die
I'm gonna be your man

'Cause you're the best thing in my life, in my life
The best thing in my life, in my life

Woh, oh yeah, your sweet ecstasy, ooh, what you do to me
Woh, oh yeah, oh yeah, when you came along
Just whispering a love song, yes, you captured me
And lady it was harmony, right from the start

The best thing in my life
Was the day, was the day that I met you
The best thing in my life
Was the day, was the day that I met you

The best thing in my life
The best thing, the best thing
Was the day that I met you
Was the day that I met you
Oh yeah
