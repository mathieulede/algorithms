[Verse 1]
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I've looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love and us is very special
Things you seem to do divine
You looked straight into my eyes
I know our love is meant to be
Cause our souls touched tenderly
Love is life and life is living, it's very special

In my heart it was you, only
Love is life, what dreams come true
And even though I can't have you, baby
Desires like these are true for you

[Verse 2]
Hold my hand and take my life
Through these days I venture through
Once my love was truly great
And my life was sewed together
A change in life can bring good things
When you're here with love so supreme
Close to you, our lips should meet
To remember our days so sweet
I need you and you need me, very special
Our love is joyous, yeah, we can make it

In my heart it was you, only
Love is life, what dreams come true
And even though I can't have you, baby
Desires like these are true for you

[Verse 3]
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I've looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love and us is very special
Things you seem to do divine
You looked straight into my eyes
I know our love was meant to be
Cause our souls touched tenderly
Love is life and life is living, very special

[Break]

[Bridge]
Then your love excited me, baby
Days full of joy, love's sweet
Cannot keep this feeling inside, deary
Cause a girl like me has realized that

All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I've looked for you
And today my dreams come true
You need me and I need you
Love and us is very special
Things you seem to do divine
You look straight into my eyes
