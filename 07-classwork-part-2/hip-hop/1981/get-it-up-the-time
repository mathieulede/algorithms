Get it up, get ready for a real good time. I'm gonna try to blow your mind
Can't you see? You and me. It sounds so nasty
Get it up, let your hair hang down. We could fool around
Don't you know? I want you so. Make me happy
Get it up, there's nothin' wrong. We're freakin' all night long
Me and you. We need a groove. It feels good, do it
Get it up, leave your cares behind. Let me try to find
Find the spot. That gets you hot. Let me do ya
What time is it?
Get it up, get ready for a real good time. I'm gonna try to blow your mind
Can't you see? You and me. It sounds so nasty
Get it up, let your body drip. Let me take you on a trip
Can't you see? You're killin' me. You're so freaky
Get it up. Get it up. I'll work you all night
Get it up. Get it up. All night
