It's got to be real
Girl, I could write a book on how you're makin' me feel
I know I'll never find
Another who could match the lovin' you've givin' to me

So this is for the lover in you
This ring means I'll always be true
This is how we'll start love anew
This time it's gonna last forever

I trust you, yes, I do
And girl, you're not the kind a guy could easily charm
'Cause the meaning of love
Is always shown to me when you are wrapped in my arms

So this is for the lover in you
This ring means I'll always be true
This is how we'll start love anew
This time it's gonna last forever (I don't wanna, I don't wanna give you up)

This is for the lover in you (I love you, baby)
This ring (Ooh)
This is (For the lover in you, girl)
This time it's gonna last forever

I could say I never met a girl, no, no
Who satisfied my mental and my physical thing
When I lay me down to sleep
I'm rest assured with the thought that you are right next to me, my baby

This is for the lover in you (Take this ring)
This ring (It means I'll always be true)
This is (How we'll start love anew)
This time it's gonna last forever

This is for the lover in you (Take this ring)
This ring (Oh... Oh...)
This is (Sweet baby)
This time we're gonna be together

Oh...
So much love between us
I'll be the one to come runnin' {Be the one to come runnin'}
Oh, home to you {Home to you}
You give me sweet love
With a woman like you, I don't need to play around
Oh, you're more than just one woman
You're blowin' my mind with the love that you're givin'
That's what you hear me say
Girl, every day

It's for the lover in you, baby
With this ring I'll show you that there ain't no maybes
It's for the lover in you, baby
And it's this time we're gonna last forever

It's for the lover in you, baby
With this ring I'll show you that there ain't no maybes
It's for the lover in you, baby
And it's this time we're gonna be together

It's for the lover in you, baby
With this ring I'll show you that there ain't no maybes
It's for the lover in you, baby
And it's this time
