Came into my life a stranger
You captured my heart
Now I've got to face the danger
I'm ready to start

Thought that I could make it on my own
All alone
I tried to hard to fake it
Now the truth must be known

Two hearts are always better
Together forever
Two hearts are always better
True romance we'll treasure

You've given me so much of yourself
Till I don't need nobody else
And with each passing day
My love for grown strong in ever way
You are my life

Ooh…ooh…ooh…ooh…ooh…ooh…

Never thought that love could touch me
Move me this way
Don't you ever leave me, baby
Promise you'll stay

I'm so glad I got you, girl
Turnin' my world all around
We won't let nobody change
This love that we, we found

Two hearts are always better
Together forever
Two hearts are always better
True romance we'll treasure

You given me so much of yourself
Till I don't need nobody else
And with each passing day
My love for grown stronger ever way
You are my life
