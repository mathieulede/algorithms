Tell me have you always been this shy
I want to know you
I don't really need to pry

Could it be that you're searching for
Love and tenderness
Maybe more
Could it be that I'm what you need
You want love and I'm the missing link

Darling
There's so much that two can do
Baby
I thank my luck stars for you
Darling
There's no doubt, it's you I choose
There's so much that we can do

Hold me
Don't you keep your love inside
I see the magic
Hiding there behind your eyes
Anyone can be alone

Everybody needs to belong
There's so much that two can do
We're in love
And baby, that's the proof
Darling
There's so much that two can do

Baby
I thank my luck stars for you
Darling
There's no doubt
It's you I choose
There's so much that we can do

Baby
It's you and me
Ooh
We're such a hot team
Come closer

Darling
There's so much that two can do
Baby
I thank my luck stars for you
Darling

There's no doubt
It's you I choose
There's so much that we can do
