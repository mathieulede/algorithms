[Verse 1:]
Looks like we're running out of time
Can't hide away
In nights
No longer yours or mine

All things must change
It's so painful
When nothing ever stays the same
But I must go on
While you run away from love, oh

[Chorus:]
Next time you'll know
Not to let my love go
When you feel afraid
And you can't love nobody

Next time you'll know
You must let your heart show
Till the dying day
My friend

[Verse 2:]
Maybe I hurt too easily
But is it wrong to
Feel betrayed when love can't be?

You could change your mind
No excuses could ever
Make me change mine
But I've got to be strong
And believe I'll find the love
Oh

[Repeat Chorus:]

Oh
Believe it

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
