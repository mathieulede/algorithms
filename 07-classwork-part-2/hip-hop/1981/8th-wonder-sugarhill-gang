Ah see I met this girl and I said to her, "Honey

Turned around, didn't mean no harm
I knocked her out, with my vicious charm
I said, "No no baby it's not like that
Ya see I'm all about makin that cold cold cash"
Started jivin around, started messin wit her head
And next thing I know, she wanted to go to *whistle*
But to turn me on, you got to be the best
Cause I'm the Master G, I don't take no mess
Like T-N-T, I'm dynamite
Ya see I rock your body to the early light
And when you wake up in the morning you'll see I'm gone
And check it out girl, you're all alone
Cause you just been hit by the Capricorn King
I rocked you gentle, I rocked you/me

You made me scream but I made you shout *whistle*

[Wonder Mike]
Once upon a time not long ago
Everybody had on their radio
And then the fella came on with a groovy noise
To put the wiggle in the women and girls and boys
The word got around about three cool cats
Who put the ?foot?, BACK, in the pack
And let me tell you party people just who we be
With the help of Big Bank and the Master G
