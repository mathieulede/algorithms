Other guys try to hold her hand
Other guys want a one night stand
They all stare when she's around
I'm so proud how she puts them down
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

I don't worry 'cause we're so tight
See each other 'most every night
She let me have the master key
That's why I kiss her explicitly
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

Some dudes, they think she's teasing
They think she wants to play
But she's so dog-gone pleasing
And hey, that's just her way
And no-one's gonna steal her
She does what she wants to
She only lets me feel her
And then I know it's true

She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

In a day and age when you can't be sure
I've got one with a love that's pure
Guess you'd call her my lucky star
She goes out, but she don't go far
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me

Some dudes, they think she's teasing
They think she wants to play
But she's so dog-gone pleasing
And hey, that's just her way
And no-one's gonna steal her
She does what she wants to
She only lets me feel her
And then I know it's true

She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody, no, no
She don't let nobody
Nobody but me
