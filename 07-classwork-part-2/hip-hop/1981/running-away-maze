If I had my way
I tell you what I'd do
I'd make it all okay
And peace for me and you

I know you've got trouble
But out of that you'll learn
It's the things you want most
Are the things you got to earn, Ha ha ha

Running Away, we need some rejuvenation (Tell the trouth)
Running Away, leaving a bad situation (wohowohowohowo)
Running Away, we need some rejuvenation (Hey)
Running Away, leaving a bad situation (Hey)

If you get confused
Don't you go nowhere else?
You gonna find all you need
Right there in yourself, ha

We all like to bugging
But life is not a game, no
If don't hurry up
None of this would chain

Ooh, We keep
Running Away, we need some rejuvenation
Running Away, leaving a bad situation (That's what I'm goin' to tell you people)
Running Away, we need some rejuvenation (wohowohuwho )
Running Away, leaving a bad situation (Woaah)

Come on y'all
Wouoho Wohuo
Wouoho Wohuo (running away, running away)
What we keep on
Running, Running, Running Away
Running, Running, Running Away
Why do we keep on running
Running, Running, Running Away
Running, Running, Running Away
We can we can we can keep on goin' goin' now!
