Searching to find someone that's strong
Someone that'll really turn me on
And I've been searching like this for quite some time
And up til now no one has blown my mind
Someday the one I'm searching for will come
And that's when all my searching will be done
But until the time that I decide I got someone I can love I'll keep on searching...
Searching to find someone for me:
Someone to fill my life with lots of love and sensitivity
Now I know this can't be hard to find --
But I've been looking and I've got so much time
Someday I know I'll find the one for me
Someone that's not into a fantasy
But until the time that I decide I got someone I can love
I'll keep on searching until I find someone
