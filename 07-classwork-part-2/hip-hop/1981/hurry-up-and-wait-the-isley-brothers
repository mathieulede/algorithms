I don't wanna be no clock watcher
Standin' in line
I don't wanna be someone in love
Wastin' my time
Can I get right to the point, baby
You know I care
Tell me what you want, yeah, baby
And I'm right here
Now tell me what it is I'm supposed to do
And someday I'll get to you
But in the meantime
I know what I gotta do
Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby
On your love
Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby
On your love
I don't wanna be your standby, girl
Hangin' around
I know you would tell me, baby
If I ever let you down
But I cannot second guess you, huh
From what I see
You're not saying nothin', baby
But I know you wanna talk to me, yeah
Now tell me what it is I'm supposed to do
And someday I'll get to you, girl
But in the meantime
I know what I gotta do
Is hurry up and wait, yeah, baby
On your love
Hurry up and wait, yeah, baby
On your love
Well, I don't wanna be that someone
Lettin' you down, yeah
I don't wanna be your standby, girl
Hangin' around, well

And someday I'll get to you, girl
But in the meantime
