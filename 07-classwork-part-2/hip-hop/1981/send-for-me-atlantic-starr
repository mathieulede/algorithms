[Verse 1]
I don't know what was said, my baby
I thought that everything was fine
You say you got to get away to find yourself
Now lady, can't you tell (it's written all over my face)
My days and nights would be a living hell (if you go away)
So think about the misery (that you're gonna put me through)

[Hook]
Goodbye, doesn't mean a thing with you and I, oh no
Our love has stood through all the tests of time, yes it has
If you're planning to leave me behind
Let me put one more thing on your mind

If you ever need me baby (send for me)
I'm just a telephone call away (send for me)
Put a message in a bottle baby, baby, baby (send for me)
Mmm, ooo

[Verse 2]
See you're my everything, sweet baby
My whole world revolves around you
Nothing is what I am without you here in my life

[Hook]
