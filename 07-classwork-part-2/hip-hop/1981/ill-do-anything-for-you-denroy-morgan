Nothing's gonna hurt you
As long as I am here
We're both living for the same dream
And I won't desert you
So come on and dry your tears
You know it's never as bad as it seems

It just kills me
To see that you've been crying
Everybody needs
Someone to help 'em sometimes

I'd do anything for you
I'd change the world
And give it back to you
And everything I got
I'd give it all to you
I'd do anything for you

When nobody sees you
And nobody hears a word
Let me be the one you come to
And all those wishes
That you thought no one heard
I would try to make 'em come true

And it just kills me
To see that you've been crying
Well, everybody needs
Someone to help 'em sometimes

I'd do anything for you
I'd change the world
And give it back to you
And everything I got
I'd give it all to you
I'd do anything for you

Look at me, I'm just like you
And everything you need
Well, I need it too

I'd do anything for you
I'd change the world
And give it back to you
And everything I got
I'd give it all to you
I'd do anything for you

I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you
