Breaking hearts, minds
I do apologize
It's not my way
I hate to make you feel uncomfortable

Take a load off
Or you can put it right on me
It would be my pleasure to unburden you
Actually

I see you, you see me
And I know that you are down
I wanna pick you up from where I see ya
Lying on the ground

Trust in me
I'll take your broken heart home to fix
Cause you're generally on my lips
Whisper my promises

All your strengths and weaknesses too
Baby to me you are a star
So shine on
All your strengths and weaknesses too
Baby to me you are a star
So shine on

Well I know you feel defeat
But if you trust in my heartbeat
Feel the pulse right by your ear
Only for you I will be here

Let me hold you now
The chemistry between us
I feel the power
(Repeat)
