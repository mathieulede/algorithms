[Verse 1: Bill Withers]
I see the crystal raindrops fall
And the beauty of it all
Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind
When I think of you sometime
And I want to spend some time with you

[Refrain: Bill Withers]
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

[Verse 2: Bill Withers]
We look for love no time for tears
Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not for those who wait too late
We gotta go for all we know

[Refrain: Bill Withers]
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
Just the two of us
Building them castles in the sky
Just the two of us
You and I

[Verse 3: Bill Withers]
I hear the crystal raindrops fall
On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And darling when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

[Refrain: Bill Withers]
Just the two of us
We can make it if we try
Just the two of us
(Just the two of us)
Just the two of us
Building big castles way up high
Just the two of us
You and I
