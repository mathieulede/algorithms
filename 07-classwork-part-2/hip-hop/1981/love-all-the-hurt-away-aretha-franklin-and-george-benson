[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
I see myself in your face
A reflection of pain
Somebody made you
Cry over and over again

[Verse 2: George Benson
Still you and I made it
Through all of this for a reason
Yes, we did
Could it be that we created
Affair for all seasons

[Chorus: Aretha & George]
Because you and I
Were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us
There's no other, we're
Finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together, we'll mend
All the cracks in our heart
And love all the hurt away

[Verse 3: George]
Woman, you are the thing that I
Hoped and I prayed for
You give you love and I'm
Happy like never before

[Verse 4: Aretha]
You be the strength and I'll
Be your shoulder to lean on
(You can lean on my shoulder)
We'll build a world and fill our
Whole place with love songs

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro: Aretha & George]
Love all the hurt away
And love all the hurt away
Yes, we're gonna love
We're going to love, baby
We're going to love, love, ohhh
Love all the hurt away
Yeah, yeah
