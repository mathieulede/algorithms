Baby, I, oh, I
I can't live without your love
See, I'm smilin' on the outside, while I'm just cryin' on the inside
Facin' a world without your love

See, the truth has come to light
You're the reason nothing's right
Alone again tonight
All just because of some silly fight

I, oh, oh, oh, I
I don't wanna give without your love, foolishly I suffer
I only pretend, oh, just to fool my friend
Don't know what to do with myself without your love

There's a wounded empty space
Nothing can replace that love
That love, that love, that love that I lost
You're my life, you mean so much to me

And I can't go it alone
This winding, this winding road is so long
So pack it up, baby, get it together
Let's start all over again

I, oh, oh, oh, I
I don't wanna live without your love
While I'm smiling on the outside, I'm just cryin' on the inside
Facin' a world without your love

See, I'm fightin' sleepless nights
Tears have washed all hope from sight
Oh, wouldn't it be, wouldn't it be so right
If I had you right here with me tonight
If you only reach out your hand and save a heartbroken man
I can't live
