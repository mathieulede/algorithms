If you touch me with your smile
I'll get you to paradise
I can make it worth your while
I'll get you to paradise, oh

Houses made of ecstasy
Around the rooms
So picturesque together
(Picturesque together now)
Feeling all our dreams are freed
Romantic thoughts and not
Letting them fade away (oh, no)

Reach for the sky (reach for the sky)
I want you, I want you more
(You know I want you more)
I'll be nearby (I'll be nearby)
Come with me, I'll take you there

Reach for the sky (oh, reach for the sky)
I want you, I want you more
(I want, I want you)
I'll be nearby (You know I'll be nearby)
(You know I'll be nearby)
Come with me, I'll take you there

I'll be back to?
On the road to paradise
You'll be safe with me, so try
We can make a paradise, oh, yeah

I can share my space with you
After all, this is how it should be
I want your love, I need your love
Just some tenders words alone
Let me know that this is
How it ought to be

Reach for the sky (oh, oh)
I want you, I want you more
(I want you, I want you)
I'll be nearby (I'll be nearby)
Come with me, I'll take you there

Reach for the sky (oh, oh)
I want you, I want you more
(I want you more) I'll be nearby
(You know I'll be nearby, oh, oh)
Come with me, I'll take you there

If you touch me with your smile
I'll get you to paradise
I can make it worth your while
I'll get you to paradise, oh

If you touch me with your smile
I'll get you to paradise
I can make it worth your while
I'll get you to paradise, oh

Reach for the sky (reach for the sky)
I want you, I want you more
(You know I want you)
I'll be nearby (I'll be nearby)
Come with me, I'll take you there

Reach for the sky
(Reach for, reach for the sky)
I want you, I want you more
(You know I want you, you know I want you)
I'll be nearby (I'll be nearby)
Come with me, I'll take you there

Reach for the sky (reach for the sky)
I want you, I want you more
(I want you, I want you more)
I'll be nearby
Come with me, I'll take you there
