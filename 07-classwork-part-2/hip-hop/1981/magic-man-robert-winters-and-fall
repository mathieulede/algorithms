Oh Robert, sing to me baby

I can pull a rabbit out of a hat
Disappear and return like that
Cause baby, I'm your Magic Man, yes I am

Tricks with cards are easy to do
And tricks with hearts will cast a spell on you
Cause baby, I'm your Magic Man, yes I am

I'm your, Magic Man
Won't you, let my magic hands
Touch your heart and make your love appear

I will stop your frowns
And turn them upside down
Cause I'll be around, to hold ya near

If your heart is broken, bring it to me
With a wave, I'll mend it, oool you'll see baby
That I'm your Magic Man, yeah

On stage and lights, I'll dazzle your eyes
And later on that night, I'll make you realize
Baby, I'm your Magic Man, yeah

I'm your Magic Man
Won't you let my magic hands just
Touch your heart and make your love appear

I will stop your frowns
And turn them upside down
Cause I'll be around, to hooooooooold you, to hooooooooold you, you near

I'm your Magic Man
Won't you let my magic hands
Just touch your heart and make your love appear

I will stop all your frowns
And turn them upside down
Cause I'll be around to hold ya, near

I'm your Magic Man
Won't you let my magic hands
Just touch your heart and make your love appear
I will stop all your frowns
And a turn them upside down
Cause I'll be around, to hold ya, near yeah

I'm your Magic Man, yeah
Won't you let my magic hands
Touch your heart and make your love appear, yeah

And I will stop all of your frowns
Turn them upside down
Cause I'll be around to hold you, near
