I've got a heart full of love
But nobody to call my own
(To call me own)
If I could call you my woman
I promise you I'll never leave you alone
Hear me, baby

You speak the words so sweet
It means so much to me
That you know how to treat a woman
But the man for me must love me totally
And understand I'm a woman
Can you give me that kind of love?

I heard you callin'
Well baby, baby, here I am
Tellin' you my heart is in your hands
In love I'm fallin'
So baby, baby, here I am

And I'll make that lasting impression on love, girl
(Girl)
That you won't forget
(That you won't forget)
Girl, I'm no stranger to pain
I've had my ups and downs
But I don't regret what I've learned

Baby, just like you, I've been through it too
But it's worth it when I see you
Right in front of me
(Right in front of me)

With you I want to be
(With you want to be)
Now you've got somebody to love
So baby, here I am

Here I am
Here I am
Here I am

Come get it, baby, here I am
Here I am
Let me be your lover, be your man
I'm ready, baby, here I am
Here I am

I heard you callin'
Well baby, baby I, here I am
I just have to make you understand
In love I'm fallin
So baby, baby, here I am

As long as I live, I will be right there
With a love that's strong
(With a love that's strong)
And I don't care about the past, 'bout the past
It's gonna be up to me
To change right from wrong for the both of us

Baby, just like you I want the same thing too
And I'll give my all and all
To make sure, my love
(Make sure, my love)

That you don't get enough
(You don't get enough)
I'll be coming at you forever, baby, here I am

You know I need it
Well, baby, baby, here I am
Let me be your lover, be your man
I really mean it
So baby, baby, here I am

Here I am
Come get it, baby, here I am
Keep you by my side, I know I can
I'm ready, baby, here I am
Here I am
