Maurice white, david foster & brenda russel

She was naive, and never knew
Back against the world--her dreams came true
There is a mirror in her eyes
All the world with cherry painted skies
I would be a fool, not to notice who
Can make me want to give it all
Oh, and now, i'm a happy soul
That love has got a hold
And i know that love won't let me fall

You--light the way, you brighten up my day
You make me want to stay
I guess you know that i'm in love with you
It's true, you changed my point of view
And now i look at life, the way you do
With a beauty shining thru

When i am true with my dreams
Life is so sincere, in what it means
I am truly hypnotized--with a love
That took me by surprise
I would be a fool, not to notice who
Can make me want to give it all
Oh and now, love is so profound
I need your love around to open yp
This lonely heart

You--light the way, you brighten up my day
You make me want to stay
I guess you know that i'm in love with you
It's true, you changed my point of view
And now i look at life, the way you do
With a beauty shining thru

You-light the way, you brighten up my day
You make me want to stay
I guess you know that i'm in love with you
It's true, you changed my point of view
You make it all seem right
I'd love to share my life, with you
