You are to me as sweet as apple pie
You're next to me, we'll reach the highest high
Oh, can't you see it could be ecstasy
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I

Turn down the light, we'll turn 'em way down low
No need to fight, we'll take it nice and slow
Baby, tonight, we gotta let go
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know

Stay the night
You're a woman, I'm a man
Stay the night
We can do what things you planned

Stay the night
Stay the night
Stay the night

We're all alone, there's only you and I
Pull out the phone, we'll kiss the world goodbye
We'll stay at home and make it on our own
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I

Turn down the light, we'll turn 'em way down low
No need to fight, we'll take it nice and slow
Baby, tonight, oh, we gotta let go
Do you know, do you know, do you know, do you know

Stay the night
You're a woman, I'm a man
Stay the night
We can do what things you planned

Stay the night
Stay the night
Stay the night

Stay
Stay the night
Stay
Stay the night

Stay
Stay the night
Stay
Stay the night (Stay the night, stay the night)

Stay the night
You're a woman, I'm a man
Stay the night
We can do what things you planned

Stay the night
Stay the night
Stay the night

Stay
Stay the night (Stay the night)
Stay
Stay the night (Stay the night)

Stay (You're a woman, I'm a man)
Stay the night
Stay (We can do what things you planned)
