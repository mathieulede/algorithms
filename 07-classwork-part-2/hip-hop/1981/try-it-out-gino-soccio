You know it’s all in your mind
So get on up and take a stand
Try it out
There ain’t nothing you can lose
So don’t hesitate no more
Try it out
If you feel that it's alright
Something inside you leads the way
Try it out
Don’t pay no mind
To what they say
You’ll never know until you do
Try it out

Is what they say
That’s the game you have to play
Try it out
Take the time, take a chance
Every minute, every day
Try it out
So come on, come on
