We're all American girls
And we love the life that we lead
We're all American girls
Hear what we say
Know what we mean
We're all American girls

The day has finally come
We're reaching out for number one
We've worked hard all of our lives
It was a fight just to survive
You`d better get this straight

Wise up
Before it's too late
We`re not threatened by your lies
Or your goodbyes

We're all American girls
Sometimes the struggle gets rough
You give your all
But it`s not enough
A vacant job at the top

Don't let them tell you
That right you`re not
We`re not asking to reverse roles
So long rehearsed

Give us an equal share
That's just fair
We're all American girls
