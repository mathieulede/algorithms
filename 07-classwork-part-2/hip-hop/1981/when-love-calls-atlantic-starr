[Verse 1]
Here I stand with open arms, I’m offerin’ my love to you
I wanna do for you all the things that you want me to
There’s so much more that I could do for you
But you just won’t let me give you my love, boy, what is wrong with you?

[Hook]
Don’t you know when love calls
You’d better answer (You’d better answer)
‘Cause it might be a big mistake
If you decide to hesitate

When love calls, yeah
You’d better answer (You’d better answer)
Don’t let it slip away too many times
‘Cause love may not ever come again

[Verse 2]
I know that your heart is into playin’ the field and that blinds you
Baby, you can’t see the forest for the trees, no no
The candle in my heart burns slowly every day
Don’t you mess around too long and let it melt away

[Hook]

[Bridge]
True love is so hard to come by, it’s precious and it’s rare, yeah
But I’ve got a lot of it to give, don’t miss out, don’t you dare
Just this time, come on and see it through
I’m willing and waiting, but it’s all up to you

[Hook/Outro]
When love calls, yeah
You’d better answer (You’d better answer)
Don’t let it slip away too many times
‘Cause love may not ever come again

You’d better listen, yeah
(You’d better listen when love calls, baby)
(You’d better listen when love calls your name)
I’m callin’ your name
(You’d better listen when love calls, baby)
(You’d better listen when love calls your name)
(You’d better listen when love calls, baby)
(You’d better listen when love calls your name)
(You’d better listen when love calls, baby)
(You’d better listen when love calls your name)

When love calls
You’d better answer me, baby
