Hee!
(You are under my power. It is the power of love.)

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

You say my kisses taste like magic; (Well, stop!)
That's got to be the classic line...
Please no more presto change-o now that I'm in love, baby
'Cause that would really blow my mind...

I'd pull a rabbit out of my hat or cross a black cat's path to find you
And darling, you can best believe there's nothing up my sleeve but love...
(It must be magic, must be magic, must be magic!)

It must be magic... (It must be magic...)
It must be magic... (It must be magic...) Got me under your spell, baby...
It must be magic... (It must be magic...)
Oh, baby, it must be magic... (It must be magic...)

Ooh, you got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine;
Keep workin' my love, such a magical feeling...
You got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
And I love it, love it, love it...

(Tilt me.)
It must be magic, baby! 'Cause it feels so good!
It must be magic, baby! 'Cause it feels so good!

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)
It must be magic, baby! 'Cause it feels so good!
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)
It must be magic, baby! 'Cause it feels so good!

You say, you know I got the potion; (Well, stop!)
No, baby, don't stop, don't you dare... (Don't you stop it, baby, don't you dare...)
Aladdin, Houdini and Merlin, the magician
To you, they never could compare...

I see no long black flowing cape, yet still, I can't escape those two eyes
(When I look in your eyes...)
And we don't need no crystal ball, 'cause we have said it all in love...
(It must be magic, must be magic, must be magic!)

It must be magic... (It must be magic...)
It must be magic... (It must be magic...) Got me under your spell, baby...
It must be magic... (It must be magic...)
Oh, baby, it must be magic... (It must be magic...)

Ooh, you got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine;
Keep workin' my love, such a magical feeling...
You got me tiltin' just like a pinball machine
And I love it, love it, love it...
I can't get enough of it, of it, no, no, no, whoa!

It must be magic... (It must be magic...)
It must be magic... (It must be magic...) Got me under your spell, baby...
It must be magic... (It must be magic...)
Oh, baby, it must be magic... (It must be magic...) Our good fortune, I can tell, baby...

It must be magic, 'cause it feels so good to me;
It must be magic, got me love, got me lovin' you...
It must be magic, 'cause it feels so good to me;
It must be magic, got me love, got me lovin' you...

Teena went to wonderland, the plot is getting thick! (Ooh, magic...)
Met the king of Punk Funk and he taught her all the tricks!
She feels the heat, there's magic in her feet;
Now she's groovin', always movin' to the funky beat!

Under your spell - ooh, it must be magic;
Under your spell - What is it? What is it?
Under your spell - ooh, it must be magic;
What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it?

It must be magic, 'cause it feels so good to me;
It must be magic - Got me under your spell, baby...
It must be magic, 'cause it feels so good to me;
It must be magic - Our good fortune I can tell, baby...

It must be magic - We're gonna take it to the top!
It must be magic - Don't you let the magic stop!
It must be magic - Got me love, got me lovin' you...
(Got me love, got me lovin' you...) Got me love, got me lovin' you...

It must be magic, 'cause it feels so good to me;
It must be magic - Got me under your spell, baby...
It must be magic, 'cause it feels so good to me;
It must be magic - Temptations, sing!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... (It must be magic!)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh... (It must be magic!)

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)
Baby must be a magician, 'cause he's sure got the magic touch...
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...) It must be magic!
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...)
My baby must be a magician, 'cause he's sure got the magic touch...
