I had you on my mind
Way we met it all happened so fast
It was love in your eyes
When we touched there was love, so let's make it last

If love is real
The way I feel, yeah
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love

I woke up late last night
Visions of you real they seem
Needed you by my side
Now with you in my life I can live in this dream

If love is real
The way I feel
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
I'm in love, yeah... hey... yeah...
I'm in love, love, love, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
There just ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
I'm in love, ah
I'm in love, ooh

Ooh
And there ain't no doubt about it, I'm in love
Way I feel about you, there ain't no doubt about it
No, no, I'm in love
