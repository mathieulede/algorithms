Ooh, this kind of lovin'
I only get from you
This kind of lovin'
I only get from you, from you

Nothing ever felt like this
So much fire in your kiss, gettin' kinda serious
Makes me wanna play it fair
Can't no other compare, so far I can't get enough

You got to be one of a kind
Girl, I can't get you out of my mind
And I tell you, baby, I've been around
But there's only one thing that I found

This kind of lovin'
I only get from you, yeah
This kind of lovin'
I only get from you, from you

'Cause those things were meant to be
Talkin' 'bout you and me, I don't want nobody else
And I'll never go nowhere
Baby, this I won't share, you got me all to yourself

'Cause there's always something new
In the way you do the things you do
And there's no other in this world, no
That I would ever call my girl

This kind of lovin'
I only get from you
This kind of lovin'
I only get from you, from you
Only you, only you

I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere

You are the meaning of the word 'Satisfaction'
Whenever we're alone, it's such a good reaction
Nobody ever made me feel this way
So I'm stayin' here with you, my dear, each and every day

'Cause those things were meant to be
Talkin' 'bout you and me, I don't want nobody else
And I'll never go nowhere
Baby, this love I won't share, you got me all to yourself

'Cause there's always something new
In the way you do the things you do
And there's no other in this world, no
That I would ever call my girl

This kind of lovin'
I only get from you, baby
This kind of lovin'
I only get form you, from you

I ain't goin' nowhere
