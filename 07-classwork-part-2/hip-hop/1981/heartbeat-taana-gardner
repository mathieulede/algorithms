Heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak
Heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak
Heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak
Heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak

There’s nothin’ I won’t do
Anything you want me to
Can’t keep my hands off you
When you hold me in your arms
You shook up by me with your charms
And I just don’t give a darn, my heartbeat

I don’t see you every day
But in my own little way
Ooh… I love you

Ho… it really makes me wanna freak
(My heart beats for the one I love) ‘Cause you’re so sweet, sweet enough to eat
(My heart beats for the one I love) Oh, love is complete
(My heart beats for the one I love) Oh, the one I love, yeah, yeah, yeah
(My heart beats for the one I love) Ooh, you’re sweet to me

Heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak
Heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak

When you hear my little fears
Why my sad and lonely tears

Haven’t felt so good in years
My heartbeat

Those dark and lonely nights
I wish with all my might
Ooh, to have you

Now I’m here all alone
I wait here by the phone
To have you

Ho… it really makes me wanna freak, oh
(My heart beats for the one I love) You’re so sweet, sweet enough to eat
(My heart beats for the one I love) My heartbeat
(My heart beats for the one I love) My love’s complete
(My heart beats for the one I love) Oh, ‘cause I’m the one I love

(My heart beats for the one I love) My heartbeat
(My heart beats for the one I love) Sweet, makes me weak, yeah
(My heart beats for the one I love) Sweet, my sweetness makes me freaky
(My heart beats for the one I love) My heart beats for the one I love

Heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak
Heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak

Oh… it really makes me wanna freak
(My heart beats for the one I love) ‘Cause you’re so sweet, sweet enough to eat
(My heart beats for the one I love) My heartbeat, oh
(My heart beats for the one I love) My love is complete
(My heart beats for the one I love) Oh, just for the one I love

(My heart beats for the one I love) My heartbeat
(My heart beats for the one I love) Sweet, makes me weak, yeah, yeah
(My heart beats for the one I love) Sweet, your sweetness makes me freaky
(My heart beats for the one I love) My heart beats for the one I love

Now you know this just don’t make no kind of sense
Walkin’ ‘round here so intense
You make my heartbeat
You make me feel so weak
Movin’ all around
From my head to the ground
You make my heartbeat
You make me feel so weak
‘Cause everything you said
Went right straight to my head

Movin’ all around
From my head to the ground
Everything you said
Went right straight to my head

Oh, you make me feel so weak, yeah

Lying here alone
I wait here by the phone
Oh, don’t make no kind of sense
Feelin’ this intense
Oh, my heartbeat

Oh, sweet, make me weak, yeah, yeah

Heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak
Heartbeat
It makes me feel so weak

It makes me feel so weak
