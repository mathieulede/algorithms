Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you pass them by
(Pass them by)
Now you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try
(Let me try)

Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing
All I know is

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means I love you
(Baby, baby, baby)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means I love you

If there ever was a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me
(One for me)
Let me hold you in my arms
Girl, and fill me with your charms
I'm sure that you will see
(You will see)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Come on and listen, girl

Didn't I blow your mind this time?
Didn't I
Didn't I blow your mind this time?
Didn't I
(Whoa, baby)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means I love you
(Come on, girl
Come on with me, baby)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means I love you
(Think about you night and day)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la means I love you

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
