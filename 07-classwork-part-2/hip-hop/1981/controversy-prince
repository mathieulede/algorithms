[Verse 1]
I just can't believe all the things people say (controversy)
Am I black or white? am I straight or gay? (controversy)
Do I believe in god? do I believe in me? (controversy)
Controversy (controversy)
I can't understand human curiosity (controversy)
Was it good for you? Was I what you wanted me to be? (controversy)
Do you get high? does your daddy cry? (controversy)
Controversy (controversy)

[Chorus]
Do I believe in god? do I believe in me?
Some people wanna die so they can be free
(I said) life is just a game, were all just the same...(do you wanna play?)
Controversy, controversy, controversy
Controversy, controversy, controversy

[Bridge]
Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever

[Refrain]
Controversy, controversy, controversy
Love him, love him baby
Controversy, controversy, controversy
Controversy, controversy, controversy

[Verse 2]
Listen
People call me rude, I wish we were all nude
I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules
People call me rude, I wish we were all nude
I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules
People call me rude, I wish we were all nude
I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules (Yeah!)
Controversy (Oh Yeah...)
Controversy

[Chorus]
Do I believe in god? do I believe in me? let me tell ya...
Some people wanna die so they can be free
