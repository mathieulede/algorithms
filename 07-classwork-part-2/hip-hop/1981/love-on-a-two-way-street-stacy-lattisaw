I found love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway

True love will never die
So I've been told
But now I must cry
It's finally goodbye, I know

With music softly playing
His lips were gently saying
I love you
He held me in desperation
I thought it was a revelation
And then he walked out

How could I be so blind
To give up love for the very first time
To be fooled is a hurting pain
To be loved and fooled is a crying shame
While I bear the blame as he laughs my name

With music softly playing
His lips were gently saying
Honey, I love you
He held me in desperation
I thought it was a revelation
And then he walked out

I found love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway

I found love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway
Love on a two way street
And lost it on a lonely highway
