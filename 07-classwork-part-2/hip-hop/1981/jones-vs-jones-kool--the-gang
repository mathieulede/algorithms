We don't feel like talking
There's nothing to be said
I guess it's just confusion
Rolling 'round our heads
Still, we know there's love here
We just can't work it out
The hardest part of all, babe
Is breaking up and out

So here's where we let go
So here's where we step out
The hardest part of all, babe
Is breaking up and out

We had a love so strong
Tell me, where did we go wrong?

'Cause I received a notice
They called me on the phone
To come and sign the papers
Of Jones vs. Jones
Gone are the days of me and you

(I just can't believe it baby
All this love is now so crazy)
(Jones vs. Jones)
Me and...

You believed in me once
Girl, I believed in you
Man and woman
Love's so beautiful
Still we know there's love here
We just can't work it out
When the hardest part of all, babe
Is breaking up and out

So here's where we let go
So here's where we step out
September never seemed so cold
Where in the world did love go?

(I just can't believe it baby
All this love is now so crazy)
(Jones vs. Jones)

I received a notice
They called me on the phone
To come and sign the papers
Jones vs. Jones
Gone are the days of me and you
(I just can't believe it baby)
You
(All this love is now so crazy)
(Jones vs. Jones)
Mr. and Mrs. Jones

So here's where we let go
So here's where we step out
The hardest part of all, babe
Is breaking up, breaking up and out

(I just can't believe it baby)
Who's to blame, for a name that's changing?
(I just can't believe it baby)
Goodbye, baby
(Jones vs. Jones)
(I just can't believe it baby)
It's all over but the memories
(I just can't believe it baby)
I can't believe it
(Jones vs. Jones)
(I just can't believe it baby)
Goodbye, baby...
