Sometimes in this world
You find it so hard to carry on
If you stop and think about it
You will see what's going on

If happiness is your desire
Inside of yourself you hold the key
Just have faith in what you're doing
Be yourself, and you'll be free

You are you, and I am me
That's the way it was meant to be
Be yourself in everything you do
Don't give up, 'cause [?] it's all up to you

Open up your eyes, open up your heart
And feel this world love

[Chorus]
Be yourself
(You just got to be)
No one else
(No one else)
Be yourself
(I don't care what the people say
You got to be yourself
Be yourself today)

Be yourself
No one else
(I wanna see)
Be yourself
(I said be yourself)

[Break]

[Chorus]
Be yourself
No one else
(I want you to be)

Be yourself
No one else

You are you, and I am me
That's the way it was meant to be
Be yourself in everything you do
Don't give up, 'cause it's all [?] up to you

Open up your eyes, open up your heart
And feel this world love

[Chorus]
Be yourself
(You just got to be)
No one else
(No one else)
Be yourself
(I don't care
No I don't care
I said I don't care...)

(Fade)
