Wheels turning for the yearning, the burning that I feel inside
It's turning me around upside down, can't control it though I try

Just one moment away is too far away from lovin' you girl, uh baby
Just one moment away is too far away from lovin' you girl, hey

Imagination, concentration pure delight all through the night
A world of ecstacy has taken over me, just don't hurry mornin' light, hey

Can't you feel it? Can't you feel it? Uh I love it, uh I love it
I just want you with me

Just one moment away is too far away from lovin' you girl uh baby
Just one moment away is too far away from lovin' you girl yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just one moment away is too far away from lovin' you girl

Can't you see I need you girl
Can't you see, can't you see

Just one moment away too far away from lovin' you girl, uh baby
Just one moment away is too far away from kissin' you girl, uh sugar
Just one moment away is too far away from squeezin' you baby

Repeat
