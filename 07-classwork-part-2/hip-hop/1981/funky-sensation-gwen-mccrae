Can you feel it?
My funky sensation
I"m calling all you party people
Come on get up and dig that funk that I have for you
I have a feeling sensation
That was spread around the nation
Get up clap your hands and feel the groove
You see people like me
Need people like you
To come together and enjoy the funky beat
Take your time relax your mind
Come on, come on and dig my funky sensation
Take your time relax your mind baby
Ain"t it good, ain"t it funky now
This funk is like an extra strength
Pain reliever, I make you feel better
Than you ever did before
It is a pit indication
It is a funk revelation
Come on, come on and joy my funky sensation
It's just a matter of time
That you'll love relax your mind
Come on shake it shake it don't break it
I"m calling all you party people
Come on and feel this my funky sensation

You ain"t never had no funk like this before
Look at that man over there in the corner honey
He ain"t never moved like he"s moving now
It"s just the funky sensation
Feel that funky sensation
