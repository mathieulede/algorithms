Falling in love, it was easy at the start
I thought I had it in my hands
Something went wrong, somewhere we lost a part
It was more than we could stand, yeah

It was too late when I realized
That I couldn't see the forest or the trees
What was wrong with me?
There comes a time in every life
Love will come your way
And if it should stay you'd better hold on to it tight

And never let it go not love
It's a shining star that's here to guide you
Every lover knows
You've got to hold on to the good inside you
Let the feeling flow
And I'm sure love will grow
