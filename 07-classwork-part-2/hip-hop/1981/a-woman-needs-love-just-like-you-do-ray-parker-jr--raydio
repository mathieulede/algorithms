Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Mmm-mmm-mmm
A woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Don’t kid yourself into thinkin?that she don’t
She can fool around just like you do, hoo
Unless you give her all the lovin?she wants
Don’t the mistake of thinkin?old fashioned [Ooh, ooh]
Times have changed from yesterday
But no longer will those old double standards [Ooh, ooh]
Be accepted by the women of today
So when you think you’re foolin?her
She just might be foolin?you
Remember if you can do it
She can too
Because a woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don’t kid yourself into thinking that she don’t
She can fool around just like you do, hoo
Unless you give her all the lovin?she wants
When her eyes are beggin?for affection [Ooh, ooh]
Don’t put her off, don’t make her wait
Don’t try to give her that worn out excuse [Ooh, ooh]
About being tired and workin?late
I tell you one day you’ll come home
Early from work [Home from work]
Open up the door
And get your feelings hurt
Because she needs it, yeah [Just like you do, hoo]
A woman’s got to have it, whoa, yeah, just like you
And if you’re smart, mmm, [Just like you do, hoo] you better stop foolin?her the love, mmm
[Just like you do, hoo], yeah
That sweet, sweet love, she wants it just like you
‘Cause she can fool around [Just like you do, hoo] just like she will fool
Around
With you or without you, just like you do
A woman needs love just like you do, hoo
Hey, don’t kid yourself into thinking that she don’t, hoo, ooh
She can fool around just like you, hoo
A woman needs it just like you
