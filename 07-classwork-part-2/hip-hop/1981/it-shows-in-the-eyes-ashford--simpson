Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Oh, oh...oh...oh...
Ooh, ooh
No, you don't think nobody sees ya
Act as if it's all so far beneath ya
Say you don't care
Well, i declare, some people
Talk and sass around like it don't matter
You're the only one who's all together
Say it's never love that you're thinkin' of
But it shows in the eyes
It shows in the eyes (just a hint of tears you cry)
It shows in the eyes (don't you know)
It shows in the eyes
That's the mirror to your soul
And it's something you can't disguise
Try to wear a face without no passion
Masquerade around like love's old fashioned
Just because it's not something you got
Don't knock it
Try to second guess what people see
All the time it's just your vanity
No one's impressed and you wonder why
Well, it shows in the eyes {oh, babe}
It shows in the eyes (no, no)
That's the mirror to your soul
And it's something you can't disguise {oh, baby}
It shows in the eyes (ooh...) {don't you know}
It shows in the eyes
That's the mirror to your soul
And it's something you can't disguise
What you hidin' for
Behind the door
Come on out
Don't be scared no more
Somebody's lookin'
Somebody sees
And you can't push it
Up your sleeve
It shows in the eyes (ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah) {don't you know}
It shows in the eyes (ooh)
What you hidin' for
Behind the door
Come on out
Don't be scared no more
Somebody's lookin'
Somebody sees
And you can't push it
Up your sleeve
It shows in the eyes
It shows in the eyes
That's the mirror to your soul
And it's something you can't disguise
It shows in the eyes {don't you know}
It shows in the eyes (yes, it does)
That's the mirror to your soul
And it's something you can't disguise
It shows in the eyes {don't you know}
It shows in the eyes
That's the mirror to your soul
And it's something you can't disguise {you can't disguise, baby}
It shows in the eyes {don't you know}
It shows in the eyes {ah, yeah}
That's the mirror to your soul
And it's something you can't disguise
