When I came home last night
You wouldn't make love to me
You went fast asleep
You wouldn't even talk to me
You say I'm so crazy
Coming home intoxicated
I said I just wanna love ya
(I just wanna love you baby)
Guess that's why I'm so elated (C'mon girl)

Give it to me baby (give to me baby)
Give it to me baby (give to me baby)
(I betcha) I'll make you hot like you had enough
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Just give it to me baby
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
(I betcha) I'll make you hot like you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff
That funk
That sweet
That funky stuff (Say what)
(Give it to me)
Give me that stuff
That funk
That sweet
That funky stuff (Say what)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me that stuff
That sweet, funky stuff

YOooooh HOoo aww

(Give to me baby)

When I was high as the sky
Out all night just dancing
You say let's go home (c'mon Rick, I'm tired. Let's go home)
That's the time I start romancin'
You say "how can I love ya?"
(how can I love you baby)
"When your body keeps on moving"
I say "Wait til I squeeze you" (oh)
Maybe then you'll start to groovin'
(c'mon girl)

Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
(I betcha) I'll make ya hot like you had enough
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
(Just give it to me baby)
Give it to me baby (give it to me baby)
(I betcha) I'll make ya hot like you had enough

Give it to me
Give me that stuff
That funk
That sweet
That funky stuff (Say what)
(Give it to me)
Give me that stuff
That funk
That sweet
That funky stuff (Say what)
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me
Give me the stuff
That sweet, funky stuff
