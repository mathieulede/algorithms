Baby
Ooo baby
Baby, baby (baby)
Ooo um baby
Oh baby

[1st Verse]
We need to um talk about where
We're taking this thing
How far we're gonna let this go
We've been here before
It's getting late

[Chorus]
It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
I'm afraid, (Don't Be)
I'm afraid, (Don't Be)
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me, twice
Baby, oh baby baby baby

[2nd Verse]
Listen, I've already been thinking about you on my mind
Far too often for you
To be here at this time
You see, one hands on mine and the others on my thigh
Look, I already played with the idea of you
Being here in the morning
And the position for the crack of dawn
And the conversation before the yawning
But aah, it's getting late, it's getting late

[Chorus]
It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me twice
Oh baby baby baby

[2nd Verse]
How's about I let you touch the space
That you left behind
The day that you stop smiling
The day that the tears started falling
But now were talking, touching
Almost making sensual again
We can taste the familiar
Cause, the family hour supports it
Of this moment, but was led by the movements cause ah
It's getting late

[Chorus)
It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
But I'm afraid, (you say) don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me twice
Oh baby baby baby
Oh baby twice baby baby
Oh baby baby baby baby baby baby
Baby baby baby baby baby
Oh baby baby baby baby baby
Oooh baby

[3nd Verse]
I see the memories we replayed
Same space face bodies
I know there's a method to your manliness
But ah I'm a afraid

[Chorus]
It's getting late. (It's getting late)
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, you say don't be
But I'm afraid, and you say don't be
I'm afraid that you'll gonna hurt me baby, baby twice baby
Good baby baby baby
[?] baby baby baby
Ooooh baby

[Break Down]
I see the memories replayed, same space, same face
Same bodies baby
I know this method to your manliness
But I'm afraid, babe
I see the memories replayed, same space, same face
Same bodies baby I know this method to your manliness
But I'm afraid, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oh [?] baby, baby, baby
[?]
Please don't hurt me baby
I'm afraid, baby
Please don't hurt me baby
I'm afraid, baby
Please don't hurt me baby
Please don't hurt me
I'm afraid, babe
Please don't hurt me baby
I'm afraid, babe
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
