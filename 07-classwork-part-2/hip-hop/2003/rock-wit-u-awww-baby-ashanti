[Intro: Ashanti & Irv Gotti]
Aw baby
Yeah, Murder Inc
I wanna love you, babe
I'm thinking of you, babe
Ooh baby
Ashanti, chapter two
Let's rock

[Chorus]
Can you rock with me? (Aw baby)
Nonstop with me, can you take it to the top with me?
I just wanna love you, baby (I wanna love you, babe)
Always thinking of you, babe (I'm thinking of you, babe)
Can you roll with me? (Ooh baby)
All over me, can you take control of me?
I just wanna love you, baby
Always thinking of you, baby

[Verse 1]
I think I like how your body feels next to me
Aw baby, when you're kissing me
Aw baby, when you're loving me
I can't describe what I want to do to you tonight
Aw baby, when you come to me
I'll make it so you'll never leave

[Chorus]
Can you rock with me? (Aw baby)
Nonstop with me, can you take it to the top with me?
I just wanna love you, baby (I wanna love you, babe)
Always thinking of you, babe (I'm thinking of you, babe)
Can you roll with me? (Ooh baby)
All over me, can you take control of me?
I just wanna love you, baby
Always thinking of you, baby

[Verse 2]
See, I don't know if I can handle you as just a friend
Aw baby, I can't pretend
Aw baby, I'm so far in
But I don't mind as long as I could have you in my life
Aw baby, I'm satisfied
Even if you're not just mine

[Chorus]
Can you rock with me? (Aw baby)
Nonstop with me, can you take it to the top with me?
I just wanna love you, baby (I wanna love you, babe)
Always thinking of you, babe (I'm thinking of you, babe)
Can you roll with me? (Ooh baby)
All over me, can you take control of me?
I just wanna love you, baby
Always thinking of you, baby

[Bridge]
Boy, you make me wanna say
(Aw baby, aw baby, ooh baby, ooh baby)
If you feel me, help me say
(Aw baby, aw baby, ooh baby, ooh baby)

[Chorus]
Can you rock with me? (Aw baby)
Nonstop with me, can you take it to the top with me?
I just wanna love you, baby (I wanna love you, babe)
Always thinking of you, babe (I'm thinking of you, babe)
Can you roll with me? (Ooh baby)
All over me, can you take control of me?
I just wanna love you, baby
Always thinking of you, baby
Can you rock with me? (Aw baby)
Nonstop with me, can you take it to the top with me?
I just wanna love you, baby (I wanna love you, babe)
Always thinking of you, babe (I'm thinking of you, babe)
Can you roll with me? (Ooh baby)
All over me, can you take control of me?
I just wanna love you, baby
Always thinking of you, baby

[Outro]
Love you, babe
Love you, babe
