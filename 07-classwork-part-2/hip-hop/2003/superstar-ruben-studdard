Long ago, and, oh, so far away
I fell in love with you before the second show
Your guitar, and you sound so sweet and clear
But you're not really here
It's just the radio

Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?
You said you'd be coming back this way again
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, I really do

Loneliness is such a sad affair, sad affair
And I can't hardly wait, baby, no i can't
To be with you again
What to say,to say
To make you come again?
Oooh honey
Come on back to me again, yeah
I wanna be, I wanna be anywhere you are oooh

Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?
You said you'd be coming back this way again
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby
I love you, oh baby
Don't you remember you told me you loved me baby?
You said you'd be coming back this way again
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I love you, I really do
