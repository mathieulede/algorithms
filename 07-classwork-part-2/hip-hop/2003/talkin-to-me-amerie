[Verse 1: Amerie]
Funny how it's hard to find the words sometimes you know
Wishin' we could read minds
Don't wanna let our feelings show
So even if you say you don't understand
I'm willing to give as much time as I can
Every time our eyes meet

[Chorus]
Every time our eyes meet
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (talkin' to me)
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', to me
Just ain't no need for words to speak (oh)
'Cause every time be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (talkin' to me)

[Verse 2]
Your always actin' so composed and cool
Never got to many words for me (Too many words)
You always turn your head and make sure I see (Just to make sure)
Baby ain't nothin' wrong with the love
That you and I dream of, so sweet
Your actions say more than your lips can speak
My friends say that they just can't see (they just can't see)
How a love unspoken can be so deep (can be so deep)
And every time that you look my way
I see what your heart wants to say to me

[Chorus with minor alterations] x2
Every time our eyes meet (oh yeah)
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (talkin' to me)
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', to me
Just ain't no need for words to speak (Ain't no need for words)
Cause every time
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (no no no no no)
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me

Every time our eyes meet (my eyes meet your, meet yours)
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', to me (to me)
Just ain't no need for words to speak, 'cause every time
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (every touch you give is like you're talkin' to me)
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', to me

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, yeah, oh
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin', to me
Oh, whoa, yeah
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me

[Chorus]
Every time our eyes meet (every time)
Be talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Talkin', talkin', talkin', talkin' to me (oh yeah, oh)
Just ain't no need for words to speak
'Cause every time (I hear you baby callin' me just ain't no need for words)
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me
Be talkin', talkin', talkin' to me

[Outro]
No need for words
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh oh
