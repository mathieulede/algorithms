[Joe talking....]
Na Na Na (Baby)
Na Na Na (you got that look on your face)
Na Na Na (Like you wanna go all night)
Na Na (And I like that)
Oh Oh Na Na Na (I just want you to know that um..)
Na Na Na (I ain't got no problem with that)
Na Na Na (just as long as we)
Na Na (go to the next level.)

[Verse 1:]
For as long as you're willing girl
Want you to know that I'm willing too
And where you want me to go girl
I'll be willing to go there for you
If you want me to take my time
I'll be willing to spend the night
All you gotta say is please stay Joe
And I'll be staying as long as you saying...

[Chorus:]
More and More
(Then after that you want)
More and more
(And after that)
More and more
(Then after that)
More, more

(I hear you saying)
More and more
(Then after that you want)
More and more
(Then after that)
More and more
(Then after that)
More, more

[Verse 2:]
If you want me to make your love come
I'll be willing to do anything
Even if you me to kiss places
I'll be willing to make you scream
Said I'm down for whatever you say
All you gotta do is speak your mind
Want me here Monday to Monday
Then baby girl its fine
As you screaming more..

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Girl we'll be going
From the bed to the floor baby
(then we'll be going)
From the bedroom to the kitchen
(Then we'll be going)
From the kitchen to the dining room
(Then straight to)
Straight to the living room
(I'll be taking you up)
Taking you up the stairs baby
(I guarantee)
Guarantee I'm bout to drive you crazy
We'll be all over the house
As long as you screaming for me, saying give me more..

[Repeat Chorus (1 time)]
All the ladies sing with me..
Na Na Na
Na Na Na
Na Na Na
Na Na...
