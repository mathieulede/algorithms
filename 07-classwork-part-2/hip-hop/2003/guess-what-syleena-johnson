I don't see no ring on this finger
So I'm not gonna deal with your drama
As long as your with me you gotta show respect
Get out and get a job and bring home a cheque
See, imma love you till the day i die
I never loved you enough that imma live a lie
Three snaps up, three snaps down
Wanna be treated like a king you better wear the crown

(CHORUS)
Wanna play the boss?
(guess what)
You better pay the cost
(Sho nuff)
Wanna wear the pants
(Guess what)
You gotta be the man
(Sho nuff)
Hangin' out wid' yo' friends?
(Guess what)
Better watch what time you come in
(Sho nuff)
Don't wanna pay the bills?
(Guess what)
I know somebody who will
(Sho nuff)

Now we been shackin' up since '93
I ain't gettin no younger, I need some guarantee
The best years of my life is what I've given you
Argue, fuss and fight seems like  all we do
And doing to church is always in your plans
Come sunday morning you play sick and dance
See imma love you till the day I die
I never love you enough that imma live a lie
So three snaps up, three snaps down
Wanna be treated like a king you better wear the crown

(CHORUS)
Think we got some issues at hand
We need to adress 'em baby, mm
I need you to understand
That I got needs too

Wanna be treated as a king you better wear the crown

(CHORUS TO FADE)
