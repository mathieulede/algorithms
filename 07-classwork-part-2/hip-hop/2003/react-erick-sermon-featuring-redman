[Intro]
Just Blaze, yeah
Check me out now
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Check me out now
Yo, yo, yo
Let me hear ya say
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Put your hands in the air everybody, c'mon
Where them dogs at

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
I'm immaculate, come through masculine
Wide-body frame, E-Dub's the name whoa
In the field of rap, I'm supurb, I'm fly
I should be in the sky with birds
I ride twenty inch rims when I lean yo
Hey yo them tens nigga
I know, I keep 'em clean though
Come through storming the block like El Ni√±o
Scoop up an Arabic chick before she close
She goes, those my people
Yeah them broads from Puerto Rico, them Keith's folks
Yeah watch how the E locs 64
Black rags, black interior, shift on the floor
Burn out, I do it for the kids
They're hopping the turnstyle, the E going wild
Yo like them White chicks on a DVD
Yeah I'm worldwide, MTV and BET, nigga

[Hook x2]
Whateva' she said then I'm that
If this here rocks to y'all then react

[Verse 2: Redman]
Do I gotta go ape or go nutty
I leave your eye like a 9-9 Benz-buggy, puffy
Brick niggas get real ugly
Trust me, keep your four if you feel lucky
Mug me, I ain't got nothing but four figures
And weed and hash chopped in the coffee blender
My shots like squeegy men on your window
Usual suspect, I'm the crippled member
Get away when I sat down in the office
Heat in my lap keep me walking awkward
While y'all talk it, the doc reinforce it
The mic, it's hard to keep my paws off it
Your bitch is my bitch when it's over
No Cristal, I pulled up a King Cobra
Out in the Nova, don't bother
My Nino Brown bust, it'll shut down the corridor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Erick Sermon]
Hey yo Red, he's over with his shit right now
Watch this, told you
Chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chi-chilling

[Redman]
I'm +Milk+ I'm that kid +Gizmo+, we Top Billing
Yo, when the roof is on fire, believe it, it's me
Sparks when I rock the mic like Sigel and Free
When the pen hit the pad, the evil in me come out
Total Recall for people to breathe
I got dogs in the backyard shitting their lawns

[Erick Sermon]
We got chickens ain't leaving till six in the morning

[Redman]
Round and round we go, circle the area

[Erick Sermon]
Leave the party, go straight to the Marriott

[Redman]
Dozy-doe with cowboys where they saddle at

[Erick Sermon]
Rodeo with twenty-fours on the Cadillac

[Erick Sermon]
What your name is, yo, R.E.D
Crack cost money, but the E is free, yeah

[Hook]
