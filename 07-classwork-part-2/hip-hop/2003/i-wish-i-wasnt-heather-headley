1st VERSE

Im home alone again
And you're out, hanging with your friends
So you say, somehow I know its not quite that way
Its getting pretty late, and you haven't checked on me all day
When I called, you didn't answer
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me
I wish,that you were home, holding me tight in your arms
I wish,I could go back, to the day before we met and skip my regret

CHORUS
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you dont deserve me
Wasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change
I wish I wasn't in love with you so I wouldn't feel this way

2nd VERSE

When you touch me my heart melts
And everything you did wrong I forget
So you play me and take advantage of the love that I feel for you
Why you wanna hurt me so bad
I believed in you thats why im so mad
Now Im drowning in dissapointment, and it's hard for me to even look at you
I wish, that you were home, holding me tight in your arms.Oooh baby
I wish, I could go back(ECHO)
To the day before we met and skip my regret

CHORUS

BRIDGE

Said you care about me, But from what I see
I ain't feeling that so I disagree
Gave you all my love and understanding
Yet you treated me like your enemy
So leave me alone, don't want nothin from ya
Just go back where you came from
This house is no longer your home
You're not welcome no,no,no,moreeeeeee

CHORUS (REPEAT 2X)

[Verse 3]
Hear you knockin' at the door again
I'm wonderin' should I let you in
I open up the door and see
The flowers for me
So
Beautiful in your hand
Please stop begging me to take you back
I've always been a sucker for romance
And before you know
It I concede
You're all over me
Oh no here I go again
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
