Down For Me

(Intro)
Oh yea oh yea
(it's your turn now kid)
Bad boy

(Chorus)
I want a woman thats down for me
I want a woman that'll take care of my body
(Loon)
I want a woman that'll wash my hair
Someone whos always there

I want a woman that'll show me things
Someone to fullfill my dreams
Settle down wit be my queen
Shes the only one for me

(Verse 1)
Yo ebony complexion, came in my direction
Eyes made connection, body was perfection
And got a smile that will light your life up
She make a thug put the guns and knives up
Defenitly the type of chick you wife up
Tennis skirts and nike up, throwin the bike up
1100 ducatti, ain't as fine as her body
Dont believe me, should have been at the party
U can tell wheter not was her hobby
The way niggas act, you would think j.lo in the lobby
Or, maybe beyonce maybe ashanti
The way i feel ma i need a fiance
The type of love that will last foreva
Not a chick thats around just for half my cheddar
Wanna play wanna laugh together
Even flash together, and girl you can get the cash wheneva (yeah)

(Chorus)
I want a woman thats down for me (oh yes i do)
I want a woman that'll take care of my body (my body)
I want a woman that'll wash my hair (ohh yea)
Someone whos always there (always there)

I want a woman that'll show me things (ohh yea)
Someone to fullfill my dreams (my dreams)
Settle down wit be my queen
Shes the only one for me

(Verse 2)
Uh..yeah..uh..yo..yo
When it comes to sex, im similar, to the thriller
In manilla, they call me young marcus im heartless
But baby girl im on a whole notha plateau
After i taste you i'll hit from the back slow
U can get it from the back mo
Until you hit a nigga back whoa
It was a fight tonight, im going out like mike tonite
I might bite tonite, you got a right to like
Wateva you want, tonites the nite
We gon be rite tonite, bottles on ice tonite
Teddy p barry white tonite (keep going)
Cause i adore you, and thats the reason why i spoil u
Foot massage body rub with the oil
I knew i wanted you first minute i saw u
And i was lucky to find a woman thats loyal
(lets go)

(Chorus)
I want a woman thats down for me (oh yes i do)
I want a woman that'll take care of my body (my body)
I want a woman that'll wash my hair (wash my hair)
Someone whos always there (and i'll wash urs to)

I want a woman that'll show me things (show me things)
Someone to fullfill my dreams (baby baby baby)
Settle down wit be my queen
Shes the only one for me

(Verse 3)
Uh yea come on uh yo ay yo
Ay yo the things that you showed me, the way you consoled me
The way that you used to hold me might have moled me
To the man that you see in the flesh
I promise you, i could neva be like the rest
Treat you like my moms, as far as the way that i love her
Feelings im feel inside like the day that i hugged her
Open up the door, i help her out with the bags
Car get dirty, i help her out the jag
Folks get flirty, i help em out with the mag
I ain't lyin, im in love wit you bad
Cause you something i neva had, something i wanna lose
Something i gotta have, its nothing for me to choose
But still i hope that i love get perfected
Even thou on the low it get hectic
Feelings we share dont need no correction
Let me be your angel and i'll be your protection (mario talk to em)

(Bridge)
Girl won't you take my hand (ohh) i'll help you understand (oh baby)
This could be love (oh yea) ohh this feels like love to me
Thats why you need to kno (to kno) oh please dont let this go (dont go)
I need your love (ohh) oh (ohh) girl give your love to me

(Chorus)
I want a woman thats down for me (oh i do)
I want a woman that'll take care of my body (ohh my body)
I want a woman that'll wash my hair (wash my hair)
Someone whos always there (oh baby baby)

I want a woman that'll show me things (oh show me things)
Someone to fullfill my dreams (fullfill my dreams)
Settle down wit be my queen (ohh baby)
Shes the only one for me

I want you baby i need you lady
