"Yow, can I talk to you for a minute?
Look, all I did was look
Why you trippin'?
Look, check this out
Check it
Baby look I'm tired of trying
To convince you that I ain't caught up lying
When she walked passed me I looked
So what? Big deal'
I don't understand how that
Can make you feel
That my love ain't for real

Every day I thank
The Lord above
That you're with me
You're with me
Tell me why would I throw that away?
Why would I throw that away?
How can I do it through
This is where I wanna be
Yeah
So I may look occasionaly
You're the only one I need

If I wanted That girl
Then I would be with That girl
That one ain't for me
She's fine as hell but she'll always be That girl
Nothing more than That girl
No matter what she do
She don't compare to you

What you yellin for
Why you screamin'
Girl you act as if you just caught me cheating
When you look at other men
And don't act like you don't
I don't tripp because I know
That I'm the guy you come home to every night

Everyday i thank
The Lord above
That you're with me
That you're with me
Tell me why would I throw that away?
Why would I throw that away?
What can I do to prove that
This is where I wanna be
Yeah
So I may look occasionally
You're the only one I need
If I wanted That girl
Then I would be with That girl
But that one ain't for me
She fine hell but she'll always be That girl
Nothing more than That girl
No matter what she do
She don't compare to you
Yeah

Check it

Know I
Need you
Right here with me
Oh I
Know I
Need you
No other girl will do
Cause I
Need you
Right here
With me
Oh I
Need you
