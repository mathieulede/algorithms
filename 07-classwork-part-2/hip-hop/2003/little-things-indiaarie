Been around the whole world
Still ain't seen
Nothin like my neighborhood
Out of all of the fancy satin and silk
My white cotton feels so good
Searched high and low
For a place where I can lay my burdens down
Ain't nothin in the whole wide world
Like the peace that I have found

Little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring
Little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring

Simple as a phone call
Just to make it known
That you're gonna be a little late
Pure as a kiss on the cheek
And a word that everything will be okay
Call in the morning from my little sister
Singing to me happy birthday
When you quest for fortune and fame
Don't forget about the simple things

Little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring
Little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring

Give some good food, give me some cute shoes
Give me some peace of mind
Give me some sunshine, give me some blue skies

Runnin round in circles
Lost my focus
Lost sight of my goals
I do this for the love of music
Not for the glitter and gold
Got everything that I prayed for
Even a little more
When I asked to learn humility
This is what I was told

Little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring
Little things (its the little things)
And the joy they bring

Give me my guitar, give me a bright star
Give me some good news, give me some cute shoes
Give me Atlanta, give me Savannah
Give me my peace of my mind
Give me some Stevie, give me some Donnie
Give me my Daddy, give me my Mommy
Pour me some sweet tea, spoonful of honey
I don't need no hollywood
