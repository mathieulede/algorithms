Hmmmmmmmm...... Hey yea hey... Hoooooowhooo.... Baby

[Verse:]
Kind of like a summer's breeze
You do exactly as you please
Drop a brother to his knees just for fun
I think it was the first of May
Girl I can't forget the day
Right then and there I knew you were the one
Do you think that possibly
You could spend your life with me
Cuz girl this love is growing, and it's hotter than the sun

[Chorus:]
I get a little bit crazy baby
Everytime you call my name
My heart beats a little bit faster
After, you are in my arms again
You try to fight it
Don't even try to hide it
Emotions falling down like the rain
I can't find the words to explain it
Ain't it, crazy how I fall
Everytime you call my name

[Verse 2:]
It's kind of like a work of art
You shot an arrow through my heart
Even though we're worlds apart I can't deny
It feels like your apart
Of me the finish and the start of me
Girl you are the heart of me
And that's no lie
Did I mention that I love you so
And I just want the world to know
If I could you kno I would write your name across the sky

[Chorus:]
Crazy, crazy...
Evertime that your close to me
I lose control of my sanity
Everynight, everyday, every word and you say
Girl do you know you put a spell on me

[Chorus:]
Crazy
Everytime you call my name
I don't know what to do
I'm so in love with you
