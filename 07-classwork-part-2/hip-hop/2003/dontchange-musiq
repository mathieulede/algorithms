[Verse 1]
Lately you've been questioning
If I still see you the same way
Cause through these trying years
We gonna both physically change

Now don't you know you you'll always be
The most beautiful woman I know
So let me reassure you darlin that
My feelings are truly unconditional

[Chorus]
See I'll love you when your hair turns gray, girl
I'll still want you if you gain a little weight, yeah
The way I feel for you will always be the same
Just as long as your love don't change, No

I was meant for you and you were meant for me, yeah
And I'll make sure that I'll be everything you need, yeah
Girl the way we are is how its gonna be
Just as long as your love don't change

[Verse 2]
Cause I'm not impressed, more or less
By them girls in the T.V and magazines
Cause honestly I believe that your beauty
Is way more than skin deep
Cause everything about you makes me feel
I have the greatest gift in the world
And even when you get on my last nerve
I couldn't see myself being with another girl

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
So don't waste your time worryin bout
Small things that ain't relevant to me
Cause to my understanding your all I want and need
See what I'm tryin to say is I'm here to stay
And as long as your love doesn’t change, then

Baby darling I swear that I,
I swear I ain't going nowhere no.
[Chorus]

[Vamp]
You’re my baby, yeah
Don't you change baby, no
Baby you gotta understand that I love you baby, yeah
Don’t you know, you gotta know
You’ve got to know
Yeah, yeah
