"Love Calls"

I'm sittin' here thinkin' about you tonight
And all that you mean to me
I used to think I would never fall in love again
I guess I was wrong

When your heart was broken
When your wounded pride was laid to rest, baby
You'll never open your heart to anyone else you said
But you lied, I know you're lyin' tome

You see your mind might be made up, mmm
But your heart has got it's own plans
There's no one to blame for false pride, tellin' lies
Tryin' to hide
From feelin' the pain, I know you don't wanna feel it

There's nowhere to hide when the love is callin' your
Name, yeah
From the dark, babe, nowhere to hide, baby
There's nowhere to hide, so let love have it's way
With your heart
When love calls, love calls, love calls your name

It's on my lips
And I wish that you were still here
To take me away with your kiss
And take me away from all this crazy, crazy

Cause too many words have been spoken, mmm
Too many lies have been told, baby
You'll never do it again you told yourself over and
Over and over
You're wrong, dead wrong, babe, yeah

There's nowhere to hide, mmm, when love is callin'
Your name
In from the dark, baby, nowhere to run, girl
There's nowhere to hide, yeah, so let love have its
Way, girl, with your heart, babe
Love calls, love calls

There's nowhere to hide, yeah, when love calls your
Name
You fall apart, baby
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run when love is on its
Way, girl, to your heart, baby
When love calls, love calls your name, babe

Love's callin' your name, hey, hey
It's callin' out for, callin' out for me, baby
Love's on its way, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm sittin' here thinkin' about you tonight
And how you make me feel
The sweetness of your touch
The softness of your voice, mmm
You make me wanna be a better man, baby
And I wanna thank you for calling me into your life
Into your arms, into your love
