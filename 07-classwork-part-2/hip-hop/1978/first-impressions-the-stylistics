You know when I first laid eyes on you
I remember saying that first impressions are everlasting

First impressions are misleading
That's what they say
Sweet affections should grow slowly
And steady and deeper every day

And I may be reachin' for a star
I should take the time to know you better
Don't know who you really are
But here we are

Magic moments don't come easy
I could be wrong
But this feeling keeps on flowin'
And growin' and comin' on real strong

Though I don't know who you really are
Tonight I got to feel my arms around you
Maybe reaching for a star
But here we are

Got to go with first impression
First impressions can sometimes lead to love

Well, junior how about it once again
For the guys and the band the Style Orchestra

Got to go with first impression
First impressions can sometimes lead to love
Lead to love
