Come on

You, you got, you got
You got what I want
You got, you got, you got what I need
Only you, baby, only you
Only you, you, you, you, you

I ain't never had nobody
Love me like you do
I ain't never had nobody
Please me through and through
I ain't never had nobody
Talk to me this way

Nobody even comes close
When it comes to loving me

You, come on, you got, you got
You got what I want
You got, you got, you got what I need
Only you, baby, only you
Only you, you, you, you, you

I ain't never had nobody
In my life before
I ain't never had nobody
Get me the key to the door
I ain't never had nobody
Take away my troubles

When I'm down and out, girl
You come running on the double

You, you got, you got
You got what I want
You got, you got, you got what I need
Only you, baby, only you
Only you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you

I ain't never had nobody
Love me like you do
I ain't never had nobody
Please me through and through
I ain't never had nobody
Talk to me this way

Nobody even comes close
When it comes to loving me

You, you got, you got
You got what I want, yes, you do
You got, you got, you got what I need
Only you, baby, only you, only you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

You got, you got, you got, you got
You got what I want
You got, you got, you got, you got
You got what I need, yes, you do

Only you, you, only you, you
Only you, you got, you got
You got what I want
You got, you got, you got
