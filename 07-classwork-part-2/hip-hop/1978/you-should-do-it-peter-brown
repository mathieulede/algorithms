You should do it right
Each and every night
If you're gonna do it
You should do it right

You should do it good
Like you know you should
If you're gonna do it
You should do it good

I feel the beat, it moves my feet
It makes me wanna fly
So if it's right
I'll stay all night
I'll never say goodbye

Da da da da...

You should do it slow
Only way to go
If you're gonna do it
You should do it slow

You should do it nice
(You got to do it nice)
Just take my advice
If you're gonna do it
You should do it nice

You should do it slow
(Come on) only way to go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If you're gonna do it
You should do it slow

You should do it nice
(You got to do it nice)
Just take my advice
If you're gonna do it
You should do it nice
