Workin' on my feet in the disco heat
Dancin' through the night 'til mornin' light shines on me, again
Music makes me dance, dance, dance, dance

Dancin's total freedom
Be yourself and choose your feelin'
Come on get up wanna see some
Swingin', swayin', movin', groovin', slidin', glidin'
Rockin', reelin', come on get up ev'rybody dance

Workin' on my feet in the disco heat
Dancin' through the night 'til mornin' light shines on me, again
Music makes me dance, dance, dance, dance

Dancin's total freedom
Be yourself and choose your feelin'
Come on get up wanna see some
Swingin', swayin', movin', groovin', slidin', glidin'
Rockin', reelin', come on get up ev'rybody dance, dance

Dance with me in the disco heat
Dance with me in the disco heat
Dance with me in the disco heat
Dance with me in the disco heat

Dance with me in the disco heat

Dance with me in the disco heat, come on and dance
Dance with me in the disco heat

Dance with me in the disco heat, come on and dance
Dance with me in the disco heat, come on and dance
