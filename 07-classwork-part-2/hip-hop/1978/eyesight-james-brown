If you see something that don't belong to you
Be careful what you say or mind what you do
'Cause late one night somebody called ya outside the door
Your eyesight yeah

If you see something that don't belong to you
Be careful what you say or mind what you do
One day or late one night, somebody gonna
Destroy your eyesight

You better change your mind
And get yourself off that unemployment line
