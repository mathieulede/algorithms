A humping we will go
A bumping we will go
We'll take some funk
We'll put in it in your rump
And then we'll make you disco

The 'Mothership Connection' is here
The 'Mothership Connection' is here
The 'Mothership Connection' is here

Ooh, giving up the funk
Ooh, giving up the funk
Ooh, giving up the funk
Ooh, giving up the funk

Old McDonald had some rumps, E-I-E-I-O
But what's some rumps without some funk, E-I-E-I-O
No humping here, there's no bumping
Everywhere there's a lack of funking
E-I-O Disco, McDonald, E-I-O to go

Old MacDonald had a barn, E-I-E-I-O
And in that barn he has a dance floor, E-I-O, disco to go
He charged the chicks to do the chicken
Pigs would pay the price of pork, E-I-O, disco to go
Ooh, giving up the funk, ooh, giving up the funk

Old MacDonald had some rumps, E-I-E-I-O
But what's some rumps without some funk, E-I-E-I-O
No humping here, there's no bumping
Everywhere there's a lack of funking

He charged the chicks to do the chicken
Pigs would pay the price of pork
And old MacDonald would do the esso
Singing E-I-O, disco to go
A sort of carry out disco, you know, darling
