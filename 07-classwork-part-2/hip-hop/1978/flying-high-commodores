Flyin' high on a feelin'
Flyin' high
Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love

I knew we could make it from the beginning
The first time I saw you passing by, whoa
To me it was much more than a notion
It was the fire in your eyes

Flyin' high on a feelin'
Flyin' high
Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love

Your face has a glow, girl, like a sunrise
You speak in a whisper like the wind, whoa
And when I touch you, I see clearly
That we can be more than just friends

Ooh, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
(Yeah, baby)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
(Whoa)

(Flyin' higher for your love)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
(Hey, flyin' higher for your love)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Flyin' high on a feelin'
Flyin' high
Flyin' high on a good thing
Flyin' high on your love

On your love
(On your love)
On your love
(On your love)
On your love, yeah
(On your love)

Oh, oh, sweet darling
Oh, wanna say
(Flyin')
Your love takes me higher, oh
(Higher)
Say it again, oh, oh, oh, ooh
(Flyin' higher, higher, flyin' higher)
Say it again
(Flyin')
Oh, sweet lady, hey hey, oh
(Higher, flyin', higher, higher, higher)
