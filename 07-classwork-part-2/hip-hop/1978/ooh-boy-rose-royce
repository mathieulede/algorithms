Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

I watch you walk by my window
And I don't even know your name
But my heart skips a beat and I feel weak
When my eyes tell my heart he comes again

There's so many things I want to say
But each time I see you boy
The words just seem to fade away
Infatuation, love at first sight
I don't know I just know that the feeling is right

Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

There's talk going around town
They say you love a girl and then you put her down
I hope with all my heart that it's not true
'Cause boy I'd wanna share my love with you

I know that's it not right
Nor is it lady-like
For a girl to come right out
And tell a guy how she feels
But I want you to know that deep down in my soul
I'm experiencing something wonderful and new

And it's...
You boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too

When I go to bed at night
I hold my pillow tight
Pretending that it's you
And if I had one wish and wishes came true
I wish to be able to say these words to you

Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Oooh boy, I hope with all my might
You feel the same way too

Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy, I wish I could make this dream come true

Ooh boy, I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Oooh boy, I hope with all my might
You feel the same way too
