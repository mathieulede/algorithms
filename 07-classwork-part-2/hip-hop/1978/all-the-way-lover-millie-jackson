After that, she called up here talking about she gonna find her another man
I think she got kind of upset because I didn't agree with her
But hell, I just told her what was on my mind
MAN ON PHONE: You know I knew, baby. I can't imagine what you told her
Well, I just had to tell her the way I felt about it
Cheatin' is a thing that starts when you bring two lonely people face to face with another kid
She blames him, he blames her
But neither one isn't quite sure what she really is
And all of the time in the back of their mind
You know they're gonna lie about where they've been
Cheatin' is a thing that'll take away the pain
And bringin' in the pieces that'll never go together again
Cheatin' is a part of lovin' that starts when true love isn't what lovers were lookin' for
A stranger here, a stranger there
You turn around and swear that you'll never go back for more
And lyin' at night when you're holdin' him tight
Something in a cheater's heart just has to learn
Cheatin' is a thing that's guaranteed to bring two unhappy lovers to the point of no return
The worst is she leaves two sad little kids hangin' in the middle while mama and daddy choose
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins
And the ones not big enough to play are the ones to lose
Cheatin' is a game where nobody wins
And the ones not big enough to play are the ones to lose
Mmmmmmmmmmmm. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Mmmmmmm, hmmmmmmm, mmmmmmmmmm
