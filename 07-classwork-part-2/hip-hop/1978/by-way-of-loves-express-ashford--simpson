Hopin', prayin', oh, it's got to get through

Honey, I miss you and I don't want to cry
That's why this letter's been sealed and certified
And when it gets there, it'll all be explained
When it gets there, you know why I signed my name

Hopin', prayin', oh, it's got to get through

You may not hear my distant call
But it will arrive even if the sky should fall
And when it gets there, oh, you'll know what I mean
When it gets there you'll tell the train to put on a lil' more steam

Engine, don't you break down
Engine, don't you break down
Faster, make your whistle sound
Faster, make your whistle sound

Oh, train, with the speed of light you bear
Hurry, train, my baby's got to know how much I care
Hurry, train, hurry, train, hurry, train, hurry
