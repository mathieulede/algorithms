I love you, girl

You and me, we'll be together
Loving you forever
We'll always be together

We'll depend on love to guide us
Through any kind of weather
And that's when they get better

Life has so much to give
When you find love and it's real

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I love you, girl

In our world, we'll live as one
Denying all others
Bringing joy to one another

With the light of faith and trust to guide us
The patient understanding
Will keep our love expanding

Love has filled our heart
And we'll ne-never part, ooh

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I love you, girl

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
