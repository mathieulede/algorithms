Don't cost You nothing (2x)

Think, think about the way of rejection
You're not the only one reaching for perfection
Think, think about the reason you exist
I got something You might not wanna miss

Don't cost You nothing (2x)

You just think, think about Your point of view
You don't have to get involved
No one's forcing You
Hey, stop, stop and listen to the voice
Good God alive, You always got a choice

Chorus:
Don't cost you nothing
Take a chance as You go
Don't cost You nothing
If you like it
Come back for more

Repeat Chorus

I ain't selling Myself to You, baby
The way that others often do
People You know call Me crazy
They determine what I offer You
It don't cost you nothing

Repeat Chorus

I ain't selling Myself to You, baby
The way that others often do
People You know call Me crazy
They determine what I offer You
It don't, it don't, it don't cost You
It don't, it don't, it don't cost you nothing

Repeat Chorus
