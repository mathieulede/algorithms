[Verse 1]
When I wake up in the morning, love
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
And something without warning, love
Bears heavy on my mind

[Hook]
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
A lovely day

[Verse 2]
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

[Hook]
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
A lovely day

[Verse 2]
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

[Hook]
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
(a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day)
A lovely day a lovely day a lovely day a lovely day...
A lovely day
