Midnight sun
Shining through my darkest night
Noonday shadow
Blocking out my morning light
You don't even know what I'm talking about
It's what you do when you're just being you

How can you be daylight & darkness at the same time?
Oh, baby
How can you be daylight & darkness at the same time?

Flaming candle, hey
Burning in your sweet desire
Eyes of coal
Hard to handle
Back and forward from ice to fire
You don't even know what you're putting me through
With all these bitter sweet things that you do

How can you bee daylight & darkness at the same time? Oh
How can you be daylight & darkness at the same time

Oh, baby, oh baby
You don't even know what I'm talking about
It's just your way baby, that's what you say
How can you be daylight & darkness...
Same time
How can you be daylight & darknessa t the same time?
Ah daylight, daylight, daylight
Daylight

Ooo hoo, darkness, darkness, darkness
Time
How can you be daylight & darkness, at the same time?
Same time, same time, my baby
Ah, at the same time
