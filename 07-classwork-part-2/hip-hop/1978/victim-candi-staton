When I started out
It was just a matter of seeing you every day
I looked forward to the times
When you would come my way, oh yes
I longed just to see you
Wore a smile just to greet you
I'm a victim of the very song I sing
You gave me a brand new reason
To start fixing up my face
Having cocktails at your favorite place
A table just for two
Got rid of loneliness, now that I have you
I became a victim of the very song I sing
I told you young hearts run free
When I didn't listen to myself
Engulfed by the power of love
I just fell right in, right on in
Wasn't hardly worried about tomorrow
You're the future
As long as I was being satisfied
I didn't need nothing else
And now already, I'm being left at home
I wonder what it is
That makes a man leave a girl so alone
Another woman is the thing
Running around, it just don't seem to change
Victim, victim, victim, victim
I'm a victim of the very song I sing
Why don't you practice what you preach
That's what everybody's telling me
If my advice is good for others
It's got to be good for me
So I try to occupy my mind
Keep myself busy all the time
But the more I try to do
The more I keep thinking of you
Oh well, I guess I'll end up in the lost and found
Looks like love and me
We done fought another round
Another woman is his claim to fame
And I'm lucky if I can break these chains
Victim...
Help me sing do do wap, oh oh do do wap
