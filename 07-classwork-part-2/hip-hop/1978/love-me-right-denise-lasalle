Whoo! What time is it?
Ooh, I got to hurry up and get on this red dress
The one that fit real tight
I got to put my wig on, my high-heeled shoes
'Cause I got to be lookin' good, honey

People wanna hear him sing, all the hits he made down through the years
It's gonna be all right
At the blues party tonight

Greens and cornbread
