I make my livin' on the run
My life is lonely but I was born to need no one
Always on my own, ohh
My gun is loaded
I'm a six-shot heart attack
I pull the trigger
So you better watch your back
Lookin' out for number one
So you had better take this piece of advice
Make your move
Stick 'em up or kiss your a** goodbye
Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
I got the drop on you so raise them high
Reach for the sky
Well it's a showdown
This is what I do for fun
I got a reputation
Yeah I'm the fastest gun
I'm livin' on the highway
Movin' on from town to town
You better do it my way
Or I will shoot you down
Lookin' out for number one
So you had better take this piece of advice
Make your move
Stick 'em up or kiss your a** goodbye
Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
I got the drop on you so raise them high
Reach for the sky
Take your best shot
So you think you're fast enough?
Oh go for your guns baby, oh
Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
Or I will shoot you down in the blink of an eye
Reach for the sky
There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Reach for the sky
I've got the drop on you so raise them high
Reach for the sky
Whoa reach for the sky
