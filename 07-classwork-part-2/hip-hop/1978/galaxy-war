Take me to your place in space
I'm simply tired of mad rage
On rocket ship no time to wait
I just want to gravitate

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

I'll take you out to see the place
Where the man and the moon have a smilin' face
Oh yeah
You don't have to wear no fancy lace
Just a funky feel and a lot of taste

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

People movin' to and fro
To a song, a band, and a lazy show
Superman, batman, goin' all night
Playin' one on one with a meteor light

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
It's gone, gone, gone

Ninth dimension, seventh lane
I'll get raised in solar cane
The star patrol said keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down, keep it down
As long as the rule when you stay in town
As long as the rule where you stay around

It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's out of sight
(It's out of sight)
It's gone
(In the galaxy)
It's gone
(At the galaxy)
