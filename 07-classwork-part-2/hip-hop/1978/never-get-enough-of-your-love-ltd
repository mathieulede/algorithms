So you say I'm the perfect girl for you
And there's no one that you desire more
Until the end of time, you promise to protect me, respect me
Until the day you die
Well let me tell you about it, y'all
(hey) My momma told me not to trust you
You lying, ya no good, hang out in the hood
They say the cops are gonna bust you
Smoking, selling(?) nickels and dimes, and that ain't all
Well, why you gotta flirt with every girl in a skirt?
Why you got to scratch that itch?
You're never around, always putting me down
You self-centered son-of-a- (Watch your mouth!)
You say you're with your boys all night
Play me like I'm a fool
Well I

Chorus: I can't get enough of your love
No matter how hard I try
Can't get enough of your love
Every morning afternoon and night
Can't get enough of your love, your love
Hey, you're about to drive your baby crazy
Come over to eat, you come in, you sleep
You're trifling, two-faced and lazy
Sneaking, drinking 40's and wine
I hate the way that you do it
Well I (I'm telling you now)

Chorus: I can't get enough of your love
No matter how hard I try
I can't get enough of your love
Every morning, afternoon and night
Can't get enough of your love, your love
[spoken] Ladies and gentleman, my piano player, Raymond Crosley
Oh he is so bad, he's bad to the bone
(I'm telling you now)

Chorus: I can't get enough of your love
No matter how hard I try
I can't enough of your love
Every morning, afternoon and night
Can't get enough of your love, your love
Don't you know that I don't give a damn
About the things they say about you
'cuz your love is all that really matters to me
Nobody gives it to me like you do
The way that you do me just makes me scream
I'll give you anything you want to keep you here with me

Chorus: I can't get enough of your love
No matter how hard I try
I can't enough of your love
Every morning, afternoon and night
Can't get enough of - Can't get enough of - Can't get enough of your love, your love
Of your love, uh-huh
