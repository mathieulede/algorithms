You were meant for me
No one else could come between this love, I know
Cause I'll never let you go

You and me...it seems
Never have a problem we can't overcome
Cause you'll always be the one

Never thought I'd be so happy
Loving you has made feel so fine
I can see my friends turn green with envy
Everytime I tell them, I'm so glad you're mine

You were meant for me
No one else could come between this love, I know
Cause I'll never let you go

You and me it seems...never have a problem we can't overcome
Cause you'll always be the one....yeah

Never did one thing to hurt me
You always understood my ways
If I could, I'll stay right here beside you
With your hand in mine, making love for days

You were meant for me
No one else could come between this love, I know
Cause I'll never let you go

You were meant for me
