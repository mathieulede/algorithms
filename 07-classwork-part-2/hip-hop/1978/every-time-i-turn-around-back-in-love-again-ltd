Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love
I get mixed emotions
It's the way my feelings flow
Excuse me, I'm only human
Sometimes I, I just don't know
Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again
Doo doo doo doo doo
Back in love again
Doo doo doo doo doo
Back in love
When you put your arms around me
I feel so satisfied
I want to love you forever
I just can't, I can't decide
Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
Every time I turn around
I'm back in love again
Right back, right back
In love again (Alright)
Seems like, seems like
Back in love again
Now it's your lover
I know it's hard just to be a friend
That's something else I discovered
I guess I just don't ever want it to end
Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
Every time I turn around
I'm back in love again
Right back, right back
In love again
Seems like, seems like
That I'm back in love again
Right back, right back (Oh, yeah)
In love again (Alright)
Seems like, seems like
I'm back in love again
I just don't believe it
Back in love again
{Right back, I'm back} I can't believe it
{Right back, I'm back} Every time I turn around
Back in love again
{Right back, I'm back} I get so many mixed emotions
I'm back in love again
{Right back, I'm back} Every time I turn around
Oh, my love Jones comin' down
Back in love again
{Right back, I'm back} Alright, alright, alright
(I'm back, I'm back) Help me, help me, help me, back in love
