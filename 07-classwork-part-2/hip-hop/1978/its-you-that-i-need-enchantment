Something strange is happening
You don't belong to me anymore
It seems I'm all alone
In my dreams, yeah

I just feel so weak
No one knows the pain I see
And I'm all alone
Now that you're gone

My world is cold
My friends are few
Without you here
My joy seems cruel

When you left
You took part of me
What can I do?

It's you that I need (baby, baby)
It's you that I need (I'm lonely)
It's you that I need, come back

Something's gone in me
You were my life
My mystery, baby
How could you do this to me?
Left me holding on to a memory

I tried
I tried to be good
Take you to a place no others could
I suddenly woke and found you gone
Now I sing my heart to you
Through the words of this song

Something happened to me
You were my life, my destiny
My life will never, ever be complete
Come back to me

It's you that I need (baby, baby)
It's you that I need (I'm lonely, yeah)
It's you that I need (come on)
Come back home

It's you that I need
It's you that I need
It's you that I need right now
It's you that I need, yeah, yeah, oh

It's you (you) that I need, baby (baby)
It's you (you) that I need (baby)
It's you (you) that I need (baby)
It's you (you) that I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, baby
It's you that I need
(All I need, baby)
Baby, baby
It's you that I need
(Something's happening, baby)

Baby, baby
It's you that I need
Baby, baby
It's you that I need
(Baby, come see about me, yeah)

Baby, baby
It's you that I need
Baby, baby
It's you that I need
