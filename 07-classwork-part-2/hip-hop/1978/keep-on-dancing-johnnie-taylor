You think I love you for just one thing
To you my love this may be the way it seems
But I love the way that you carry yourself
I even dig the way you wear your hair
Ain't that loving you
Ain't that loving you for more reasons than one
Somehow, my love you've been misled
By the things that other men have said
But I love you for what you are
I even love you for what you may become
Ain't that loving you
Ain't that loving you for more reasons than one
Oh yes I do
Did it ever occur to you
Why I do all that any man can do?
To keep a smile on your face
It's because I love you
I love you, I love you in so many ways
Somehow, my love you've been misled
By the things that other men have said
But I love you for what you are
I even love you, I love you
I love you for what you may become
Ain't that loving you
Ain't that loving you for more reasons than one
Don't you know I love you?
Lips of my heart, I love you darling
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, love you
For more reasons, I got more than one reason why I love you
I love you because you know how to suite me
I love you because you know
