[Hook] x2
Holding on...is very hard to do
When love is gone...and that's no lie
Holding on...is very hard to do
When love is gone!

[Verse 1]
I betcha you’re unhappy
I know you gotta be
‘Cause it can drive you outcha mind
There ain’t no sense in crying
It's time for you to leave
And baby that’s the bottom line
I betcha lie awake nights, and never rest a bit
And wish it all would disappear
But still the bottom line is you got to deal with it
And to yourself at least be fair

[Hook] x2

[Bridge] x4
Ha, ha, ha, who are you kidding?
Do do do do do

[Hook] x2

I betcha you’re unhappy
I know you gotta be
‘Cause it can drive you outcha mind
There ain't no sense in crying
It’s time for you to leave
And baby that’s the bottom line
I betcha lie awake at nights, and never rest a bit
And wish it all would disappear
But still the bottom line is you got to deal with it
And to yourself at least be fair

[Hook] x2

Well you know when the feelings gone
Then you've got to stop holding on
Cause that makes it twice as bad
You can’t give love that you don’t have
So why drag it on and on and on
Holding on....
