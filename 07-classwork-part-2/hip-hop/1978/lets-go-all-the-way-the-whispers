All the way
Let's go, let's go all the way
Don't be afraid
Let's go, let's go all the way

All the way
Let's go, let's go all the way
Don't be afraid
Let's go, let's go all the way

I like the way you make love to my mind
The things you say are always right on time
You brighten up my day with your sunshine

Now I feel the friendship growin'
Each day it's growin' and growin'
I can't wait till we'll be goin'
To love land

All the way
(All the way)
Let's go, let's go all the way
(Don't you ever be afraid)
Don't be afraid
(Just put your trust in me)
Let's go, let's go all the way
(Won't you take my hand)

All the way
(Cause you know that I love you, girl)
Let's go, let's go all the way
(And you know that I need you)
Don't be afraid
(All we need, all we need is each other)
Let's go, let's go all the way

Let's take a drive to Santa Monica
You bring the wine and I'll bring my guitar
Lay on the beach and look up at the stars

Now I feel the friendship growin'
It's growin' and growin' and growin'
All the way, baby
To love land, come on

You have a special kind of sex appeal
I just can't find the words to say how I feel
You know I know you know my love is real

Now I feel the friendship growin'
It's growin' and growin' and growin'
Can't wait till we'll be goin'
To love land

All the way
(All the way, baby, let's go all the way)
Let's go, let's go all the way
(Come on, I swear I'll never hurt you, girl)
Don't be afraid
(Please put your trust in me)
Let's go, let's go all the way
(We've got to, got to go)

All the way
(I want to know when we're goin')
Let's go, let's go all the way
(Cause I want to make love to you, baby)
Don't be afraid
(I don't want you to ever be afraid)
Let's go, let's go all the way
(Ooh hoo trust me, baby)

All the way
(Cause I love you, girl, trust me, girl)
Let's go, let's go all the way
(I'll be so gentle)
Don't be afraid
(I don't want you to ever go nowhere)
Let's go, let's go all the way (Woo hoo hoo)

All the way
(Said I want you, said I need you, gotta have you, gonna get ya)
Let's go, let's go all the way
(Let's go all the way, all the way, girl, come on)
Don't be afraid
(I really, really love you, girl)
Let's go, let's go all the way
(I want to make love to you, baby)

All the way
