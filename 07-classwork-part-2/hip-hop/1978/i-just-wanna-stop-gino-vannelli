[Verse 1]
For your love
When I think about those nights in Montreal
I get the sweetest thoughts of you and me
Memories of love above the city lights
Ooh, I tried so hard to take it
But oh lord my heart won't make it

[Chorus]
I just wanna stop
And tell you what I feel about you babe
I just wanna stop
I never wanna live without you babe
I just gotta stop
For your love

[Verse 2]
When I think about the way the world must turn
I get the saddest thoughts for you and me
Memories of life and times go on and on
Ooh, Ive tried hard to forget it
But of lord my mind won't let it

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ooo, Ive tried so hard to take it
But oh lord my heart won't make it

[Chorus]
