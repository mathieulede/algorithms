I'm riding high
I'm riding down the highway
I'm riding high
I can't feel my body
I'm riding high
There's a funk in the freezer
I'm riding high
I want to take you home to trip with me
Can't free my mind
Wanna take you on a love high
Can't free my mind
Wanna take you on a love high

I'm riding high
Everybody is a love junkie
I'm riding high
It's not a drug that makes you happy
I'm riding high
I don't know what to do
I'm riding high
And I want to make some love with you
Can't free my mind
Wanna take you on a love high
Can't free my mind
Wanna take you on a love high

Do you feel what I feel
Do you know that it's real
Every time I touch you girl
My mind is in a whirl
'Cause I'm a love junkie for you girl
