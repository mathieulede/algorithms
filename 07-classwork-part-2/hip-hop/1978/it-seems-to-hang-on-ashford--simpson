Is it daylight, I can't tell no more
Never had this condition before

Everywhere I turn (It seems to hang on)
Everything I do (It seems to hang on)
Was I mistaken (It seems to hang on)
About you (It seems to hang on)

Aside from wantin' you (It seems to hang on)
Aside from needin' you (It seems to hang on)
Let me give you some idea (It seems to hang on)
It ain't just the tears, the fact of it is

I can't go nowhere
I can't be the same
I don't know my name
I can't understand just why

(It seems to hang on) Oh, ooh, why
(It seems to hang on)

Wasn't I clever
As only I can be
But tell me what's happenin'
What's botherin' me, yeah, yeah

Aside from dreams I had
Nothin' else exists
Honey, it's you I miss
Don't leave me like this

I can't go nowhere
I can't be the same
I don't know my name
I can't understand just why

(It seems to hang on) Why
(It seems to hang on)

Like a snowball rollin' down the hill (It seems to hang on)
I look behind me, it's there still (It seems to hang on)
Ooh, like a shadow it follows
Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...

Oh...loose me, loose me, loose me please

I can't go nowhere
I can't be the same
I don't know my name
I can't understand just why

(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on) I can't shake it
(It seems to hang on) I can't shake it
(It seems to hang on)

Like a snowball rollin' down the hill (It seems to hang on)
I look behind me, it's there still (It seems to hang on)
Ooh, it follows like a shadow
Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...

Oh...loose me, loose me, loose me please, please
Please
{Hey} Hey

I can't go nowhere
I can't be the same
I don't know my name
I can't understand just why, why

(It seems to hang on) {Oh, oh} Why
(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on) {Was it} Was it

(It seems to hang on) {Was it} Was it
(It seems to hang on) {Baby, was it love}
(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on)

(It seems to hang on) {I wanna know}
(It seems to hang on) I wanna know
(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on)

(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on)

(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on)
(It seems to hang on)
