I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I want to go to a different land
I try my best to understand
The different traditions
And customs that people have
The world is bigger than this ole town
I wanna get my feet up off the ground
I've saved up my money
I'm leavin' here today
'Cause I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I want to get a first class seat
Climbin' so high, upto forty thousand feet
It don't take long
To get where I wanna go
I'm gonna have myself a ball
This ole world I wanna see it all
I got my clothes packed
I'm leavin' right away
'Cause I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin', goin', goin'
Goin', goin', goin', goin', goin'
The world is bigger than this ole town
I wanna get my feet up off the ground
I've saved up my money
I'm leavin' right away
'Cause I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin', goin', goin'
Goin', goin', goin', goin', goin'
Goin', goin', goin', goin'
Goin', goin', goin', goin'
Feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
I like the feelin' I get
When I'm ridin' in a jet
Say I'm goin' places
