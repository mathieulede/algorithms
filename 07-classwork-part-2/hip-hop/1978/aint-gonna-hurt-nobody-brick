Move a groove, nice and easy
Feels so good
They're in my bones

Dance, dance, dance to the music
Get down, get down and sing along
The most accurate lyrics site on the net

'Cause it ain't gonna hurt
Nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody
To get on down
It in't gonna hurt nobody
To get on down

Don't stop me
And I won't stop you

Someone said that it was ten to four
It's not too late to throw some more
Time keeps ticking away
Come on and let's get down today

'Cause it ain't gonna hurt
Nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody
To get on down
It in't gonna hurt nobody
To get on down
Don't stop me

'Cause it ain't gonna hurt
Nobody to get on down
It ain't gonna hurt nobody
To get on down
It in't gonna hurt nobody
To get on down
Don't stop me
And I won't stop you
