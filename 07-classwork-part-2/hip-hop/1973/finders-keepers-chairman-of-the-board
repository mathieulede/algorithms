I found the love
You threw away
Now you realize
You made a mistake

But now she's mine
And we're doing fine
You can't steal her love
No use in trying

Your eyes may shine
Your teeth may grit
But none of this love
Are you gonna get

[Chorus]
Finder's keepers, losers weepers
I found the love you lost
And I'm gonna keep her
Finder's keepers, losers weepers
I found the love you lost
And I'm gonna keep her

This love of mine is super fine
Lord knows I'm glad
I made her mine

You treat her bad
You know you made her sad
Now you realize
The good thing you had

But it's too late
Don't even try
Never gonna give her up
And I ain't lying

[Repeat Chorus]
Your eyes may shine
Your teeth may grit
But none of this love
Are you gonna get

[Repeat Chorus]
