Well he specializes in talkin' trash
Carries himself like the world's biggest spender
But he ain't never got no cash
Clothes he wears are second to none
He's a Jack of all trades and a master of none
How are you doin'
Agrees with everything he knows nothin' about though, now
So he doesn't feel left out
Secondary all the things in life he really wants
Being in is his thing
So he's got to keep up his front

Tryin' to get over just anyway he can - can I tell you about it
Trvin' to get over just anyway he can
Can I tell you about it, can I tell you about it
Let me tell you about it
There, there, there
Da da da da da da

Well he's a self preservationist, yes he is
Let me hear you say yeah. yeah, yeah
And a super conversationist, yes he is
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, talk to the people

Always borrows, never lends
He says, you know me man, I was here, let me in
Says he's willing to stick through thick and thin
But when the chips are down
People find him if you can
Plastic man

Clain to fame he has none
Friends in this world, he has now maybe one
He hates being just another face in the crowd
Giving another brother, five and talk in' loud

Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
Tryin' to get over any way he can
Plastic man
