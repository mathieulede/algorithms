If I could only be sure that you love me baby
If I could only be sure that you love me darling
I'd climb the highest mountains, I'd swim the deepest sea
I'd take on all your misery to make you happy
I'd turn my world upside down
I'd turn my smile back into frowns
I'd do anything at all
If you'd only let me love you baby
Just to let me love you baby
If I could read your mind so you love me darling
If I could read your heart so you never leave me
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
I'd give my life for you baby, yes I would
I'd turn my world upside down
I'd turn my smile back into frowns
I'd do anything at all
If you'd only let me love you baby
Let me, let me love you baby
I'd turn my world upside down
I'd turn my smile all into frowns
I'd do anything at all
If you'd only let me love you baby
Just to let me, let me love you baby
Let me love you baby
Let me, let me love you baby
(Love you baby)
(Just to love you baby)
