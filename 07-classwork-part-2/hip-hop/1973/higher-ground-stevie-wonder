[Verse 1]
People keep on learning
Soldiers keep on warring
World keep on turning
Because it won't be too long

[Verse 2]
Powers keep on lying
While your people keep on dying
World keep on turning
Because it won't be too long

[Chorus]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
Until I reach my highest ground

[Verse 3]
Teachers keep on teaching
Preachers keep on preaching
World keep on turning
Because it won't be too long
Oh no

[Verse 4]
Lovers keep on loving
Believers keep on believing
Sleepers just stop sleeping
Because it won't be too long
Oh no

[Chorus]
I'm so glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Going to keep on trying
Until I reach my highest ground
No one's going to bring me down

[Outro]
Until I reach my highest ground
No one's going to bring me down
Oh no
Until I reach my highest ground
Don't let nobody bring you down (they'll sho 'nuff try)
