[Intro]
Darling, these last few days
Have been almost unbearable
I mean, nothing is going right
Since you’ve been gone

Nothing to do
No place to go
Nothing good comes
On the tv anymore
Since you’ve been gone
My whole world is
Just one big drag

Uh huh, baby
I’ve been missing you
Uh huh, baby
I’ve been missing you

Uh huh, baby
I’ve been missing you
Uh huh, baby
I’ve been missing you

I sit by my window
Just wanting you
To come back home
My days are nights
And my nights are days
Everything i do, child
Seems to turn out wrong

When you are here
It gives me too much joy
My heart is wrapped
Up in your love
Everytime you bring me joy
Oh, yeah, yeah

Uh huh, baby
I’ve been missing you
Uh huh, baby
I’ve been missing you
Uh huh, baby
I’ve been missing you

We shared our love
But now it’s gone
Like a stranger
In a big, old town
I feel so all alone

I’m believing
I love you so much
How would i ever do
Without your loving touch
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, i’ve been missing you
Uh huh, baby
I’ve been missing you
Uh huh, baby
I’ve been missing you
Uh huh, baby
I’ve been missing you…
