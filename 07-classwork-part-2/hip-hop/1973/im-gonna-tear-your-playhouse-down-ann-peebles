You think you've got it all set up
You think you've got the perfect plan
To charm everyone you see
And playing any game you can

But I've got news for you
I hope it don't hit you too hard
One of these days while you're at play
I'm gonna catch you off guard

I'm gonna tear your playhouse down pretty soon
I'm gonna tear your playhouse down room by room

You think love is just fun and games
Trying to be a playboy
All you do is run around
Using hearts as play toys

You've been playing daddy with every mama in town
What you gonna do when you look up one day
And see your playhouse tumbling down?

I'm gonna tear your playhouse down pretty soon
I'm gonna tear your playhouse down room by room

I'm gonna tear your playhouse down pretty soon
I'm gonna tear your playhouse down room by room
Yeah, yeah, pretty soon
I'm gonna tear your playhouse down room by room
