If the only sun shining for me now
Is over a mountain or around a hill
If all i ever needed in this lifetime of unfamiliar
Was freedom from a wishing well

If we could ride a storm for a thousand years
Hands picking cotton till we all remembered how to heal
No matter what the song says, no matter what the soul says
This time around we're gonna know exactly why we came here

This time around the days are changing like never before
This time around all the world may never know
What happens if we stop dreaming

He remembers stepping out the front door into a storm of rain
She remembers feeling empty chasing old memories of better days
As simple as the air we breathe coming in a little cleaner

Take a moment to sing for love to bring on a new season for this change

This time around
(Gonna watch the sun rise)
The days are changing
(Take a moment to sing for love)
Like never before

Move your soul to let more love in
Find the door is finally open
See the dawn of a new day breaking
This time around

Take a moment to sing for love
