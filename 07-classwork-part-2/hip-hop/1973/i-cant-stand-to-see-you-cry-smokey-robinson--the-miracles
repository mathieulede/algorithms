Your love is so precious and rare-iful
I realize that when you're not around

I've seen many guys
Taking advantage of you, love
They misuse your kindness
As a weakness too

No longer can I stand back
And watch your life fill with pain
I seen it too many times
Tryin' to smile and keep the tears?

[Chorus:]
I can't stand to see you cry
I love you too much
That's why
'Cause your love is so precious and rare-iful
Ohhhh...
I realize that you when you're not around

[End Chorus]
Oh, I share the pain
For the hurt
You have been through
I hate myself for silently?, now
Words that could've been your cure

So now I'd like to step right in
Please, confess your love of me
And my reward
For your faith
Will the be joy in your eyes, I see

'Cause baby

[Chorus]
Ohhhh, now, now, now, now...

I'm gonna be broke
Another life that's true, baby
Because that's how serious
I am in wanting you

So place your loving trust
In these hands of mine
And I'm gonna never?
And together happiness we'll find

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
I can't...
I can't...

[Chorus to fade]
