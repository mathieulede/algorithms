(Come and walk with me)
(We can go where peaceful waters flow)

If loneliness surrounds you
And rain clouds always hang around you
And wakin up each day gets you down (Gets you down, gets you down)
And if the life that youre leading
Seems hollow, then maybe what youre needing
Is someone to turn your world around

(Take my hand) Come take my hand and walk with me (And walk awhile)
(Let me teach you how to smile) Let me teach you how to smile
(And Ill show you skies ) And Ill show you skies where gentle breezes blow
(Where breezes, gentle breezes blow) Yeah, hey

And Ill take you where peaceful waters flow (Peaceful waters flow)
If you let me Ill take you where peaceful waters flow
(Come and walk with me) Mmm, hmm
(We can go where peaceful waters flow)

Now if the sunshine hurts your eyes, boy
Then its time for you to realize, boy
Beyond this moment theres
A better day (Better day), mmm, hmm (Better day)

And if you let me
Ill guide you, mmm
Ill always be there, right there beside you
Reaching every step of your way

(Come take my hand and walk) Come take my hand and walk with me awhile
(And walk awhile) Yeah, hey, hey
(Let me teach you how to smile ) Let me teach you how to smile
And Ill show you skies (Ill show you skies ) where gentle breezes blow
(Where breezes, gentle breezes blow) Hey, yeah, hey, hey, hey

And Ill take you where peaceful waters flow (Peaceful waters flow)
Hey, hey, if you trust me, Ill take you there where peaceful waters flow
(Come and walk with me) Mmm...hmm...
(We can go where peaceful waters flow)
