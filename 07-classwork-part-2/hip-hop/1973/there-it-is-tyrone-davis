Here I am with tears in my eyes
I can't help but to cry at
The sight just caught my eyes

I just got the surprise of my life
When I stumbled upon my wife
Smiling with another guy

Nobody could have made me
Believe what my own eyes had seen
Honey, but there it is, there it is

I followed them to a little old place
While they sit right down
And order taste

I couldn't believe that this was true
The girl sitting there could really be you
Oh, kissing, squeezing that other guy

Nobody could have told me that
That you would do this behind my back
Honey, but there it is, there it is

Oh, baby, baby, why you
Wanna treat me like this, baby

It hurt me so bad
The pain I just couldn't hide
The tears started falling
Down from my eyes

Here I stand with
My heart in my hand
I didn't know what to do
So I just turned and ran crying
Lonely, hurting inside
Now I'm all alone

Nobody could have told me that
That you would do this behind my back
Honey, but there it is, there it is

I'm hurting so bad
Honey, the pain, I just can't hide
Oowee, baby, I'm hurting inside
Why you gotta treat me like this, honey
