You ask me if
There'll come a time when I grow tired of you
Never, my love
Never, my love
You say you fear
I'll change my mind
And lose my desire
Never, my love
Never, my love
What makes you think that love will end
When you know that my whole life
Depends on you?
You say you fear
I'll change my mind and lose my desire
Never!
Never, never, never, my love
Never
Never, never, never, never, never. Never, my love
Hey!
Mm!
Never
Never
Never, my love
What makes you think that love will end
When you know that my whole life depends on you?
You say you fear
I'll change my mind and lose my desire
Never, my love
Never, my love
You see, if you need somebody
To stick by my side...
Hey, baby, you can call on me
Cause I need you
Need you here by me
