Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

It's possible, my love, I could be wrong
And it's possible that the things I'll do take long
Like always being late and always breaking our date
You can't even concentrate and I don't want to make you wait

I don't want to make you wait
I don't want to make you wait

And it's possible, I could slow down and see
It's possible that love you will give to me
Is real, listen but still, I'm always doing you wrong
And you just tag along, gee, you must be strong

I don't want to make you wait
I don't want to make you wait

I said I'm always doing you wrong
And you just tag along
Gee, you must be strong
And I don't wanna do you wrong

I don't want to make you wait
I don't want to make you wait
I don't want to make you wait
I don't want to make you wait
I don't want to make you wait
