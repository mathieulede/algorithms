Jesse, come home there's a hole
In the bed where we slept
Now it's growing cold

Hey Jesse, your face in the place
Where we lay by the hearth
All apart it hangs on my heart

And I'm keeping the light on the stairs
No I'm not scared
I wait for you

Hey Jesse, it's lonely
Come home

Jesse, the floors and the boards
Recalling your steps
And I remember too

All the pictures are fading
They're shaded in gray
But I still set a place on the table at noon

And I'm leaving the light on the stairs
And I'm not scared
I wait for you

Hey Jesse, I'm lonely
Come home

Jesse the spread on the bed
It's like when you left
I kept it for you
All the blues and the greens
Have been recently cleaned
And it's seemingly new

Hey Jess, me and you
We'll swallow the light on the stair
We'll do up my hair
We'll sleep unaware

Hey Jesse, it's lonely
Come home
