A world of love is mine alone
A world of love no one has known
And yet they speak of such a place
Beyond the stars, through time and space

So this is paradise, truly paradise
I dared to dream of
My wildest fantasy could never bring to me
Such lips, so filled with love

Lost in your kiss, here I will stay
Til there's no night 'til there's no day
What greater gift could ever be?
A world of love you gave to me
You gave to me a world of love
