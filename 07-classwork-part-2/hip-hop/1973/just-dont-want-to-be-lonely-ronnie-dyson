Just Don't Want To Be Lonely
The Main Ingredient

I don't mind when you say that you're going away
I just don't wanna be lonely
And I don't care if you share only moments a day
I just don't wanna be lonely

Chorus
I'd rather be loved and needed; depended on to give a love I can't give
When you're gone, when you're gone, I just don't want to be lonely. I'd
Just rather be loved

I don't mind when the time sets the sun to the moon
I just don't wanna be lonely
Let the stairs find you there, at the end of the room
I just don't wanna be lonely

Chorus
