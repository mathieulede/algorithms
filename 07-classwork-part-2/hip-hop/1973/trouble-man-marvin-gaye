[Verse 1]
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it sugar, playing by the rules
I come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checking trouble, sure moving down the line
I come up hard, baby, but that's OK
Because Trouble Man don't get in my way

[Verse 2]
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
Going to keep moving, going to roll to town
I come up hard, come on, get down
There's only three things that's for sure:
Taxes, death and trouble

[Bridge]
This I know, baby, this I know, child
Yeah, let the sweat through you, baby
Got me singing, yeah, yeah, ooh

[Verse 3]
I come up hard, baby, I had to fight
Took him on madness with all my might
I come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over and then again
I come up hard, but that's OK
Because Trouble Man don't get in my way

[Verse 4]
I've heard some places and I've seen some faces
I've never had tensions, I give my directions
When people say; that's OK, they don't bother me
I'm ready to make it, don't care about the weather
Don't care about no trouble, got myself together
No laughing, no crying, protection's all around me

[Verse 5]
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
With the Trouble Man
Moving, going tight
I come up hard, come on, get down
There's only three things for sure:
Taxes, death and trouble

This I know, baby
This I know, baby
Hey now, let it sweat, baby

[Outro]
I come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby, playing by the rules
I've come of heart, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checking trouble, sure, hey, moving down the line
