I'll always love my mama
She's my favorite girl
I'll always love my mama
She brought me in this world

Sometimes I feel so bad
When I think of all the things I used to do
How Mama used to clean
Somebody else's house
Just to buy me a new pair of shoes

I never understood
How Mama made it through the week
When she never ever got a good night's sleep

Talking 'bout mama
She's one of a kind
Talking 'bout mama
You've got your yours
And I've got mine

Talking 'bout mama
Oh, hey, mama
Hey, mama
My heart belongs to you

I'll always love my mama
She's my favorite girl
You only get one
You only get one, yeah
I'll always love my mama
She brought me in this world

A mother's love is so special
It's something that can't you can't describe
It's the kind of love that stays with you
Until the day you die

She taught me little things
Like say hello and thank you, please
While scrubbing those floors
On her bended knees

Talking 'bout mama
She's one of a kind
Talking 'bout mama
You've got your yours
And I've got mine

Talking 'bout mama
Oh, hey, mama
Hey, mama
My heart belongs to you

I'll always love my mama
She's my favorite girl
I'll always love my mama
She brought me in this world

I'll always love my mama
I'll always love my mama
I'll always love my mama
I'll always love my mama

I'll always love my mama
I'll always love my mama
I'll always love my mama
I'll always love my mama
