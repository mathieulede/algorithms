If you need a strong hand
To guide you through the night
If you want someone who understands
Then things can't get uptight

If it means anything to you
To know that I care for you
Check it out (Check it out)
Oh, check it out (Check it out)

I understand complications
Can sometimes bring you down
A different situation
Doesn't always be around

And if it means anything to you
To know that I care for you
Check it out (Check it out)
Baby, check it out (Check it out)

Oh...you know my love is here to stay
And it will always be that way
Look at me (Come on and look my way)
Oh, look at me (My love is here to stay)

Oh...surely you must know
My love will always grow
Can't you see (Look into my eyes, girl)
Mmm, can't you see (Look into my eyes, girl)
Ooh, can't you see (Ain't a big surprise, girl)

There may not be a dreary day
For you to suffer through {No, no, no, no}
If you would let me lead the way
I'd give the world to you

And if it means anything to you
Hey
Check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Baby, check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Check out your mind (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)

Look into my eyes, girl {Look into my eyes}
Look into my eyes (Ain't a big surprise, girl)
Check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Mmm, check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Check out your mind (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Oh, check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)

Look into my eyes, girl {Look into my eyes}
Look into my eyes (Ain't a big surprise, girl)
Check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Check it out (Check it out, check it out, girl)
Check out your mind (Check it out, check it out, girl)
