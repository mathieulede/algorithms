You can make me talk so easy
Boy, you sure know how
To please me (ooh, yeah)

Don't you do it if you
Think you got to, no
Don't you do it if you
Think you ought to (ooh, yeah)

Oh, oh, oh
Do it in the name of love
If you really want me
That's reason enough

Do it in the name of love
Do it in the name of love

Ooh, Lord, mmm hmm
Got to, oh

Don't you know we go together
I swear it feels like forever, boy
(Ooh, yeah)

Don't be scared now
Don't you worry, oh, yeah
It's all right
There's no hurry, woo (ooh, yeah)

Oh, oh, oh
Do it in the name of love
If you really want me
That's reason enough

Do it in the name of love
Oh, do it in the name of love
