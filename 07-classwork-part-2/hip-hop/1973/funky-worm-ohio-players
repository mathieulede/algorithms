[Clarence]
Theres' a worm in the ground, yes there is
[Granny]

[Clarence]
He's six feet long
[Granny]
Six feet long
[Clarence]
He only comes around
[Granny] when he wants to get down
But when he comes out of his hole
He sounds something like this

[Granny]
Oh that's funky
Like nine cans of shaving powder, that's funky
Alright. Sing it again, Clarence
[Clarence]
And through all the land, yeah
[Granny]

[Clarence]
He plays in a band
[Granny]
Plays in a band
[Clarence]
Plays guitar without any hands
Pretty good, I might add
[Granny]
Yeah, when he grabs his guitar and starts to pluck
Everybody wants to get up and dance

[Granny]
Ah, get it baby
Don't, don't, don't
Don't fight the feeling. Don't fight it
Hey, don't stop now honey, get down
I'm his manager, heh heh
Gonna make a million dollars
I get it all, cause he can't spend it
There he goes
Goin' back in his hole, just the same way he came out
Do we get paid for this?
I just wanted to make sure. We do? OK
