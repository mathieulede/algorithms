Like a star, slipping out of place
Sliding from the sky, tumbling through space
When you touch my hand
I swear I feel like I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)
Seems like I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)

Like a wheel whirling, round and round
Rolling down a hill
(Rolling down a hill)
Spinning on the ground
Your kisses make my dizzy
In the head and I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)
Falling
(Falling, falling, falling)

Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you

I was a bird soaring, through the air
Flying fancy free, without a care
Until you clipped my wings
Now look at me oh, I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)
Yeah, falling
(Falling, falling, falling)

Oh here I go, down and down I go
I can't help myself girl you thrill me so
Yeah you blew my mind
And I know that I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)
Yes, I'm falling
(Falling, falling, falling)

Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you

Oh, down, down, down I go
(Falling)
Oh, down, down, down I go
(Falling)
Oh, down, down, down I go
(Falling)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
(Seems like, seems like)
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
Uh oh girl
I think that I have fell for you
