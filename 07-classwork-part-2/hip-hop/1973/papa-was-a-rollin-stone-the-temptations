[Verse 1]
It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
Cause that was the day, that my daddy died
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma just hung her head and said, son

[Hook]×2
Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died, all he left us was alone

[Verse 2]
Hey momma
Is it true what they say that papa never worked a day, in his life
And momma, some bad talk goin' round town
Sayin' that papa had three outside children
And another wife, and that ain't right
I heard them talking papa doing some store front preachin'
Talking about saving souls and all the time leechin'
Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord
Momma just hung her head and said

[Hook]×2

[Verse 3]
Hey momma
I heard papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me, is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow, steal
To pay his bills

Hey momma
Folks say papa never was much on thinking
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth
Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son

[Hook]×4
