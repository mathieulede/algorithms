I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories

Hey window pain do you remember
How sweet it used to be
When we were together everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's one sound that I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window
Cause he's not here with me

Alone with the pillow
Where his head used to lay
I know you've got some sweet memories
But like the window you ain't got nothin' to say

I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window
It just keeps on haunting me
Hey rain, get off my window
Cause he's not here with me
