One cup of rain
Won't come off again
It'll still get played
I bet'cha
One small mistake
Can't be all it takes
To make you run away
I won't let'cha

Don't let it end
'Til you let it begin
Love wasn't meant to go out comin' in
Don't let it end
'Til you let it begin

Hold on
Diamonds are rough
Just before they come
Then the price goes up
Forever

Ahhh, just before love
The going may get tough
But don't you give it up
You just stay put

Oh, don't let it end
'Til you let it begin
Love wasn't meant to go out comin' in
Don't let it end
'Til you let it begin
Oh, no-oo

Hey baby
(Don't give up)
Don't give up
(Don't give up on love)
Not now girl
It's just getting good

(CHORUS 3x)
(FADE)
