Ooooh ooooooooh eee ooooh ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh
We brothers gonna work it out
We brothers gonna work it out

Brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)
Brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)
Brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)
Brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)
Gonna get it now

Now don't give him no peace hun'
If you don't mean it in your heart
United we can get over
Yet we're still apart

Cause each man demands respect
And to get an equal share
And until you give it him that
There'll be no peace...

Brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)
Brother's gonna work it all out (brother's gonna work it out)

Ooooh! We must all join hands
We can march across this land in peace!
(Brother's gonna work it out)
No joy, where that brother's standing unduly too long

Instead of brother turning on sister
Sister turning on brother
Now how you gonna get it together
Being against one another?

Shoot ups, live ups, all high
Till your world is turned to stone
How you can you deal with the truth
When reality's all gone?

Brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)
Brother's gonna work it all out (brother's gonna work it out)

All brothers sing
Stop the pimps, the hustler and
The pusher man as fast you can
Open your ears and eyes to the fact
Of what's truly holding you back!

OoOoOoOoOoOoOoh
Brother needs your help
Now, can't you see?
Aw he's got to have it
Oh right on
Ohhhh yeah

Brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)
Brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)

I hope that you will so
All the answers to your problems you can find
Yet you stay locked behind defeat
Yet the key is in your mind
Brother to win your brother's trust
These five things you must
Stop you robbing, stealing, killing, cheating and lying

Brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)
Oh brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)
Brother's gonna work it out (brother's gonna work it out)
Brother's gonna work it all out (brother's gonna work it out)
Brother's gonna work it (brother's gonna work it out)
