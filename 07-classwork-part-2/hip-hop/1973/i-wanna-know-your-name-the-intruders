I wanna know your name
Ooh, you look so good
I wanna know your name
What's your name, baby
I'd love ya if I could
â€~Cause you're the kind of girl
That I adore
And you're the kind of girl
I've been looking for
Hey, where do you live
Where do you live, baby
I'd like to take you home
What do I have to give
What do I have to give
To call you on the phone
â€~Cause you're the kind of girl
That I adore
And you're the kind of girl
I've been looking for
Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Just tell me your name
Please tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Ain't never seen nothin' as sweet as you
(I wanna know your name)
Sitting there in that gray dress, pretty little thing
(I wanna know your name)
â€~Cause I never believed
In love at first sight
But now I know
That it's alright
Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Please tell me your name
What's your name
(I wanna know your name)
You look so good, you look so good
(I wanna know your name)
Girl, ain't never seen nothing like this in my life
(I wanna know your name)
You just look like something I could settle down with
Let me introduce myself, my name is Little Sonny
I drive a little red Volkswagen
I like to go horse back riding
I like all kind of sweets, cupcakes, currants and things like that
This is why I can't help from noticing you
Just a jazzy, jazzy ol' babe
Come on, can I have this dance
Something as groovy as this, we got to dance
Lord, have mercy
Am I holding you too tight?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, excuse me
Ain't gonna get too close
When are you going to tell me your name?
Please tell me your name
I'm just going to have to grab you
And hold you a little closer
â€~Cause, I just got to, Lord, have mercy
(I wanna know your name)
Girl, tell me your name
(I wanna know your name)
Just hold me, just squeeze me
(I wanna know your name)
Girl, tell me your name, you sweet little thing, you
(I wanna know your name)
I could love you, I could love you, I could love you
All night long, all night long, all night long
Listen, what about giving your phone number
And I call you one Saturday afternoon
Perhaps we can go in town, have a little bite to eat
And then maybe, go and take a movie
And afterwards, I'll just drop you at the, at the doorstep
And give you little kiss
Oh, I just, there's so many things
That we could do if you just tell me your name
I am not even married, are you married?
Girl, you gotta tell me, tell me, tell me your name
Just wait a minute, don't leave out the door
Don't leave me, don't leave me
Just tell, just tell girl
Just wait a minute
