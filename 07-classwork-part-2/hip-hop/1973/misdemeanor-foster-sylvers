Pick up on the fact
Take it in stride
Love and devotion
Don't confide
It's the tracks of lost emotion
Let it glide
It's gonna subside
She stole my heart
Loved her from the start

Whatcha gonna do
When I think I'm in love
And I catch my girl doin' me wrong
Too bad
It's just enough
To slip back in the start
Like when you get your first ticket
For illegal parking

But don't you know
It's no big deal
Take it slow
She's not for real
Let it go
Fine you know
Until she stole my heart
She stole his heart

But it's just a misdemeanor
You gotta get-a over it
Oh, he loved her from the start

Love tracks, setbacks
All can come back

Pick up on the fact
Take it in stride
Love and devotion
Don't confide
It's the tracks of lost emotion
Let it glide
It's gonna subside
She stole my heart
Oh, she stole his heart

But it's just a misdemeanor
You gotta get-a over it
Oh, he loved her from the start

Whatcha gonna do
When I get to the goal
And my friends aren't tellin' me
When I'm playin' the fool

Oh, he loved her from the start
You gotta get over it
Love tracks, set backs
All can come back
Oh, she stole his heart
