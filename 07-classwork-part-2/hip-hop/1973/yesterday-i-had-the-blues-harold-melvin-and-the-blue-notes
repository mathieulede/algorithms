Yesterday, yeah, I had the blues
I couldn't win
All I did was a loss

But now
I got everything
You made my poor heart sing
Cause I got you baby
Oh, yes I do

Yesterday, yesterday, I had to cry
(Yesterday I had to cry)
Oh lord
Things were so bad
I wanted to die

But now it's just a memory
You made my poor heart sing
I'm so glad I got you baby
Oh, yes I am

You filled you filled
You filled my heart
With so much dark
I can't tell, I can't tell
By the way you make
You make me feel

You said it
And I said it
Over and over and over and over again
This love has, has got to be, got to be for real

Yesterday, yesterday I had the blues
(Yesterday I had the blues)
I was so sad and alone of you

But now
I got everything
You made my poor heart sing
I'm so glad I got you baby
Oh yeah

You came inside of my heart
Yes you did
And started a spark
Of love burning so hot
Oh yeah

I wanta say
You said it
And I said it
Over and over and over and over again
This love has, has got to be, got to be for real

Yesterday, yesterday I had the blues
(Yesterday I had the blues)
Yesterday, yesterday I had the blues
(Yesterday I had the blues)
Didn't I?
Oh those those cloudy days are all over
(Yesterday I had the blues)
Yes they are
Hah, 'cause I found you baby
(Yesterday I had the blues)
Oh yeah
Yesterday, yesterday I had the blues
(Yesterday I had the blues)
But the blues I won't sing no more
Oh yeah
Yesterday I had the blues
(Yesterday I had the blues)
But all I got is your heart
I thanked God I thanked God for you
(Yesterday I had the blues)
You know why?
You don't get me
I'm a brand new man
(Yesterday I had the blues)
Yes, I am - oh Lord
I got a brand new walk
(Yesterday I had the blues)
Oh, yeah
I got brand new spark
