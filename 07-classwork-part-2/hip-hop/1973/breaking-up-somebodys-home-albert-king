Laying around home alone
On a rainy night like this
Starving for your love
Hungry for just one kiss
Every raindrop I hear
On my window pane yeah
Beats so loud and clear
Why does it tell your name?
I got nowhere to turn to
Tired of being alone
I feel like breaking up somebody's home
I know it's useless
Hanging on to you
When you belong to someone else
Can't control the feelin'
Cause after all I didn't make it myself

Last night I cried so hard
I believe I caught a chill
Can't control the vibration
My heart just won't stand still
Got nowhere to turn to
I'm tired of being alone
I feel like breaking up somebody's home

I know you hear me talkin'
I know it's useless
Hanging on to you
When you belong to someone else
Can't control the vibration
Cause after all I didn't make it myself
Got nowhere to turn to
I'm tired of being alone
I feel like breaking up somebody's home
