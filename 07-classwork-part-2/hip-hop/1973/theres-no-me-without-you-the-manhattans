Baby, you are my life
And without you I'm an empty shell

There's no house without a home
And there's no man who wants to be alone
There's no child without a dream
And there's no song without a meaning

That's how I know
There's no me without you
There's no me without you

There's no life without a plan
Every woman wants herself a good man
There's a heartaches without tears
And time just can't go by without the years

That's how I know
There's no me without you
There's no me without you

You know there's no stars without the night
Huh, and there's no wrong without a right
And there's no good without a bad
And when one man is happy , the other man is sad

Oh...oh...that's how I know
There's no me without you
There's no me without you
Oh...oh...yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

That's how I know (That's how I know, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
There's no me without you (My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my)
That's how I know (There's no house, there's no house without a home)
That's how I know (And there's no man, no man who wants to be alone)
