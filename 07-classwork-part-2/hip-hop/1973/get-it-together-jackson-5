You better get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Get up, get up, get up

Get up off your high horse girl
Think what you're doin', doin'
Get up off your high horse girl
Think what you're doin' doin'

(I'm spinnin' around)
I'm spinnin' around
On your merry-go-round
You got me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy

Get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Now, now baby

Get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Now, now baby

Get up off your high horse girl
Think what you're doin', doin'
Get up off your high horse girl
Think what you're doin' doin'

I can't stand all this confusion
All this shuckin' and jivin'
Keeps puttin' me down, down, down

Get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Now, now baby

Think girl, what you're doin'
Throwin' this heart of mine all away
Oh,think girl,you know I love ya
To keep a love like mine is hard this day

Get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Now, now baby
