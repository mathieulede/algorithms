Well, once I lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money, no, I didn't care
Takin' my friend John out for a mighty good time
Drinkin' that good gin, champagne and wine

Aww, soon as my money got low
Didn't have a friend, couldn't find no place to go
But if I get my hands on a dollar again
I think I'11 hold on to it until the eagle grins

Cause, I found out
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
Down and out

Oh, Yeah, Hmmm wait a miunte

Went in your pocket there's not one penny
Old man, and good friend
I'm tellin' ya to find out if
You haven't got any

But just let you get up on my feet again
Here they all come tellin you
All are your long-lost friends!

Nobody wants you when you're down and out
Let me tell you bout it
Nobody wants ya - Ahhhh, Mobody wants ya
When you're down and out
Down and out
Nobody wants ya'
Whooooaaa Oooh Ooooh!
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I don't mean to take up much of your time
But i thought I'd drop this line
(Talking:Noboby wants ya) Nobody wants ya
