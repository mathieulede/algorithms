Here I come
I'm coming for a taste of your love
Here I come, baby
Because I like what you do for me

Little by little, bit by bit
I'm falling in love all over again

Here I come
I'm coming for a taste of your love
Here I come now, baby
Just like I did before
And I'm coming back
'cause this time I'm sure

It takes two, to make it
And I know you can take it, again

Here I come
I'm back for a taste of your Love
Here I come
I'm coming back for you now

Guitar

What you've been
Just come down on me
You've got the lock, pretty baby
But I've got the key

Little by little, bit by bit
I'm falling in Love all over again

Here I come
I'm coming for a taste of your love
Here I come now baby
I'm back for a taste of your love

You know, I'm coming back for a taste of your love
You know, I've got to come back now baby
