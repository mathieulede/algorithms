The shame that I carry with me I hide so well that you can't see
Or so I think I thought I had you fooled
But look close enough and you'll see
The shame that I carry with me I hide so well that you can't see
Or so I think I thought I had you fooled
But look close enough and you'll see
You'll see it dragging behind me
And the truth is, I know you know

Don't want to know
Don't want to see
Don't want to think
Don't want to breathe
You're catching up with me
Now you've got me all figured out,man
But you're to late the damage is done

Now I accept the blame
Yet I feel no shame
Did what I did to scrape by
I'll take full blame because it bears no weight in my brain
Truth is, the guilty have no shame

Don't want to know
Don't want to see
Don't want to think
Don't want to breathe
You're catching up with me
Now you've got me all figured out, man
You just can't fucking stop it

There's no way you'll understand it 'till you face it
When you've faced situations I've faced,you'll see it my way
What's mine is mine and what's yours is fucking yours

I'll accept the blame and I'll feel no shame
Did what I did to scrape by
I'll take the blame because it bears no weight no heavy weight in my brain
Truth is, the guilty have no shame

Don't want to know
Don't want to see
Don't want to think
Don't want to breathe
You're catching up with me
Now you've got me all figured out,man
But you're to late the damage is done

Taking what's mine and not yours

Mine and not yours!
