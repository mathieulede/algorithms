[Verse 1]
There's not a street that you can walk
You got to watch just who you're talking to
They're out to get ya, can't turn your back on a smiling face
Next thing you know, there ain't no trace of you
And this I betcha, some people lose and some folks win
It's a matter of what they do

[Chorus]
Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot you down?
When the evil flies and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend
Don't ya think you should be there?
Are you man enough when the going's rough?
Is it in your heart to care?

[Verse 2]
There's no pretending it goes away
With every step that you take you pay your dues and I ain't lying
You got to struggle to see the light
How someone's looking to steal your right to choose
And that don't stop trying
It's like a jungle outside the door and it's keeping you so confused

[Chorus]
Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot you down?
When the evil flies and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?

[Bridge]
Gotta keep your eye on the passers-by, better watch your step
Because you never know where the knife would go
And they ain't missed yet
The strong survive, they stay alive, they always do
But nothin' they ever teach you is true

[Chorus]
Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
Are you gonna let 'em shoot you down?
When the evil flies, and your brother cries
Are you gonna be around?
Someone needs a friend, just around the bend
Don't ya think you should be there?
Are you man enough when the going gets rough?
Is it in your heart to care?
Are you man enough, big and bad enough?
(Are you big and bad enough?)
Are you gonna let 'em shoot ya down?
When the evil flies, brother cries
(And your brother sighs)
Are you gonna be around?
