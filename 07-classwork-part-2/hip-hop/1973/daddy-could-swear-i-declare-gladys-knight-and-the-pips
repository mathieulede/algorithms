Oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, oh my mercy

Ooh, how I remember daddy
He was strong and had
A built in tan yeah
And though he only stood
About a five feet seven
My daddy was a heck of a man
Yes he was, y'all

He loved us all and we knew it, yeah
Though he showed it in a very funny way
For most of the time
He was a-cussin' and fussin'
When he said what he had to say
Now, now, now

Daddy couldn't read
Daddy couldn't write
But one thing daddy sure could do right

He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all
Daddy could swear
I declare, have mercy

I still remember seein' him in the backyard
Just a-pickin' and a-paintin' away
Woo, woo, woo, woo

Ooh, my brothers and sisters
Still talk about how
Daddy lost his temper that day
You see, he built a picket fence
From the garage to the house

Well, Sam, tell me what I say
The same day the garbage man
Backed into the fence
And the whole darn thing gave way
You should have been there

Daddy couldn't read
Daddy couldn't write
One thing daddy sure could do right

He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all
Daddy could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes, he could, y'all

Tell 'em about
Tell about your daddy

My daddy was a bad mouth
Watch ya say watch your mouth
My daddy was a bad mouth
Watch ya say watch your mouth
My daddy was a bad mouth
Watch ya say watch your mouth
Oow

Daddy wasn't no scholar, no
No, he didn't have PHd
But in my eyes and down in my heart
My daddy means the world to me

He'll probably go out
(Talkin' about daddy)
Cursin', just a-fussin'
And a-bein' mad
But I hope the Good Lord will understand
That my daddy's is just bein' my dad
Now, now, now, now

Daddy couldn't read
Daddy couldn't write
But one thing daddy sure could do right

He could swear
Oh, Lord, I declare
Yes he could, y'all
Daddy could swear
I declare
