HEY YOU...get of my mountain
HEY YOU...get of my cloud
HEY YOU...get off my mountain

Your just trying too
Bring me down

And you laugh in my face
Make me feel like a clown
Baby I think I better put you in your place
That kind of action I don't need (that kind of action)
That kind of heartache I can't use (that kind of heartache)
And that kind of lovin I can do without
So go and play your games with someone new

HEY YOU...(hey you) get off my mountain
HEY YOU...(ooooooo) get off my cloud
HEY YOU...(hey you) get off my mountain

Your just trying too (repeat 2 times)

Bring me down

(Music)

Oh! That kind of action I don't need (that kind of action)
And that kind of heartache I can't use (that kind of heartache)
And that kind of lovin I can do without
So go and play your game with someone new

HEY YOU....(hey you) get off my mountain
HEY YOU....(hey you) get off my cloud
Stay off my cloud
HEY YOU... get off my mountain
Your just trying too (repeat 1 time)
I said your just trying too
Bring me down....
Just tryin, just trying (fade out)
