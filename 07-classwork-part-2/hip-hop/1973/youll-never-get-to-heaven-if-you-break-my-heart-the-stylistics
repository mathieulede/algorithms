Mother told me always to follow the golden rule
And she said it's really a sin to be mean and cruel
So remember if you're untrue
Angels up in heaven are looking at you

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart
So be very careful not to make us part
You won't get to heaven if you break my heart
Oh no!

I've been hearin' rumors about how you play around
Though I don't believe what I hear, still it gets me down
If you ever should say goodbye
It would be so awful the angels would cry

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart
So be very careful not to make us part
You won't get to heaven if you break my heart
Oh no!

(If you break my heart, break my heart)

I can hardly wait for the day when we say I do
It's a day I dreamed of so long now it's comin' true
You will promise to cherish me
If you break your promise the angels will see

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart
So be very careful not to make us part
You won't get to heaven if you break my heart
Oh . .
