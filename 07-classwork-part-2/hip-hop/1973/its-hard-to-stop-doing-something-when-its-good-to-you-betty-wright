It's hard to stop doing something
That's good to you, yeah, yeah
It's hard to stop doing something
That's good to you

It's hard to stop doing something
That's sweet to you, ooh
It's hard to stop doing something
That's good to you

I love a man
Who never stays at home, no
He's always out on the street
And all of my friends say
I should leave him alone

Now he won't work, this man is lazy
Oh, but at night, when I'm in in arms
His loving drives me crazy
That's why I have to tell my friends

It's hard to stop doing something
That's good to you, ooh
It's hard to stop doing something
That's good to you, yes, it is

It's hard to stop loving
When the loving is good to you
Don't you know, it's hard to stop
Kissing when the kissing
Gets good to you, yeah

We go out together
But he leaves me by myself
Yeah, all by myself
And all night
He's with somebody else

Now sometimes I feel
That I should make a plan, yeah
But I can't let him go
'Cause he's a good looking man

That's why I don't mind testifying

It's hard to stop doing something
That's good to you
It's hard to stop loving
When the loving is good to you

Oh, ho, it's hard to stop
Hard to stop, yes, it is
