[Verse 1]
Are you out to speculate
Come here to date and to find a mate
Two hearts a scientific find
Searching for love for a very long time
So I got my eyes on you
Take time to know me if [?]
Show me [?]
I need much more than a one night lover

[Chorus]
Two hearts that feel like one
It's scientific love
(Ooh show me baby - Scientific)
You and me having fun
It's scientific love

[Verse 2]
We are more than right to be
Finally keeping the company
Can't stop this chemical reaction
Better if we make it everlasting

[Bridge]
So you don't wanna be alone
You'd better walk into my heart right now ooh
And yeah you wanna be free yeah
Well I'm telling you
Scientifically

Two hearts that feel like one
