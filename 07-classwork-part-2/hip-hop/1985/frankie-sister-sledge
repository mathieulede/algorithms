Hey Frankie?!
I was walking down the street one day

When I looked up I saw a friend
Hey Frankie - do you remember me?

He looked at me and then I blushed
'Cause I remembered I loved you so much
Way back then we were friends going together
But then you left me
Frankie - do you remember me? Frankie - do you remember?

You were fifteen
I was twelve
It was summer
We were so in love
I never loved anyone this much
Look at me
I'm thrilled to your touch
Hey Frankie - do you remember me?
Frankie - do you remember me?

Oh how you brought me down - down down
All I did was runnin' around - around
You'll never know how much I loved you

Frankie - do you remember? Do you remember me? Frankie -
You walked me to the Deli
Then we sat in the booth where it all began
I looked into your big eyes
And I said to myself we coulda have twins
Hey Frankie - do you remember me?
Oh how you brought me down - down down...

He looked at me and then I blushed ...
Frankie - do you remember me? Do you remember me?
Frankie
My Frankie
My baby
Frankie - do you remember me?
Frankie - do you remember me? Frankie -
