Ooooh baby
Gotta get you home with me tonight

Gotta hold you body tight
Make you scream and shout all night
I'll do those things
That are good... to you lady..
I've got the tools. i'm sure you gonna like...

So kick off you shoes
And lay back and let me soothe you
I'm in No rush
I'll take my time..

To get us in the mood
And an atmosphere
That's sure to please you..
