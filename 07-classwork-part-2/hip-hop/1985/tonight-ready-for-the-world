It's getting late, while are you still here, girl
Have you made up your mind, you wanna make love tonight
I want you to hold me, I want to be for real, girl
Please tonight
Don't want you to go â€~cause I don't feel like bein' lonely, no
Not tonight, honey, not tonight
You're so scared â€~cause I can feel your heartbeat
It's so fast
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, tonight
You're probably thinking you're gonna be a woman
After all of this
Let me tell you, you're more woman than I ever seen
Girl, tonight
I want your lips, I even want your tongue, love
Come, give it to me, come, give it to me
Take your time, but don't you take too long, girl
Please tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, tonight
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh
Tonight
You're so wet, you can barely wait, girl
But see it's alright, honey, it's alright
It's so dark, but I don't even care, girl
I know where to go, I know what to do
You're the heart and I am the arrow, girl
Let me shoot you, uh
Don't you worry â€~bout a damn thing, girl, no
