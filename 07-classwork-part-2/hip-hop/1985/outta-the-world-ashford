Hands are tender, want so much
I surrender to your touch
Paralyzed by them eyes
I don't know, boy

Feel like something
Outta the world
Feel it, feel it
Outta the world
Got to feel it
Outta the world
Feel it, feel it
Outta the world
Feel it, feel it
Outta the world

My intuition does no good
I keep a wishing
I understood what it is
Holds me captive
I don't know, boy

Feelis like something
Outta the world
Feel it, feel it
Outta the world
Feel it, feel it
Outta the world
Feel it, feel it
Outta the world

My body and mind in a transformation
No way to resist the temptation

Something outta the world
Feel it, feel it
Outta the world
Feel it, feel it
Outta the world
Outta the world
