[Verse 1]
Diamond life lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
Sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

[Hook]
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

[Bridge]
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago: Western male
Across the North and South, to Key Largo: love for sale

[Verse 2]
Face-to-face, each a classic case
We shadow box and double-cross
Yet need the chase
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels'; his heart is cold

[Hook]
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

[Bridge]
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago: Western male
Across the North and South, to Key Largo: love for sale

[Outro:]
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
