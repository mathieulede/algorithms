You look good to me
You look good to me

[Verse 1:]
Oh, I found him 'bout a week ago
My friends were going out
They said, you rarely go
That's how I got him to
Really knock me dead
Looked him in the eyes and quickly said

[Chorus:]
You look good to me
When you walk
I just lose all my control

You look good to me
And when you talk
I just want to kiss your big mouth, baby

[Verse 2:]
I want you to know you look good to me
So I [?] you, baby
Uh, baby, uh, baby

Never ever been a forward girl
I just speak my mind
Being honest never felt so good
Or looked so fine

Looking good isn't everything
And personality won't make emotion a thing
The combination is what love's about
I'm not in love
But I have no doubt

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Wait a minute
Hey, girls
Yeah
Are there any good looking men out there?
Yeah

Hello, men
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ha, well
If you think you're fine
Then try to sing along with my mind

Na na na, na na na, na na
Na na na, na na na, na na
Na, na, na, na na
Na, na, na, na na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
You sound as good as you look

[Chorus:]
You look good to me
You look good to me
You look good to me

You look good to me
You look good to me
You look good to me
You look good to me
Somebody wanna dance with me?

Never been a forward girl
I just speak my mind
Being honest never felt so good
Or looked so fine

Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh, uh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, sing it
Na, na na, na, na na
Na na, na na na, na na, na na na
Na na, na na

Ha ha
That was good
Now repeat after me

You look good to me
You look good to me

You look good to me
You look good to me
You look good to me

You look good to me
You look good to me
You look good to me

You look good to me
You look good to me
You look good to me

You look good to me
You look good to me
You look good to me

You look good to me
You look good to me
You look good to me
