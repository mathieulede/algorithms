With you I find that love is forever
The more I give to thee, the more I have to give
So, take it
(take it)
I like to do things for myself
I never waste and never want
I guess I'm that way with my love
I've never died a broken heart
But there was something in your eyes
That make long for tender times
(tender times)
A temporary loss to passions design
And in moment your love was mine

I was all alone and love was overdue
(hard for me, baby)
Now there is a part of me that i want to give to you
Over and over

Chorus
This is for you
(it's the most i can do)
And i want to give it too you girl
Its a part of me
(it's the very heart of me)
For you to, always keep
And always keep this love
This is for you

I'll face the truth about myself
I've never trusted anyone
To give as much love in return
At least until, you came along
But there was something in your smile
That made me long for tender times
(tender times)
A temporary lost to passion design
And in a moment your love was mine

I was all alone and love was overdue
(hard for, baby)

Now there is a part of me that i want to give to you
Over and over

Chorus
This is for you
It's the most i can do
And i want to give it too you girl
Its a part of me
It's the very heart of me
For you to, always keep
It's yours to keep baby
This is for you
It's the most i can do
It's a part of me
For you to always keep
Baby, always keep this love

Now there's apart of me that i want too give to you
Over and over

Chorus
This is for you
Its the most I can do
Its the most I can do girl
It's a part of me
Wanna give it over and over again
For you to alwats keep
Yeah yeah

This is for you
Its the most I can do
Baby, when im touching you
Holding you
Squeezing you, baby, I can't get enough no no
For you...............

This is for you girl
Always keep this love
