Take me home, Take me home

Baby, I know you're wondering
Why I won't go over to your place
Cause I'm not to sure about how you feel
So I'd rather go at my own pace
And I know and you know that if we get together
Emotions will go to work
And I may do something I might regret the next day
And end up hurt
Oh I don't know...

That's the way that I feel
I'm so afraid of a one night deal
I wonder if I take you home would you still make me love baby
Because I need you tonight
I wonder if i take you home would you still make me love baby
Because i need you tonight

Your love is... take me home

Lately you've been expressing to me
Just how much you want to make love
I want it just as much as you do
But will you still keep in touch
You say I'm teasing but ought to have a reason
Don't let your feelings fade
Cause you will have me and sooner than you know it
If you could only wait
Oh I dont know...

Thats the way i feel
Im so afraid of a one night deal, cuz sometimes
I wonder if i take you home, will you still make me love baby
Because i need you tonight
I wonder if i take you home will you still make me love baby
(home home, home home)
Because i need you tonight
I wonder if i take you home will you still make me love baby
Because i need you tonight
I wonder if i take you home will you still make me love baby
(home home, home home)
Because i need you tonight

And on the real side, if you love me (huhh)
You would wait

I wonder if i take you home, (home home, home home)
I wonder if i take you home

Your love is...

I wonder if take you home, would you still make me love baby
Because i need you tonight
I wonder if take you home, would you still make me love baby
Because i need you tonight

I wonder, I wonder, I really really wonder (home home, home home)
Take me home
I wonder, I wonder, I really really wonder
Take me home

Your love is...
No Good!

Keep telling me lies & ur still not sure
-in my eyes, our relationship would be more clear
"no its just i feel that your rushing me"
"ok, since you dont love me & dont want to be with me"
"no its not that its just that im afraid of getting hurt"
I dont know i just keep asking myself, Should i really take you home?
What do you think?

Take me, take me
Take me home
Take me, take me
Take me home
Take me, take me
Take me home
Home home, home home

Home
Your down on your knees
Begging me please

Take me home
TAKE ME HOME!

Will you still love me
IF I TAKE YOU HOME!
Will you still love me
IF I TAKE YOU HOME!!!!
