[Intro:]
I know I was looking good
I had my Kenneth Cole shoes on
My Gianni Versace blue leather suit

My nails were done
And my hair was fierce
And I was riding in a Cooper's limousine
Don't you want to ride?

[Verse 1:]
I was at home feeling sleazy
So I went down to the speakeasy
As soon as my feet hit the door
I had all attention from the dance floor

[Chorus:]
Don't you know the men all pause?
When I walked into the room
The men all pause

The men all pause
When I walked into the room
The men all pause
And the brides held their grooms

And they all sang the same old tune
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Check me out
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2:]
Staring faces starting to get tired
I wanted to get out
And go for a ride
Maybe this boredom created my hunger
So I said, "Pull over at the local fat burger"

I tried to walk in shy
Very unnoticed
But the men turned away
From their burgers and sodas

The focus was on me
I guess admiring good taste
I tried to play it off
But assurance was all over my face

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
The men all pause
When I hit the door
Attention came from the dance floor
When I went to the burger stand
I had my claim on any man

Slap me, no
Somebody slap me
'Cause I know I'm looking good

I'm giving attitude all over the room
People are staring at me
And I just look too good
For these people

Don't you know the men all pause?
Yeah, just look at them
(Woof)

The dog is coming out of them
A natural dog Radar
(Woof)
Radar, kitty girl

I think I'm gonna leave right now
Because I have some things to do
Call my chauffeur
I love you
I love you all, but I got to go

Oh, turn me on
The men all pause
The men all pause
The men all pause
The men all pause

[Repeat Chorus:]
