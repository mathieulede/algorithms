(Ah)
(Ah)
(Tonight)

I'm putting on my makeup
It's time to wake up
The owners of the night are calling me

I'm ready and I'm willing
To pull out the happy feeling
Something special's in the air for me

The night is mine
I'm gonna keep it just right
An angel in my pocket, right?

It feels so right
This mirror's telling no lie
I'm gonna let this magic shine (Shine, shi-ine, oho!)

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine

I feel like winning
I don't know the reason
Something telling me to let it ride

Got me rockin' and reeling
I don't know what the deal is
Something special I just can't describe

The night is mine
I'm gonna keep it just right
On my way to paradise

It feels so fine
It feels just like the first time
I'm going all the way this time (Time, time, ti-ime!)

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine

This is my night

This is my night
This is my night
Let it shine

This is my night
This is my night
This is my, my, my, my, my night
My, my, my night

It feels so right
This mirror's tellin' no lie
I'm gonna let this magic shine
Let it shine, let it shine

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (Let it shine)

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (Let it shine)

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (Shine!)

My night

Shine!

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (Let it shine)

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (Shine)

This is my night (Tonight)
I'm gonna do it just right
I'm gonna let this magic shine (Let it shine)
