Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop
Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop

There's something in the air
It's telling me I should beware
Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop
These multi city streets
Make it so that you can't miss a beat
Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop
I've got to keep my two eyes open today
Look out for someone that might have the urge to play
Maybe go to California with a suitcase in my hand
Get me a suite in Beverly Hills and have
The best of life and thrills

I can't stop
No I just can't stop it now
I can't stop
Got to keep on rocking and living it up
Ain't never gonna give up
I can't stop
No I just can't stop it now
I can't stop
Got to keep on rocking and living it up
Ain't never gonna give up

I can't stop babe

There's something in the air
It's telling me I should beware
Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop
These multi city streets
Make it so that you can't miss a beat
Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop, Can't Stop
I've got to keep my two eyes open today
Look out for someone that might have the urge to play
Maybe go to California with a suitcase in my hand
Get me a suite in Beverly Hills and have
The best of life and thrills

I can't stop
No I just can't stop it now
I can't stop
Got to keep on rocking and living it up
Ain't never gonna give up
I can't stop
No I just can't stop it now
I can't stop
Got to keep on rocking and living it up
Ain't never gonna give up

I can't stop, I can't stop
