[Verse 1]
What's the matter with your life
Is the poverty bringing you down?
Is the mailman jerking you around?
Did he put your million dollar check
In someone else's box?

Tell me, what's the matter with your world
Was it a boy when you wanted a girl? (Boy when you wanted a girl)
Don't you know straight hair has got no curl (No curl)
Life it isn't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

[Chorus]
Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space to fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life it isn't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

[Verse 2]
Tell me, what's that underneath your hair?
Is there anybody living there? (Anybody living there)
You can't get over, if you say you just don't care (Don't care)
Show me a boy who stays in school
And I'll show you a boy aware!
Dig it

[Chorus]
Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space to fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life it isn't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

[Verse 3]
What are you putting in your nose?
Is that where all your money goes? (Is that where your money goes?)
The river of addiction flows
You think it's hot, but there won't be any water
When the fire blows
Dig it

[Chorus]
Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space to fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life it isn't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it

[Chorus]
Pop life
Everybody needs a thrill
Pop life
We all got a space to fill
Pop life
Everybody can't be on top
But life it isn't real funky
Unless it's got that pop
Dig it
