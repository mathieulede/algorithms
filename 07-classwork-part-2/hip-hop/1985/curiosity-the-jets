[Chorus:]
Curiosity
I've got to know
Is she just a play thing?

Curiosity
I wanna know
Baby, can I pull your string?

[Verse 1:]
At every dance
She is on your arm
You even let her drive your car

She wears your ring
You treat her oh so fine
But you're telling me
That I'm the one thats on your mind

When she took a walk to the ladies room
You didn't hesistate to run to me
I don't wanna be caught in the middle of you
But your charm keeps getting the best of me

[Repeat Chorus:]

Curiosity
Curiosity

[Verse 2:]
When you get home
Out of the socialite
You call me with the same excuse

I get upset
But you talk so smooth
Got me running round in circles
Feeling so confused

One thing that
I've learned is
To be careful
What you're wishing for

'Cause what you receive
Isn't always what you need
But you are the star in all my dreams

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Bridge x2:]
Baby
I don't wanna be just a play thing
Baby
I've got to have it all

[Repeat Chorus:]
