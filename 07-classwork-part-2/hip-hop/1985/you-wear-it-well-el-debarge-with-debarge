On the streets
And everywhere
You're turning heads
You've got that laissez faire

You just smile, yeah
And walk on through, oh, oh
You've got that personality, babe
And it sure looks good on you, yeah

Not the ordinary, anything you wear
Looks good on you especially
Nothing I can tell you haven't
Already heard a half a million times
But I'd still like to say

You wear it well
You wear it well, you wear it well, oh
You wear it well
You wear it well, you wear it well

There they go
They look so lovely too
But even so
They can't compete with you, no

You've got class
You're more than just
A pretty face, no, no, babe
You've got that personality, babe
You've got exactly what it takes
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Not the ordinary, anything you wear
Looks good on you especially
Nothing I can tell you haven't
Already heard a half a million times
But I'd still like to say

You wear it well (ooh, sure nuff)
You wear it well, you wear it well (woo)
You wear it well (oh, yeah, baby)
You wear it well, you wear it well
(You take my breath away)

You wear it well (ooh, sure nuff)
You wear it well, you wear it well
(Ah, yeah, baby) you wear it well
You wear it well, you wear it well

Wear

You wear it well, you wear it well
Just wanna tell you, you wear it well
The way it looks on you, you wear it well
Just wanna tell you, you wear it well

You wear it well
You wear it well, you wear it well
(Go on with your bad self)
You wear it well (ho)
You wear it well, you wear it well
(You take my breath away)

You wear it
