Here I am
And I want you to see, baby
I wanna watch you watchin' me in motion
To taste the secret side of me

Every time I look at you, I know
You're fighting your emotions
Now you have no choice but to let go
And dive into my ocean

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet, yeah

Hold my hand
I'm gonna set you free, baby
I'm gonna let you fly all over me
Show me a lock and I'll show you the key

Every time you feel like holdin' back
I'm gonna pull you deeper
Always steerin' from the beaten track
And I will be the reaper

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Oh, honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet, yeah

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Oh, honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet, yeah

Honey (Honey) {Honey}
Honey for the bees
Honey for the bees
Honey for the bees
Honey for the bees
Honey for the bees

Sugar (Sugar)
Sugar (Sugar)
Sugar (Sugar)
Sugar (Sugar)

Every time I look at you, I know
You're fighting your emotions
Now you have no choice but to let go
And dive into my ocean

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet, yeah

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet, yeah

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet, yeah

Honey for the bees
Sugar never was so sweet
Oh, honey for the bees
