Say I'm your number one
I only wanna be close to you - say

Say I'm your number one - your number one
Your number one -
'cause you know I'll be good to you - say
Say
Say
Say I'm your number one - won't you ?

They say I'm crazy
They say that I'm a fool
And I feel so helpless because love can be so cruel
But I'm just waiting and burning up inside
Come tomorrow
Come tomorrow
Will you still be mine ?

Say I'm your number one - your number on
Your number one -
In only wanna be close to you
Say I'm your number one - your number one
Your number one
'Cause you know I'll be good to you - say
Say
Say

Say I'm your number one - won't you
You may be tempted and sometimes led astray
But I know
But I know your regret it very next day
I sit and wonder whenever we're apart

Would you do it
Would you do it
Would you go and break my heart ?

Say I'm your number one - your number on
Your number one -
In only wanna be close to you
Say I'm your number one - your number one
Your number one
'Cause you know I'll be good to you - say
Say

Tell me that nobody else will do -
