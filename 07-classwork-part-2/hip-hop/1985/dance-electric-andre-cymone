[Intro]
Good morning children
Take a look out your window
Our world is falling
It's almost time to go
(Dance)
Dance the Dance Electric
The rhythm is love and love is blind
Love your enemies
There isn't much time, there isn't much time

[Verse 1]
Look - our world is falling
A rhythmless house of blinded prophecy
Hear our Master calling
This isn't what He wanted us to be

[Chorus]
We got to dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

[Verse 2]
Don't - it don't make you happy
To give another someone your own smile
Dance the dance electric
Never mind your hatred, try a brand new style

[Chorus]
Dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

We... love... all... enemies

[Verse 3]
Look - you're livin' in Babylon
Makin', but not feelin' love at all
When your youth is gone, when it comes to dawn
A light of truth will shine and you will fall

[Chorus]
That's why you got to dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go

[Verse 4]
See the light inside of us
You're stuck in living, livin' life as bad
Whatever you do, don't you let your life go without my love
It's the only life that you will ever have

[Chorus]
Why don't you dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go
(almost time to)
Dance the Dance Electric
Listen to the rhythm of your soul
Come on and dance the Dance Electric
We better love each other, it's almost time to go
