All my friends say he's much too hot
Don't get involved, it's emotional shock
But, ooh, he charges my electricity
When he puts his finger on me
I said a oh, oh, oh, you know I want you
And I, and I, and I need you, pretty baby
I'm in the fire, there's just no turning back
Though I know, know, know, whoa-whoa-whoa...

You're dangerous
(Ooh...)
So hot and heavy, I know that I just can't resist
Ooh, dangerous
I feel my heart beat, I feel it beating faster
Ooh, ooh, too dangerous
(Ooh...)
The way you kiss me, I know I never felt like this
Oh, you're dangerous
Wild even stranger, need a little danger

Hoo, ooh...

Ooh, you make your move and I'm begging please
Then you're pushing me away, you know you're such a tease
One look can drive me right out of my mind
And get my heart pumping double time
And then I hear myself say you better be strong
Stay away; he's gonna do wrong
You better run, girl, while you've got the chance
'Cause you know, know, know, whoa-whoa-whoa

He's dangerous
(Ooh...)
So hot and heavy, I know that I just can't resist
Ooh dangerous
I feel my heart beat, I feel it beating faster
Ooh, ooh, too dangerous
(Ooh...)
The way you kiss me, I never, ever felt like this
Oh, you're dangerous
Wild even stranger, need a little of your love

Your love, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh

I'm in too deep and when you're close to me
I get so weak
Our bodies touch and then our hearts collide
I feel inside, emotional love exploding

Oh, dangerous
(Ooh...)
So hot and heavy I know that I just can't resist (this)
Ooh, dangerous
I feel my heart beat, beating a little bit faster
Ooh, ooh too dangerous
(Ooh...)
The way you kiss me, I never, ever felt like this (this)
(Oh, you're dangerous)
Wild even stranger, need a little danger
