I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good

Flash, we meet
Passin' in the streets
Words unspoken
Silence unbroken, hey

Just by chance
We fell into romance
The cry of success
Left no room to guess

Oh, no (Oh, no)
Love has knocked us down and scored
We've been twice around the block before
Know the changes you've been through
My promise is to you

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I fell in love so quick
I knew that this was it
So much emotion
Made so much devotion

And when we talk
We're never miles apart
Your telephone line
Is tied right to my heart

(Love me, baby)
Your love has knocked me down and scored
(Knock me out, baby)
You may hide and close your door
(Baby, baby)
Open up, I swear it's true
(What you gonna do)

I'll be good {I just wanna be good}
To you (How good)
Better than before (Mmm...)
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good
Will you be good, boy
{So good}, so good {Hey}
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

When we talk
We're never miles apart
Telephone line (Telephone line)
Tied straight to my heart

I fell in love so quick
I thought my mind was playin' tricks
One twist of fate
Made it somethin' so great

Let me show you how to live
Stop goin' from town to town
Don't be afraid to give
Time to settle down

When I'm good I'm bad
And when I'm bad I'm better
When I'm at my best
There's no room to guess

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Mmm... ooh

I'll be good
Better than before
Know I'll love you more
Better than before
You know I'll love you more

I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
I'll be good, good, good, good
