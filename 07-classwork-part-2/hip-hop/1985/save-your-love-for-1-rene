Save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That you gotta come home to
You got to save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That's always there
To hold you

You got to save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That you gotta come home to
You got to save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That's always there
To hold you

I work hard all day
For a little play at night
My body aches
Come and make it alright

When I called you hot
On the telephone
My heartbeat stopped
'Cause you were not at home

(Save your love)
Sa-save your love
(For your number one)
(Save your love)
Sa-save your love
(For your number one)

Rumor has it
Girl
I've been dippin' and dabbin'
My friends are blabbin'
About some girl
I've been havin'

I'm good with you
'Cause you know what to do, baby
When all is said and done
You're still my only one

(Save your love)
Sa-save your love
(Save your love)
(For your number one)
(Save your love, baby)
(Save your love)
Sa-save your love
(For your number one)

Ooh, I'm the one
That you have to come home to
I'm the one
That will always love you

I'm the one
Keepin' things together
I'm the one
Who'll last
Through stormy weather

Save your love
Ooh

Save your love
For your number one
Save your love
For your number one

Save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That you gotta come home to
You got to save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That's always there
To hold you, hit it
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha, ha-ha, ooh
Huh-ho, ruff
Yeah, baby
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

Save some love
For your number one

I work so hard
Every day on time
When I come home
I want some peace of mind
Got to fight them
Don't want to fight you
That's why I tell you
That my love is true
'Cause my love is strong
Just like my big heart
And I don't want nobody
To tear it apart
'Cause you are the dream
That I have seeked
And that's why I'm rappin'
To the funky beat
Just to let you know
That you're my number one
From now until
Until the day I'm done

Save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That you gotta come home to
You got to save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That's always there
To hold you

You got to save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That you gotta come home to
You got to save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That's always there
To hold you

You got to save your love
Save your love
Sa-save your love
Save-save your love
Save your love
For number one, y'all
For the one
That you gotta come home to
