Voice: Get out!

It's over now

Something's going on
It's the middle of the night
And my ESP woke me up
I know what's going on girl
You ain't been treating me right
And your sweet talking ain't enough
I know you're messing
With at least 2 other guys
You fooled me a long time
But the kid is getting wise
Yes I am

Don't hug me
Don't kiss me
Don't love me down
Excuse me, but you see
This love affair is over now

You did me bad
(Over now)
It's over now
You treated me so bad
(Over now)
It's all over baby

I didn't know it when I walked into the house
But you were on the telephone
That's when I heard you tell him
To come over tonight
Said you were gonna be alone
I heard you mention
That I had someplace to go
And you helped me pack my things
But it's you who's got to go
Yes it is

You're busted
You must have fooled me for a while
But honey, as they say
Hit the road
It's all over now
You did me bad
(Over now)
It's over now
You treated me so bad
(Over now)
It's all over baby

You can go now
Keep your voice down
There's no need to fuss and shout
Use the backdoor
I don't want no nosy neighbors to see you
Check it out

Voice: Get out

(It's all over baby)

Bye baby (bye baby)
So long (so long)
It's been a while
If you really love me
I wouldn't say it's over now
But you did me bad
(Over now)
It's over now
Well, well
You treated me so bad
(Over now)
It's all over baby
Over now
Over baby
It's surely over now
(Over now)
It's all over baby
It's over now
It's all over baby
It's all over now
(Over now)
It's all over baby
(It's all over baby)

It's over now
