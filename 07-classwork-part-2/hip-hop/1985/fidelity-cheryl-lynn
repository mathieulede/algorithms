No, no, no, hold it, baby
Hold it right there
Now that’s not the groove we used to groove with
Now I know you haven’t gotten out there and gotten totally tired
Come on, baby, do it the way we used to…OWW!
That’s it
Ah yeah

[Chorus]
Me for you
You for me
Fidelity (Oh, my baby)
Only two, never three
Fidelity

[Verse 1]
Think about the times (Are you thinkin’?)
The time you said you only would be mine
(But you lied)
Counting to three is too high for me…ooh

[Chorus]
Me for you
You for me
Fidelity
Only two (only two), never three (never three)
Fidelity

[Verse 2]
Don’t care what other people do
(No, no, no, no, no…and you know why)
‘Cause other people don’t have to sleep with you
But I do (I do)
So offer me a guarantee

[Chorus]
Me for you (Me for you)
You for me (You for me)
Fidelity
(Oh, I’m talking ‘bout fidelity, yeah)
Only two (only two), never three (never three)
Fidelity
(Oh, my baby, baby, baby, baby)

Me for you
You for me (You for me)
Fidelity
Only two (only two), never three (never three)
Fidelity

Hmm, you can leave home anytime that you want
But don’t you bring home nothin’ you didn’t leave here with
Yeah, I meant what I said, and I said what I meant
Or in other words, baby
I got my first come, fool around
Stick it if you please, but know that you lost me
‘Cause I would rather lose you
Than take the chance of catching somebody’s D-I-S-E-A-S-E
And I’m not talking about the flu
There’s no need to shop around, baby
‘Cause you know you get more here

[Chorus]
Me for you
You for me
Fidelity
Only two, never three
Fidelity
(That’s you and me)

Me for you
You for me
Fidelity
Only two, never three

Now did you learn that in school, baby?
I’m good, you’ll see
Better than you thought I would be
Know why?
No lie
I’m focusing my love on one guy

Oh, I’m talking ‘bout fidelity

[Chorus]
Me for you
You for me
Fidelity (Oh, yeah)
Only two, never three
Fidelity
