Caught in a quicksand
And I'm starting to sink
So tired of struggling
That my mind can barely think
I don't know where I'm going
Lord, I don't know what I'm gonna do

My Fuel supply is finished
There ain't nothing left to burn
I need someone to help me
But I don't know which way to turn
I know I don't have much of a choice
I'll go out of my mind
Or into the night

I'm rolling and tumbling
Spinning end over end
Got to have some peace and quiet
So I can find myself again
Still if you ask me what's the matter
I just don't know what to say

There's people all around me
But I feel so alone
I guess they'd like to help me
But I have to do it on my own
I know I don't have much of a choice
I'll go out of my mind
Or into the night
