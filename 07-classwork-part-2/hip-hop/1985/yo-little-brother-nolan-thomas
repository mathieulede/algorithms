I got a brother younger than I
And my little brother's on the wild side
He's hangin' out getting high always on the scene
And always rappin' to the girls for some...
You know what I mean

And when pop came in tonight, he found
Little brother was not around
He looked up, checked the clock and said:
Go and get him from off the block

I called yo, yo little brother
What ya out here trying to discover
Yo, yo, yo little brother
Ya gonna get it from your dad and your mother

I checked every place I thought he might of gone
Until I came across a house with something going on
I looked in the window, there was brother and his crew
And he was doing everything a little brother shouldn't do

I'm not gonna call his name
His name is not his type of thing
I said: what you doing up after three?
He said: you don't know, you better hang with me

I called yo, yo little brother
What ya out here trying to discover
Yo, yo, yo little brother
Ya gonna get it from your dad and your mother

I called yo, yo little brother
What ya out here trying to discover
Yo, yo, yo little brother
It's gonna hurt you one way the other

I said if you think you're cool, don't be a fool
Little brother come home with me
He said: there's nothing home that can turn me on
That's why I'm out here in the streets

And what's up with you, you did it too
So don't tell me how to beware
I said: yeah, I was down but I turned around
And that's why I'm still here little brother

I called yo, yo little brother
What ya out here trying to discover
Yo, yo, yo little brother
Ya gonna get it from your dad and your mother

I called yo, yo little brother
What ya out here trying to discover
Yo, yo, yo little brother
Let's go home and rap with one another
