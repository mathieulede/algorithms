Everybody`s dancing
With a new determination
But that you didn`t know
Dancing is the move
When you do the oscillation
Let your body go

We`ll let you know
We`ve got only good intentions
It`s all right
Just do it with conviction
(Everybody)

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Everybody dance
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Everybody dance

Everybody`s cool in the mood
No insurrection
But that you didn`t know
Body rock conviction
With a dancer`s great sensation
You got to lose control

We`ll let you know
We`ve got only good intentions
It`s all right
Just do it with convictions
(Everybody)

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Everybody dance
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Everybody dance

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Everybody dance
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Everybody dance

Now everybody`s dancing
With the new determination
But that you didn`t know
Dancing is the move
Played with further isolation
So let your body go

We`ll let you know
We`ve got only good intentions
It`s all right
Just do it with convictions
(Everybody)
We`ll let you know
We`ll let you know
(Everybody)

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Everybody dance
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Everybody dance

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Everybody dance
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Everybody dance
