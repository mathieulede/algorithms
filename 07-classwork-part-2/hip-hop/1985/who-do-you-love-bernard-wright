Please let me make a true confession
I have never been in love before
But since you came in my direction
I've had a change, a change of heart
My girl had come a dime a dozen
I fed them the things they love to hear
I never was wanting for a lover
But I never knew what true love was indeed

Chorus x2
Who do you love?
-Girl I'm in love with you
Are you for sure?
-Sure as the sky is blue
Who do you love?
-Just let me prove to you
Are you for sure?
-Yes, girl my love is true

I used to be the great pretender
For the very first time I'm for real
You've got me listening to my heart now
You gotta believe, how I feel
I am ready to be become the giver
Now that I realized it's give and take
Oooh your love has broken my defenses
This time I'm not just on the make
I gotta tell you babe...

Chorus x2

Bridge x3
How do I know that you won't go
Please tell me
-I don't wanna lose your love
And if it's true I'll stay with you
-That would make me so happy

Chorus x3
