You're my heartbeat of life
And you fill up my mind
I wanna stay close, close to you

It's the old lover's spell
That you weave, oh, so well
Oh, it's a hold, holdin' me
Oh, you got to see

I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
All of my life around you
I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
All of my life around you
Hang around you

I get so hypnotized
When I look in your eyes
Oh, you can control, control me

I feel all butterflies
When I'm right here by your side
Whoa, I need your touch
Can't get enough, love me
Oh you've got to see

I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
All of my life around you
Hang around you

Spending every moment of my life
Within your gaze, my forever love
To have you and to hold you
So you never ever need to use
Your crystal ball to know
Where I'll be, always

I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
All of my life around you
Hang around you

All I want to do is
Hang around you

I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
All of my life around you
Hang around you

All I want to do is
Hang around you

I just want to hang around you
Every day and night
(Every day and night)
All of my life around you
(All of my life around you)
