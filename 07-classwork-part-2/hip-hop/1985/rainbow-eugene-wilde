Intro:
Your my Rainbow in the sky
That fluttles by and by
Whenever i 'm near you..near you lady
And your all i see it seems..
Your always in my dreams..

Verse I:
Let me take you by the hand
And talk about it..
If somethings on your mind...we can work it out
I want you to know..that I really care..
I wanna hold yout tight
Make sure this time is right...

Chorus:
Cause your my rainbow in the sky
That fluttles by and by..whenever i'm near you
Near you Lady..
And you all i seem to say..
I love you More each day
Yeah yeah ooh oh ooh oh...

Verse II:
Saying I'm sorry
Is not enough
I've treated you rough...lady please forgive me....
Eventhough, i know you heard me say it All before
But, give me one more chance..
To prove my love to you
There's nothing i would'nt do
To make it Up to you...
