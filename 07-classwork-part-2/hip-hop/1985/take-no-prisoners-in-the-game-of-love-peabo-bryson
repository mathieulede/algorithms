There's an all out war tonight
Here's our chance to win the fight
Or lose your life
Listen for the battle cry
Lay your heart upon the line
Tonight, it's time
Defend your crime

Oh, oh
You better get ready
Oh, oh
Cause my aim is steady

(CHORUS)
I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing
Or it's not enough, oh
I take no prisoners in the game of love

It's a one on one attack
I've got you cornered and
You can't go back to what you had
You can't do that

Oh, I've waited long enough for you
I want to capture everything
Your love can do
There is no rescue

You can't win
Cause I won't let you
Give in
Cause I'm coming to get you

I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing
Or it's not enough, oh
I take no prisoners in the game of love

You're gonna need somebody
When you let go
Of the fight on your hands
I wanna be the body
Breaking your fall
Holding your hand, ohh

Oh, oh
You better get ready
Oh, oh
Cause my aim is steady
Said my aim is steady
My aim is steady

I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing
Or it's not enough, oh
I take no prisoners in the game of love

I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing
Or it's not enough, oh
I take no prisoners in the game of love

(Take no prisoners)
In the game of love
(All or nothing)
Or it's not enough, oh
I take no prisoners in the game of love

(Take no prisoners)
In the game of love
(All or nothing)
In the game of love
In the game of love

I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing
Or it's not enough, oh
I take no prisoners in the game of love

I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing
Or it's not enough, oh
I take no prisoners in the game of love

(Take no prisoners)
In the game of love
(All or nothing)
In the game of love
Oh, take no prisoners in the game

I take no prisoners in the game of love
It's all or nothing
Or it's not enough
Oh, I take no prisoners in the game
