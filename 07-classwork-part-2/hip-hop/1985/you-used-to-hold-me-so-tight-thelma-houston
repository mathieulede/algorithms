[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
Woo hoo hoo hoo...
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh hoo
It's been such a long time
Ooh hoo

[Verse 1]
Hello my love it seems like oh so many years
That we have shared the love and oh so many tears
The passion that was ours has seemed to go away
One hug and then one kiss is all that I've received today

Hey, hey...
Oh how I long for the old good days
Oh, oh, oh, I still remember, baby
When…

[Chorus]
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight

[Verse 2]
Try to get back the flame that used to burn inside
Inside your warm embrace our love is still alive
Break down this barrier we've built over the years
Forever keep me close, hold me, oh, so near

Hey, hey...
Oh how I long for the old good days
Oh, oh, oh, I still remember, baby
When…

[Chorus 2X]
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight

Yeah…
Woo hoo ooh

Oh how I long for the old good days (I long for the good old days)
(I still remember baby) I still remember, baby
(You used to hold me, baby) Oh how I long for the old good days
(Squeeze me baby, make love to me all the time, babe)
I still remember, baby (I need you baby)

Oh, I miss you so much, baby
Oh, I really miss you, baby

[Chorus]
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight
You used to, used to hold, used to hold me, used to hold me so tight

I know our love is still hot, baby
Bring back the good times
Do you remember, baby?
(Oh how I long for the old good days)
Remember how we just really seemed to be in love with each other?
Do you remember?
(I still remember, baby)
