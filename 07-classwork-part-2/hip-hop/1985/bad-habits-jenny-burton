It's 2:00 A.M
Who's that ringing my phone?
It's you explaining why you don't wanna be alone
Now I should hang up after what you put me through
There's no reason for me to talk to you

Except that no one else can make me feel the way you do
It's a shame, boy
But my heart is hooked on you
You've been doing me wrong ever since I let you in
But it's your love that thrills me to no ear

I've got a bad, bad habit, baby
And, baby, it's you, baby, it's you
I've got a bad, bad habit, baby
And, baby, it's you, baby, it's you

It's 8:00 A.M
Who's that knocking at my door?
It's a lady for you, boy
Now I can't take no more
She's says that you're her man
And she came to take you home
But didn't you tell me that you were all alone?

I've got a bad, bad habit, baby
Oh, baby, it's you, baby, it's you
I've got a bad, bad habit, baby
Baby, it's you, baby, it's you

Bad, bad habit, baby
I know, baby, it's you, baby, it's you
I've got a bad, bad habit, baby
Oh, oh, it's you, I know it's you

You're a bad, bad habit that I should break
Don't wanna lose the love you make, oh, boy
But you're always in some kind of mess
I never know what to expect, no, no

Oh, oh, yeah

(Bad, bad habit, baby)
Oooh, baby
It's you, baby, it's you, yeah, yeah
Bad, bad habit, baby
It's you, baby, it's you, it's you

(I've got a bad, bad habit, baby
Baby, it's you
Baby, it's you)

(Bad, bad habit, baby
Baby, it's you, baby, it's you
Bad, bad habit, baby
Baby, it's you, baby, it's you)

Oh no, you're a bad, bad, bad, bad habit
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad habit
Bad, bad habit, bad, bad habit, yeah
Bad, bad, baby, bad, bad habit

Bad, bad habit, baby
I know, baby, it's you
Baby, it's you, oh, say you
(Bad, bad habit, baby)
Bad, bad habit
