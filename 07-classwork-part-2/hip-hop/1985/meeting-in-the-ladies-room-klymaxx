[Intro:]
I had to leave my condo to come to this
Well, I'm back
But this time I'm with my man
And these women are putting their hands
All over his Yamamoto Kanzai sweater that I bought

And I'm much, much unhappy about that
I'd hate to come down to their level
And become a BW
A basic woman
But if they don't stop
It's gonna get scandalous

[Chorus x2:]
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
I'll be back real soon

[Verse 1:]
I don't know
But I think you better watch your man
Cause girl, he's doing like nobody else can

If you wanna be sure
You best go powder your nose
Cause you wanna look good
When you step on the floor
That's why

[Repeat Chorus:]

Sing
Everybody sing it like
Sing

[Verse 2:]
Stepped through the door
They were standing in line
Smoking funny cigarettes
And taking their time

Pass me a mirror
Cause I ain't got much time
Cause there's a hunk of man I done left behind
That's why

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Walked on the floor
And everybody was jamming
They're playing my favorite song
Got me singing along

Can't turn your back for a minute
Somebody's rocking my man
And girl
They're doing like nobody else can
Watch out, watch out
Watch out

Excuse me, ladies
This man's with me
I don't like to share
You can plainly see

He looks good
Good enough to eat
But believe me, lady
He belongs to me, yeah

[Repeat Chorus x4:]

Don't slap me
Cause I'm not in the mood
Don't, don't
Don't slap me
Cause I'm not in the mood

Don't slap me
Cause I'm not in the mood
Don't slap me
Cause I'm not in the mood

[Repeat Chorus x3:]
