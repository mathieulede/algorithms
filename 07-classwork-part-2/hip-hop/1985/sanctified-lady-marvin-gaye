[Chorus: Gordon Banks (through a vocoder)]
Sanctified, sanctified
Sanctified lady, lady
Sanctified, sanctified
Sanctified lady, lady
Sanctified, sanctified
Sanctified lady, lady

[Verse 1: Marvin Gaye]
Some girls do and some girls don't
Some girls will, some girls won't (sanctified)
Some say yes, some say no
Some say stop, some say go (sanctified)
Some girls cheat, some girls lie
Some girls freak, some girls cry (sanctified)
Some like her, some like him
Some like that, some like him, I need a sanctified lady

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
What I want, a sanctified lady
Keep me warm, sanctified pussy
Keep me home, a sanctified lady
Keep me warm (sanctified)

[Verse 2: Marvin Gaye]
[?]
[?] (sanctified)
Some girls suck, some girls dance
Some girls fuck, some don't care (sanctified)
Some girls smoke, some girls taste
Some girls do some girl's face (sanctified)
Some girls scream, some girls moan
Scream with def, so I'm looking for a sanctified lady

[Chorus: Marvin Gaye]
What I want, a sanctified lady
A girl who got a sanctified pussy
Good to me, a sanctified lady
Make my conscience free, a sanctified lady
