[Verse 1: Jane Eugene]
I've waited, oh, so long
For you to come to me
What did I do wrong?
It's all a mystery to me

[Verse 2: Carl McIntosh]
Baby, I feel it too
What am I supposed to do?
Maybe I've just changed
Or could I be wrong for you?

[Chorus: Carl McIntosh (Jane Eugene)]
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(I'm not a plaything)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(Am I your plaything?)

[Bridge: Carl McIntosh (Jane Eugene)]
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
(With my heart, my love)
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
(With my heart!)

[Verse 3: Jane Eugene]
Do you mean to say
That after all this time
I waited like a fool
Now who been changing you?!

[Chorus: Carl McIntosh (Jane Eugene)]
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
(I'm not your plaything)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(I ain't no plaything)
You, you've got me hangin' on a string now
(stop masquerading)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(I ain't your plaything)

[Bridge: Carl McIntosh]
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
Come on, child, take me by the hand

[Outro: Carl McIntosh (Jane Eugene)]
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(I'm not no plaything!)
Stop hanging on the bus, I'm waiting on you
(no no no)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
Hang on, hang on yeah
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(Just a plaything)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
(You never told me)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
You never told me you were waiting, contemplating
(I didn't know)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
Come on child, take me by the hand
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
(I'm not no plaything!)
You, you've got me hanging on a string now
