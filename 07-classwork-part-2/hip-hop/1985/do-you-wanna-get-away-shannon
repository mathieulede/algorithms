Where can I run to find an escape?
I've had a very busy day
I need some fun
Some private space
I want to get away

To someplace where
There isn't a care or a worry
But it must be some place near
'Cause I wanna go in a hurry

Do you wanna get away?
Do wanna escape?
I can help you
I'm your lover, oh

Do you wanna get away?
My love can take you some place
Where you'll never be discovered
(Do you?)

I wanna get away, yeah
I wanna get away, yeah

No time plan an exotic trip
To an island in the sun
'Cause where can I go
And be back again
By the time tomorrow comes

Somewhere to find
A holiday is the question
Baby, would you mind
Repeating your lovely suggestion

Do you wanna get away?
Do wanna escape?
I can help you
I'm your lover, oh

Do you wanna get away?
My love can take you some place
Where you'll never be discovered
(Do you?)

Do you wanna get away?
Do you wanna escape?
I'll help you leave it all behind you
I know a place in paradise
Where even time ain't gonna find you
(Say yeah, say yeah)

Do you wanna get away
(Yes, I wanna)
Do you wanna
(Yes, I wanna get away, yeah)

I do want to
You do want to get away
I will take you
You will take me too

Do you wanna get away?
Do wanna escape?
I can help you
I'm your lover, oh

Do you wanna get away?
My love can take you some place
Where you'll never be discovered
(Do you?)

Do you wanna get away?
Do wanna escape?
I'll help you leave it all behind you
(I really wanna get way)
I know a place in paradise
Where even time ain't gonna find you
(Say yeah, say yeah)

Do you wanna get away?
Do wanna escape
I can help you
I'm your lover, oh

Do you wanna get away?
My love can take you some place
Where you'll never be discovered
(Do you?)

Do you wanna get away?
Do wanna escape?
I'll help you leave it all behind you
(I really wanna get way)
I know a place in paradise
Where even time ain't gonna find you
(Say yeah, say yeah)
