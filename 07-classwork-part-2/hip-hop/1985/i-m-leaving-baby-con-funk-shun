So it's late night after all baby?
You've finally made it home?
Since 9 o'clock this morning
I've been waiting by the phone

Gee your make up's kinda special
And you're looking mighty good
You said we'd do some talkin'
And now I think, that we should
You're gonna see all the pain you're causing me

I've seen enough, I'm giving up
I'm giving up love now baby
You won't find another love as strong as mine...
I've seen enough
I'm giving up, I'm giving up

Girl you say you love me?
And I'm the one to blame?
Said you're always thinking of me?
Well... it's too bad baby
You'll never change

And you won't find another love as strong as mine, no darling
I've seen enough
I've given up, Im giving up on ya baby
And you won't see another man quite like me
I've seen enough, I've given
I've given up sweet darlin'

Oooh baby I've seen enough
I'm leaving ya I'm leaving you for me
Leaving all the keys at home;
I'm leavin' baby, I'm leavin' you for me

Oooh ooooohhh And you won't find
Another love as strong as mine no darling
I've seen enough, I'm giving up
I'm given up love now baby
Ooooh And you won't see
Another man quite like me, no darlin'

I've seen enough, I've given up
OOh baby I given up sweet darlin'
Oooh baby I've seen enough
Believe me now I'm leaving you for me

It's over baby
I'm leaving all the keys at home;
I'm leavin' baby, I'm leavin' you for me

Its over baby
Oooh baby I've seen enough
Belive me now I'm leaving you for me

Can't take all this pain I'm holding
I'm leavin baby, I'm leaving you for me
Oooh baby I've seen enough, it's over baby

Sweet darling our love is through
It's over baby, I'm leaving you for me
Oooh baby I've seen enough
