I was so lonely though there was so many someone's waiting
I'm so glad that this ain't that
Girl you're the only reason I can make it through the long long day, and that's a fact

Baby, I can't wait to get next to you, oh I can't wait to wrap my arms around your body
Baby I can't help but to tell the truth
Oh it's so hard to wait till no one else is around
I'm gonna try to keep myself together
Till I find myself in you
Baby no no
Before they take you back to heaven
Gonna find myself in you, no no
I hate to keep you waiting
But there are some things that need my attention before I can get back to you
Anticipating my hands all over your body, baby you know
I know just what to do

And baby I can't wait to get next to you, oh I can't wait to wrap my arms around your body
Baby I can't help but to tell the truth
Oh it's so hard to wait till no one else is around
I'm gonna try to keep myself together
Till I find myself in you
Baby no no
Before they take you back to heaven
Gonna find myself in you, no no, no no baby

The only place I want to be is right here with you
Loving you down and you
You can take what you want from me
Long as you let me
Hang around
I'm gonna try to keep myself together
Till I find myself in you
Oh Baby
Before they take you back to heaven
Gonna find myself in you, oh baby
I'm gonna keep myself together
Till I find myself in you
Oh, baby, baby
Before they take you back to heaven
Gonna find myself in you
Listen, listen
