[Chorus x2:]
Now Walk It Out [x4]
Westside Walk It Out, Southside Walk It Out, Eastside Walk It Out, Northside Walk It Out

[Andre 3000:]
Now Walk It Out Like A Usher
If You Say Real Talk I Probably Won't Trust Ya
If You Wanna Go To War, The Gunz My Pleasure
Even Jesus Had 12 Disiples On The Level,Trigger, Whatever
Pumm You Dont Want Naw Dega 3 Thou
I'm Like Jury Duty Your New To This Part Of Town
Your White Tee Will To Me Looks Like A Nightgown
Make Ya Mama Proud Take That Thing To Sizes Down
Then You Look Like The Man That You Are Or Wat You Could Be
I Could
I Give A Damn 'bout Your Car But Then That Would Be
If It Was Considered A Classic Before The Drastic Change In Production When Cars Were Metal Instead Of Plastic Value
Is Wat I'm Talkin About
Take Two Of These And Walk It Out
You Be The Reason They Talk It Out
You Can't Be The King In The Parkin Lot-- Forever
Not Sayin I'm The Best But Till They Find Sumthin Better
I Am Here No Fear Right Me A Letter 'till Then
I Walk It Out [x7] I Westside Walk It O-O-Out [x3] Then Eastside Walk It O-O-Out

[Dj Unk:]
I Walk It Out The Bank With Alot Of Zeros
Thats Wat My Teachers Call Me Predictions Like They Cleo
So I Did My Dance For'm
They Make Bout 40,000
I Do That In A Month I'm No Resorts And Islands
I Make Them Walk It Out Yeah Its Me Again
But I'm With Jones That Phat Stacks And Benjamin
I Roll With Made Men
That Brakes The Stage In
And Keep The Girls Happy
So Yall Can Get The Nappy
Gansta's They Do They Dance They Do It To My Song
See I Was Up In Cali Crip Walkin It All Night Long
Drop 20 On My Neck Got 10 On They Wrist
A Billion Dolla Look A Million Dolla Kiss
I'm Nation Wide Homie You Still At Home Homie
With No Promotions On Me Man Thats Boloney Homie
The Album Off In Stores Im Beatin Down Ya Block
Now Goin Walk It Out And They Still On My Jock

[Chorus:]
Now Walk It Out [x4]
Westside Walk It Out, Southside Walk It Out, Eastside Walk It Out, Northside Walk It Out

[Jim Jones:]
Jones, Its Dipset Byrd Gang, Holla At Me, You Know How We Get It Up Here

Eastside Walk It Out Bronx Walk It Out
Queens Walk It Out You Know Brooklyn Walk It Out
Now Harlem Walk It Out Harlem Walk It Out Harlem Walk It Out Harlem Walk Shit Out
Now We Dont Walk It Out We Drop Top Porsha It Out
After I Floss It Out I Bring My Air Forces Out
I'm Blowin Purple Smoke I Cough It Out
Ball It Up And Ball It Out Tap The Bottle And Then Pour It Out Bbbbbbbbbaaaaaaallllllllllllllliiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnn
Now Do The Fade Away And Throw Some Paper Away
Now We Can Skate Away Tell The Hoe's I'll Be Late Today
Or I Can Thug It Out Or Star Studd It Out
I Take A Trip With My B**** And Louie Luggage Out
I'm Talkin Magic City Or Even Body Tap
You Know That Money Ant A Thing We Throwin Thousands Stacks
Oh Yeah We Toss It Out You Know What I'm Talkin 'bout
When Capo Status In The House You Know New York Is Out
