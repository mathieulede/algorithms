[Intro]
Ayo, you
You that just flipped on the CD player
I just wanna inform you that when you got somebody good
You hold on to 'em
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Must be nice
Havin' someone who understands the life you live
Must be nice
Havin' someone who's slow to take and quick to give
Must be nice
Havin' someone who sticks around when the rough times get thick
Someone who's smile is bright enough to make the projects feel like a mansion
Must be nice
Havin' someone who loves you despite your faults
Must be nice
Havin' someone who talks the talk but also walks the walk
Must be nice
Havin' someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You just remember to never let 'em go

[Hook]
'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone
She'll be by your side still holdin' on
And even when those 20's stop spinnin'
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear
She'll still be here

[Verse 2]
Must be nice
Havin' someone you can come home to from a long day of work
Must be nice
Havin' someone you don't have to show they know exactly where it hurts
Must be nice
Havin' someone who trusts you despite what they've heard
Someone as mighty as a lion but still as gentle as a bluebird
Must be nice
Havin' someone you don't have to tell you don't want to be alone
Must be nice
Havin' someone you can grow old with until God calls ya'll home
Must be nice
Havin' someone who understands that a thug has feelings too
Someone who loves you for sho'
You never let 'em go

[Hook]
'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone
She'll be by your side still holdin' on
And even when those 20's stop spinnin'
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear
She'll still be here
'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone
She'll be by your side still holdin' on
And even when those 20's stop spinnin'
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear
She'll still be here
'Cause even when your hustlin' days are gone
She'll be by your side still holdin' on
And even when those 20's stop spinnin'
And all those gold-diggin' women disappear
She'll still be here

[Outro]
Well I guess the next part of the story is
That after all this lusting and all this time I finally found me somebody for me
Somebody I could tell the way I feel about you
