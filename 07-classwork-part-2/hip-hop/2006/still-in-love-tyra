[Verse 1:]
What I gotta do
Everything I say
Everything I do

You seem to think
I can't tell the truth
What I gotta prove to you
(I'm still in love)

Even though I try
You seem like you'll
Never be satisfied

All you seem to care is who, what, when & why
I'm doing this and doing that
I just wanna throw it back

Back to the day
Around the way in V.A. (V.A.)
When everything was cool
And all I had to say
Was "trust me, babe."

But, now
No

[Chorus:]
Everything has changed
Will it always
And I know that it's all my fault

One night of pleasure
Really cost me
I'm the one so wrong
This time
The tables have turned

I found a really good man
No, I've gotta let it burn
Cause I'm still in love

Whoa, I
Baby (I'm still in love)
Still in love

[Verse 2:]
And I'm so proud of you (proud of you)
Cause not a lot of guys can do
What you do (what you do)

You stay true to me
So faithful (so faithful)
So what I got to do to
Prove to you (I'm still in love)

And I can't give up
Because I refuse to
Lose your love (lose your love)

It's only me and you
I'm thinking of (thinking of)
And I can't let it end
Can we start all over again?
Because

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge 2x:]
Hold on
Just don't let go
Cause I can't do without you
You won't hurt no more

[Repeat Chorus:]
