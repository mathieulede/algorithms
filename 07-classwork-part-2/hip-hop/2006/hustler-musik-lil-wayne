[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Hit me
Right in the sternum this time, T baby
Shit, you already know
You already know

Damn, shit
This that hustler music
Young Weezy got that motherfucking hustler music
So ride to it y'all
Vibe to it y'all
Damn

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Goddamn
Mix done hit a nigga in his head with this one
I'mma paint the city red with this one
I'm ahead with this one
See you fucking with the boy who tote toys
Way before Christmas
No assistance, just
That persistence, with
That commitment, if
I don't get it somebody gon die tonight
I know my vibe is tight
And I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain't right
Then let me die on this song
See I be riding, just riding alone
With my daddy on my mind
Like you gotta be kidding
How the hell you ain't here
To see ya prince do his thing
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear
But no emotions from a king
Shall be, so I be, who I be
That's me, that's Weezy F Baby
And please say the Motherfucking
So I be, who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby
And please say the Motherfucking

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Baby you gotta know
That I'm just out here
Doing what I gotta do
For me and you
And we eating
So bitch, why the fuck is you tripping
I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge
If the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No I won't budge, no
Lord

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Money is the motivation
Facing the avenue
Back touching the wall
Got the weed, got the gun
Gotta run when I hear the bird call (Brrrr)
Damn, hop in that thing and merk off, swerve off
You know me, they call me Birdman Junior (Ahh-ahh)
Anybody-murderer if Birdman sponsor it
Phantom of the Opera
All black, guap tent, locked in
I can let them shots out, you can't get no shots in
Bulletproof
Leave a nigga with a bullet-roof
Shoot ya in your mouth, Leroy, they call him bullet-tooth
I'm like, what it do, what it do
There's a full court pressure, I'm just going for the two
If I'm open for the three, I'mma take it in a second
Even if there's one second, I'mma make it, it's nothing
I don't take it for granted, I don't take it for nothing
I take it for what it's worth
To the dirt motherfucker
Yeah

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Baby you gotta know
That I'm just out here
Doing what I gotta do
For me and you
And we eating
So bitch, why the fuck is you tripping
I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge
If the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No I won't budge, no
Lord

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I ain't never killed nobody, I promise
And I promise if you try me
He gon' have to rewind this track
And make me go back
That thing'll go rrratt
That boy'll lay flat
So flat
That act
Is what I perform amongst you haters
Got
Nina in my palm, and I'm masturbating
Black
Peter Pan, fly til I die, what you saying
Bathing Ape, Yves St., Evisu what I stay in
Got me feeling like Scarface, light the Cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four-seater
You know I be out here, right in a four-seater
Top floor of the Four Seasons
Four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up
And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch bundle up
See, it's a cold world, so homie bundle up
We ain't on this grind for nothing
Now get your hustle up

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Baby you gotta know
That I'm just out here
Doing what I gotta do
For me and you
And we eating
So bitch, why the fuck is you trippin'
I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge
If the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No I won't budge, no
Lord
Baby you gotta know
That I'm just out here
Doing what I gotta do
For me and you
And we eating
So bitch, why the fuck is you trippin'
I'm taking these chances
My head to the sky
My feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge
If the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No I won't budge, no
Lord

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
