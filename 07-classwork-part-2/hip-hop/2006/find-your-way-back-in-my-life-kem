So ask yourself this question...is this how love is suppose to be?
And how is that you keep finding your way back in my life?

Said I'm leavin' Have I made myself clear
Everytime I find someone I find myself here...
No more screamin' there'll be no more lies
Packed up all my bags to go even made my flight...

So how did you find your way back in my life
How did you find your way back in my life
How did you find your way back in my life
How did you find your way back in my life

I can't tell it
How we make this thing fly
I really thought we'd work it out after all this time
But this ain't how love's suppose to be
In and out of harmony
So I packed up all my things there was nothin' left to say

So how did you find your way back in my life
How did you find your way back in my life
How did you find your way back in my life
How did you find your way back in my life
