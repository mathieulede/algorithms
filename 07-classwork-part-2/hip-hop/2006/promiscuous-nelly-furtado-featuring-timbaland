[Intro: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Am I throwing you off?
Nope
Didn't think so

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
How you doing, young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't have a player on the truck
I was at a loss of words first time that we spoke

[Nelly Furtado]
You looking for a girl that'll treat you right
You looking for her in the daytime, with the light

[Timbaland]
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night

[Nelly Furtado]
You expect me to just let you hit it
But will you still respect me if you get it

[Timbaland]
All I can do is try, gimme one chance
What's the problem, I don't see no ring on your hand
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent

[Nelly Furtado]
You wanna' get in my world, get lost in it
Boy, I'm tired of running, let's walk for a minute

[Hook: Timbaland and Nelly Furtado]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

[Verse 2:]
[Nelly Furtado]
Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute

[Timbaland]
Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at, do you mind if I come through?

[Nelly Furtado]
I'm out of this world come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?

[Timbaland]
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, Imma' lay mine's down

[Nelly Furtado]
I'm a big girl I can handle myself but if I get lonely I might need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health

[Timbaland]
I want you on my team
[Nelly Furtado]
So does everybody else

[Timbaland]
SHH! Baby we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down ain't nobody gotta know
If you with it girl I know a place we can go
[Nelly Furtado]
What kind of girl do you take me for?

[Hook: Timbaland and Nelly Furtado]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

[Timbaland [while doing that "chicka" noise]
Don't be mad, don't get mean
[Nelly Furtado]
Don't get mad, don't be mean
[Timbaland]
Hey! Don't be mad, don't get mean
[Nelly Furtado]
Don't get mad, don't be mean

[Timbaland]
Wait...I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on

[Nelly Furtado]
I can see you with nothing on
Feeling on me before you bring that on

[Timbaland]
Bring that on?!
[Nelly Furtado]
You know what I mean
[Timbaland]
Girl, I'm a freak you shouldn't say those things!

[Nelly Furtado]
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say

[Timbaland]
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like

[Nelly Furtado]
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P. like Steve Nash?

[Hook: Timbaland and Nelly Furtado]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm callin ya' name
But you're driving me crazy, the way you're making me wait
Promiscuous girl, you're teasing me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, we're one in the same
So we don't gotta play games no more
