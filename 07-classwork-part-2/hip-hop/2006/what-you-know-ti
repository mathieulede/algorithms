Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Ay, don't you know I got key by the three
When I chirp shawty chirp back
Louie knapsack where I'm holding all the work at
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Hey I know all about that
Loaded .44 on the low where the cheese at?
Fresh out the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Hey I know all about that

[Verse 1]
See me in your city, sittin' pretty know I'm shinin dog
Ridin' with a couple Latin broads and a China doll
And you know how we ball
Riding in shiny cars
Walk in designer malls
Buy everything we saw
You know about me dog
Don't talk about me dog
And if you doubt me dog
You better out me dog
I'm throwed off slightly bro
Don't wanna fight me bro
I'm fast as lightning bro
You better use your Nike's bro
Know you don't like me cause
Your bitch most likely does
She see me on them dubs
In front of every club
I be on dro I'm buzzed
Gave every ho a hug
Niggas don't show me mugs
Cause you don't know me cuz

[Verse 2]
Candy on the six four
Leather guts and fish bowl
Fifty on my pinky ring just to make my fist glow
Your bitches get low
Because I get dough
So what I'm rich ho
I'll still pull a kick do'
What you talking shit for
You gotta run and get four
Got you yelling and I thought you pull out a gun hit four
But you's a scary dude
Believed by very few
Just keep it very cool
Or we will bury you
See all that attitude's, unnecessary dude
You never carry tools not even square, he cube
You got these people fooled, who see me on the tube
Whatever try the crew, they'll see you on the news

[Verse 3]
Fresh off the jet to the block
Burning rubber with the top popped
My partners busting shots, I'll tell them "stop, it make the block hot"
Yo label got got
Cuz you are not hot
I got the top spot
And it will not stop
A video or not that will bust it 'til the Glock stop
Drag you out that Bentley Coupe and take it to the chop shop
Although we not y'all
If it may pop off
I'll answer the question "Will I get your block knocked off?"
This what it is bro
Look I will kill bro
I'm in your hood if you a gangsta what you hid for
Somebody better get bro before he get sent for
You say you wanna squash it what you still talking shit for
