You me girl we could do the thang

You me girl we could do the thang

[Sammie]
I know she like me I kinda dig it
So I did my thang for her she joinin wit me
Now we gettin groovy hotter than jacuzzi
So shorty want you slow it down
I see them other fellas and I ain't hatin
They try to do it like me it ain't the same
Front to back shorty side to side
And lean wit it (you wit a soldier now)

[Bridge]
Cause you so fly girl
You should come to my crib
But he gone flip
If he know you were here
I know I'm trippin but

[Hook]
You should be my girl girl girl girl

(you should be my) you should be my girl

[Sammie]
Its all over town and we we get into it
If that's the business, we should keep on doin it
Oooh you so grown wit it, you betta gone wit it
I luv the way you break it down
I gotta jones for you, all in my bones for you
Wakin up tree o'clock in the morn' for you
I neva sweat you baby, but if you let me baby
Know that I'mma put it down

You and me girl we could do the thang
Put you in the chevy let you grip wood grain
Put you in the range wit some apple bottom jeans
House of deron' and some Chanel frames
Got you on the celly got you callin Sharmane
Got you ridin good got you poppin champagne
Got you ridin dirty got you throwin up the A
Got ya lil niece callin semi all day
Chirpin on my NexTel on my 2 way
Sendin cute messages about dat face
Said you was grown told me dat you didn't play
And every since then it's been all like A
You and me girl we could do the thang
Tell them who yo man tell 'em why you bling bling
Tell 'em that your good, tell 'em that it ain't the same
Tell 'em Sean Paul told you money ain't a thang
