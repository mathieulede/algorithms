Imagine seeing him on the town holding another hand
She’s staring me down
So I figure that he told her who I am
But it don’t matter either way
What they do or say
‘cause ain’t nothing changed
He’s standing with her
But his soul is calling out my name

Chorus
In my mind I’ll always be his lady
In my mind I’ll always be his girl

Saw his mama just the other
Said he’d been through a spell
‘Had a bad break up
Thinks he’s on his way up
It’s hard to tell
She said
I think it’d do some good if you call him every now and then
You see he’s been through some things and I’m thinking
He could really use a friend

Chorus
In my mind I’ll always be his lady
In my mind I’ll always be his girl
Only time will tell if I’m his lady
But in my mind, I’ll always be his girl

Bridge
They say if you love something
You’ve got to let it go
And if it comes back
Then it means so much more
But if it never does
At least you will know
That it was something you had to go through
To grow

Chorus
In my mind I’ll always be his lady
In my mind I’ll always be his girl
Only time will tell if I’m his lady
But in my mind, I’ll always be his girl
