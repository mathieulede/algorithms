[Verse 1]
I used to think that I wasn't fine enough
I used to think that I wasn't wild enough
But I won't't waste my time tryin' to figure out
Why you playing games? What's this all about?
And I can't believe your hurting me
I met your girl what a difference
What you seen in her you ain't seen in me
But I guess it was all just make believe

[Hook]
Oh love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin' I found
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin' I found, found you

[Bridge]
Now you're goin', What am I gonna do?
So empty my heart, my soul can't go on
Go on without you
My rainy days fade away
When you come around please tell me baby
Why you go so far away, why you go

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Outro]
Love, never knew what I was missin'
But I knew once we start kissin' I found
