I had enough heartache and enough headaches
I've had so many ups and downs
Don't know how much more I can take
See I decided that I cried my last tear yesterday
Either i'm going to trust you or I may as well walk away
Cause stressing don't make it better
Don't make it better, no way
See I decided that I cried my last tear yesterday yeah
Yesterday, yesterday,  oh yesterday
Yesterday, I decided to put my trust in you
Ohh yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
Yesterday, I realized that you will being me through
There ain't nothing to hard for my god, no
Any problems that I have
He's greater than them all, so
I decided that I cried my last tear yesterday
Hey yeah, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
I decided to put my trust in you
Hey yeah, yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
I realized that you will being me through
There ain't nothing to hard for my god, no
Any problems that I have
He's greater than them all, so
I decided that I cried my last tear yesterday
