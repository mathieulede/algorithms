Yah, yah, yah ((Y'all know what this is

I don't know, if I ever felt like this before
But I'm sure, that the way I feel I don't want it ta go
Cuz I cried my share of tears
And I sang my share of blues
But to keep you over here, I'll do what I got to do
So baby
Janet((Nelly))

Nelly
See I, I never met a girl that could break me down
It's like I get caught in the middle
I get caught up a little anytime she's around

Lookin' to catch a hint and I
Doin whatever whenever never forget I
Said I'd be here when you want to
Get what you need if you
Wanna recieve oh please believe you could
((Janet))
Call on me, when you need someone who cares
Say the words and I'll be there

Call on me, anytime that you please
Babe whatever you want, babe whatever you need
Because you're the one I love baby just

It don't matter near or far
It's like anything you say I'll do
And it don't matter where you go
