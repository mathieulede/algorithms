I just want to ask a question
Where would I be if I didn't know you?
Who would I be, baby, if I didn't know you?

Who would I be if I didn't know you?
Where would I be If I didn't know you?
What would I be if I didn't know you?
Who would I be if I didn't know you?

You don't recognize it until you know I lied
Show the reason why my life has turned alright
Everyday I'm thankful at times I don't show you
The world would be incomplete if I didn't know you

Who would I be if I didn't know you?
Where would I be If I didn't know you?
What would I be if I didn't know you?
Who would I be if I didn't know you?

Every time you kiss me you make me remember
That sunny fall day at the end of September
Boy, I can't imagine no, what would I do if I didn't
Know you, you, you, you, you

Who would I be if I didn't know you?
Where would I be If I didn't know you?
What would I be if I didn't know you?
Who would I be if I didn't know you?

Well, oh, I feel
Baby, where, where would I go? What would I do?
Where would I be if I didn't know you, baby, baby, baby?
If I didn't know you, baby
Where would I be if I didn't know you?
