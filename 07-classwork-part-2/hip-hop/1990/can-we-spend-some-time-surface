I know, I know
I guess you're used to people approaching you all the time
I guess most of the time people probably ask you
Out to lunch, to dinner, to the movies
I just wanna know if it's possible
That you and I could spend a little time together all alone
Why don't you think about it, okay?
I can't believe what I saw with my own two eyes
The girl made my world spin all around when she walked by
I want you to know that I love you so
Maybe we could spend a little time to get to know each other
Can we spend some time together
All alone?
Can we spend some time together
All alone?
I know that so many guys approach you every day
But little time is all I need to prove the words I say, baby
I want you to know that I love you so
Maybe we could spend a little time to get to know each other
Can we spend some time together
All alone, you and me, can we be?
Can we spend some time together
All alone?
You're the girl, every girl want to be
You're the kind of girl, that I want right here with me
Can't you see that I'm in love with you
Won't you please tell me how you feel about me?
Can we spend some time together
All alone, you and me, you and me, baby?
Can we spend some time together
All alone?
Everybody knows, girl that I I love you so
And I want you here with me
Baby please baby baby please
Can we spend some time together
All alone?
Can we spend some time together?
