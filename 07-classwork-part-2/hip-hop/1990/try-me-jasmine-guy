[Intro:]
Hey, Jaz, what it sound like?
Sound like something we can work with!
Full Force, step to 'em!
Awww, yeah!

[Verse 1:]
Baby, I've been wondering
When will you begin to let me in your heart?
So I've been thinking to make the first move
And step to you
Tell you all I feel inside
(But my heart just falls apart whenever I see you)
Oh, that girl's so untrue
She don't appreciate you
(I would die if I could have a guy like you)
Kick your love to me
Cause I know what to do, baby

[Chorus:]
Baby, here's my number
You can call for free
If you want real loving then try me
I know how to love you
Look and you will see
If you want real loving then try me
(Try me)

Ex-Girlfriend for you, to sing
(Just try me, try me)

[Verse 2:]
I know that you want me too
But you're scared that
You will lose your girl and be alone
(But don't be a fool)
Cause a heart that breaks
Just may be your own, so
(Take a chance and dance with danger)
Bring out the animal in you
And I will tame you
(See, I wanna be able to train you)
Bring your love to me

[Bridge:]
And I will change your mind and soul
Leave it up to me to take control
(Ooh) Give my love a try
(Ooh) I want 'cha 'til the day I die
(Ooh) Take you oh so high
Make you touch the sky

[Chorus:]

Come on and just try me
Try me
You got a little taste now
Back to the base

[Vamp:]
(Try me)
When you're lonely and left all alone
When she don't bother to call you on the telephone
(Try me)
When she hurts you and never treats you right
(Try me)
When she slips up... huh, sounds like tonight

[Repeat Chorus:]
