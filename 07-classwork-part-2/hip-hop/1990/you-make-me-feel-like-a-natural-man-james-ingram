Looking out on a morning rain
I used to feel so inspired (Wah, ooh)
And when I knew I had to face another day (Wah, ooh)
Lord, it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
You're the key
To my peace of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural man (Man)

When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it (Wah, ooh, ooh)
I didn't know what was wrong with me (Wah, ooh)
Till your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful
To what I'm living for
And if I make you happy
I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural man (Man)

Oh, baby what you done to me (Done to me)
You made me feel so good inside (Good inside)
And I just gotta be (Wanna be)
Close to you , you make me feel so alive

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural man

You make me feel (You make me feel)
You make me feel (Feel like I do)
You make me feel (You make me feel like I feel)

You make me feel (You make me feel)
You make me feel (Feel like I do)
You make me feel (You make me feel like I feel)
