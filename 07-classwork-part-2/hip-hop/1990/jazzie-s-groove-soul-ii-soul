What is Soul II Soul?
Eh, well...we're a sound system
An amalgamation of good dance music
There is, um, three of us from the north side
And two from the east
And through our style, you know
People just came to recognize us
As the funky dreads

Well, you know, trust has always meant a lot to all of us
For us to stay together
Where one would make a decision
And the rest would follow
I don't know, you know
That's the way we thought
The way things should be
I guess the way things should go
Soul II Soul

I don't know, it took us a real long time
To get things together, you know
But hopefully we're on our way

Yeah, we started in clubs and so on
A little bit of pressure here and there
You know we had our ups and downs
For everybody who can remember Africa Center
The center of the world
That gave us the, um, idea to now make our own music
Creating our own styles here in London

The future? Ha, ha - the future for Soul II Soul:
A happy face, a thumping bass for a loving race.  Peace
