[Verse 1:]
One look in your eyes
And there I see
Just what you mean to me

Here in my heart
I believe
Your love is all I ever need
Holding you close through the night
I need you
Yeah

I look in your eyes
And there I see
What happiness really means
The love that we share
Makes life so sweet

Together
We'll always be
This pledge of love feels so right
And ooh
I need you

[Chorus:]
Here and now
I promise to love faithfully
You're all I need

Here and now
I vow to be one with thee
Your love is all I need

[Verse 2:]
When I look in your eyes
There I see
What all that a love should really be

And I need you
More and more each day
Nothing can take your love away
More than a just a dream
I need you

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Starting here
Ooh
I'm starting now
I believe

Starting here
I'm starting here
Starting now
Right now
I believe in your love
So I'm glad to take the vow

[Repeat Chorus:]
