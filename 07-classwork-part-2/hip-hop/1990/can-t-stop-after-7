[Verse 1]
Last night, I had the time of my life
It's true
Oh, last night, I made love for the very first time
With you

I never knew love could be so sweet
It never made a difference to me
But ever since the day that you appeared
I'm telling you made the difference
Now love is so clear

[Chorus]
And I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We're diggin on we
And no I can't stop (Can't Stop)
How I feel
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We're diggin on we

[Verse 2]
Last night, you brought something special out of me
Ooh wee
And for the first time, girl
You made my dream a reality
Indeed

I never thought love was meant for me
I was blind and could not see
You brought about a love that's so sincere
And I'm telling you, you've made the difference
Now love is so clear

[Chorus 4X]

[Bridge]
You've got me thinking that I need protection
'Cause your love is so strong
I don't wanna do wrong
Girl, your love seems like it's true
I'm asking you just give me a call
And I'll give you my all

I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We're diggin on we, girl

(Can't stop) I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel...

Can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel
(Ooh, can't stop the way that I feel, can't stop the way that I feel)
And no I can't stop (Can't stop)
How I feel
(Can't stop it baby, I can't stop it baby)

I can't stop
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
We're diggin on we

I can't stop
I'm diggin on you
You diggin on me
And we're diggin on we

[Chorus (until end)]
