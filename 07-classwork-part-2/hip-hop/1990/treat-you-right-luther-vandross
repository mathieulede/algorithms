I think I dream about you most of the time
What can I say? Hey, Hey
But I don't see you much
It's only once in a while
I want to know what you feel
I used to hang around
Being the toast of the town
What can I say, Hey, Hey
But strange how your friends
Can sometimes let you fall down

(change 1)
But you and everyone in the world can see
That I'm for real, honey
See, I don't know how to fool your heart
I just know what I know and what I know is

(chorus)
I will treat you right
Cause little darlin'
You've got to be mine
I see your love light
We'll have a beautiful time
All Night
I think about you, you're so fine
It just might work out if I treat you right

(verse 2)
I want to keep you close to the heart
What can I say? Hey, Hey
So I know, you will never ever, never go far
Cause I can feel if it's real

(change 2)
Though your friends say they still doubt me
They don't know of the you I see
And I don't know how to do you wrong
I just know what I know and what I know is

(repeat chorus)
(change 3)
You and everyone in the world can see
That I'm for real, honey
I don't know how to feel your heart
I just know what I know and what I know is

(repeat chorus and fade)
