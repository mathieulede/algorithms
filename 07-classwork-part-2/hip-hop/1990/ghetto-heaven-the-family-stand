You know I love my baby
My baby loves me
My day, it gets so heavy
I need a little company
It's quarter to eleven; it's time to make some ghetto heaven

Ghetto heaven
I need a little ghetto heaven

Nana likes brandy, especially peach
She keeps it by the radio
And listens to the Reverend preach
It's 10:07, and time to get some ghetto heaven

Ghetto heaven
It's time to get some ghetto heaven
Ghetto heaven
She needs a little ghetto heaven

Baby, baby, baby
All I need in this world is you
And when you're gone
Baby, baby, baby
Your touch, your kiss always gets me through

Sister needs her sugar
To get her through the day
She doesn't have the money
But always got a way to pay
It's 2:07; it's time to sell some ghetto heaven

Ghetto heaven
It's time to sell some ghetto heaven
Ghetto heaven
She needs a little ghetto heaven

You know I love my baby
My baby loves me
My day, it gets so heavy
I need a little company
It's quarter to 11; I need a little ghetto heaven
Ghetto heaven
My baby needs some ghetto heaven
Ghetto heaven
I need a little ghetto heaven
Ghetto heaven
