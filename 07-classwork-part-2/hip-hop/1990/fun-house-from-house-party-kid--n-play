Kid:
Alright yo
Could you.. could you be quiet for a minute, alright?
C.. Wiz, turn it down Dukes
Hey, could ya'll please shut up?
Wiz, chill!
Yo, Play got something to say

Play:
Alright yo, alright yo
Let's get this together cause it ain't gon' last forever
You know what I'm saying?
Yo, yo, man, don't trash my place
[Hey yo?] Hurb
Bass!

Verse 1:
They come from miles around to check out the sound
Watch the walls come tumbling down
Kid 'n Play is the perfect team
Now it's time to let off some steam
Don't be bashful now, don't be shy
This ain't no time for you to wonder why
You're not on the floor with someone else?
Don't blame us, blame yourself
You ain't got the guts to get with it
The time is now Dukes to admit this is the perfect situation to take a chance in
Cause this is a house that we dance in

Chorus:
Do a little dance now (like this ya'll, like that ya'll)
Feel the groove (I feel it, i feel it now)
Make a little love now (Ooh ah ooh oh ooh ah)
This party's at the funhouse (this party's at the funhouse)

Verse 2:
Now just go, let the beat flow
Not you crow, I don't want to come see your freak show flow
Smooth not slow, be a dynamo
Kid 'n Play says so and yo
Let's flip when the beat rips
Wiz got a gift and we got [the tune?] to shoot it
Your place of mind, anywhere's just fine
And when you're in the mood to unwind you'll find a good time
I'm looking for a great time
If that's too much to ask then I'll pass
Let's settle for a nice time
Anytime's the right time for a Kid 'n Play rhyme
Right here, just fine

Chorus:
Do a little dance now (like this ya'll, like that ya'll)
Feel the groove (I feel it, i feel it now)
Make a little love now (Ooh ah ooh oh ooh ah)
This party's at the funhouse (this party's at the funhouse)
Keep on singing, keep on singing (x3)
This party's at the funhouse (this party's at the funhouse)

Verse 3:
Only a few moments left to step
So you're best to step to her
It's your last chance to do her
You (uh) wanted to know what the good life is?
Beats by Hurb, Rhymes: Kid 'n Play and cuts by Wiz
Just hype it up for this here crowd
[?]
Last call for alcohol at the jamboree
Just get off the walls and cheer for me
Just rock when the beat drops
Watch the clock it's almost time to close up shop
And we got to hip hop harder
[?]
Look out for my father
Kid, make sure ain't nothing been broken
Last record ya'll and I'm hoping we don't get caught because i know her
If mom finds out, I'm over

Chorus (x3)
Keep on singing, keep on singing (x8)
