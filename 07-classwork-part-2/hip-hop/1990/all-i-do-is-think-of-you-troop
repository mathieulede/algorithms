[Verse 1]
I can't wait to get to school each day
And wait for you to pass my way
And bells start to ring
And angels start to sing
"hey that's the girl for you
So what are ya gonna do?"
Hey little girl!!!
I LOVE YOU !!! (i love you so...)

[Chorus]
All i do is think of you
Day and night (day and night that's all i do)
I can't get you off my mind
Thinking back (all the time)
All the time

[Verse 2]
I begin to take the long way home
Just so i can be alone
To think of how to say
My heart's here to stay
(hey i'm in love with you
I think the world of you)
So won't you please...PLEASE be mine?
(oh please be mine mine mine)

[Chorus 2]
All i do is think of you (baby)
Day and night (day and night that's all i do)
I can't get you off my mind
Thinking about (thinking about you all the time)
All the time
