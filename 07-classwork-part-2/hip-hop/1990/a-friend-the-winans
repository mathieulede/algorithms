[Intro: Marvin Winans + Aaron Hall]
Hey, what's happening, Aaron?
Oh, what's up, man? I'm so glad to be back
It's good to have you back
I can't believe I'm with The Winans
You know what? Somebody is with all of us...
Well, I know by being in this place that there's a whole lot of people that wants to know who this friend is. Why don't you tell 'em about it, Marvin
Well, there is a friend that sticks closer than any brotherâ€”and I got a lot of brothers, right? You know who that friend is
Why don't you tell 'em about it, 'cause I know...

A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Yes, He's a friend

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, there's no one to talk to
No one else I can find
But He's always there, He's everywhere
I'm talkin' 'bout a friend of mine
When problems seem like they'll never end
You have no one to turn to
You can lean on Him
He'll never let you fall and
All you got to do is call Him
He's just a friend

[Chorus]
A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more
A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours

[Verse 2]
It seems so crazy the way the times have changed
People seem to treat you so cold
The way they smile in your face and they talk behind your back
They're not like the friends of old
But I found a friend whose love is true
It won't change no matter what happens
Let's keep this clear, He's gonna be right here
And that you can depend on Him
He's...

[Chorus]
A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

[Bridge 1]
And if you ever need a friend
He's always by your side
And He'll never, ever, never let you down
He's a friend of mine, mine, mine
Mine, mine, mine, my friend
Yes, He is

[Chorus 4X]
A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more

[Bridge 2]
No night so dark, that He can't cheer us
No, not one...no, not one
No day so long, He's not near us
No, not one...no, not one

[Chorus 4X]
A friend, a friend, a friend, a friend
Friend of mine and yours
Out of all the love in the world
No one could love you more
