Yo, you Eddie check this out here
Why is it every time I see your face
It's only when I got gas in my Chevy?
There's something strange about that
What's up? It's just a
Missunderstanding I'm not so demanding
Never will you play with my heart
Missunderstanding I don't know
What you're planning never will you tear me apart
I know I must be dreaming all these brand new friends
And I've never seen such clever ways to make amends
You never know who's scheming is she out for self?
Nowadays you've got to be protected and it's not for health
Don't you know she drives me crazy, does she like my walk
Or maybe all she knows is that money talks money, money, money
It's a shame the way it is I really like her smile
I'd like to get to know her 'cause she drives me wild
Can you tell me why hey, you need diamonds, you need pearls
And I gotta buy 'em, oh I've got to buy 'em
Don't you know, don't you know to be my lady, to by my lady
Drive my Mercedes drive my Mercedes start giving me that lovin' hey
Missunderstanding I'm not so demanding
Never will you play with my heart
Missunderstanding I don't know
What you're planning never will you tear me apart
Can't you read between the lines? I never go for self
Should I try to sleep the lady and misuse my wealth?
I don't know the times have changed I can't sell out
I grew up doing right and I won't throw it out
Can you tell me why hey, you need diamonds, you need pearls
And I gotta buy 'em, oh I've got to buy 'em
Don't you know, don't you know to be my lady, to by my lady
Drive my Mercedes drive my Mercedes start giving me that lovin' hey
Missunderstanding I'm not so demanding
Never will you play with my heart
Missunderstanding I don't know
What you're planning never will you tear me apart
Yo Eddie F, are you in here? Yeah, ha, ha, ha, yeah

You know what time it is now right? Nevelle get funky
Missunderstanding, missunderstanding
Missunderstanding, that's all it is
Missunderstanding I'm not so demanding
Never will you play with my heart
Missunderstanding I don't know
What you're planning never will you tear me apart
