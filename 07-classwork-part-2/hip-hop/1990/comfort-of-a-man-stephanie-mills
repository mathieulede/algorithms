All the years of loneliness
Came crashin' down on me
But like a storm that's just been buildin' up {And buidin' up}
Too long

When I look inside to find me, mmm, hmm
There was no one there to guide me
And I'm tired, tired of trying so hard
To be strong

I need, I need, I need
The comfort of a man, oh, yeah, yes, I do, I can feel it
I need (Ooh), I need (Oh, yes, I need), I need
The comfort of a man
Man that understands
{Like the comfort of a man}
Woo, yeah, no, no...

Don't you think it's awfully sad
How empty life can be
I'd give my soul to someone who needed me {Just needed me}
For me

So afraid to reach out {Reach out}, mmm, hmm
So used to bein' without
And it's takin' so long, a time, a time for me
To see that I

I need (Ooh, ooh, ooh), I need (I need), I need (Oh, yeah)
The comfort of a man, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can feel it
I need (I want you to know), I need (Yeah, yeah), I need (Need)
The comfort of, of a man
Man that understands
{Like the comfort of a man}
No one, no one

One loving heart to reach to me
Two strong arms to hold on to me
Somewhere in your eyes I wanna tear, baby
Love shining through and I'm beggin' you
Baby, please, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah

I need (Ooh, ooh), I need (Oh, yeah), I need
The comfort of a man, ooh...
Sweet lovin' man, oh, yeah
Oh, ooh...ooh...ooh...sweet
Comfort of a lovin' man
Comfort of, I...

I need (...need), I need (I need), I need
The comfort of a man, yeah, yeah, yes, I do, I can feel it, Lord
I need (Yeah), I need (Oh, oh), I need
The comfort of a man (Of a man, of a man, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes)
The comfort of a man (I need, I need, I need, oh, yes, I need)
The comfort of a man (The comfort of a man)
The comfort of a man (Yee....hee...)
The comfort of a man (I want you to know what I'm talkin' about, oh, yeah)
The comfort of a man (Yee...hee...yeah, yeah)
The comfort of a man (The comfort of a strong man, the comfort of, comfort, yeah)
The comfort of a man (Yeah, yeah, doo doo doo doo doo)
The comfort of a man (Doo doo hoo...ooh...ooh...ooh...hoo...yeah, yeah)
The comfort of a man (A strong man, a kind man, a loving man)
The comfort of a man (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, ooh)
The comfort of a man (Strong man, a lovin' man, hey, hey, hey, hey)
The comfort of a man (I want you to know, I want you to know, I want you to know)
The comfort of a man (The comfort of, the comfort of, I know)
The comfort of a man (I need, I need, I need)
