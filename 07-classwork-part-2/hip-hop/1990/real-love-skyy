Don't be afraid of the way you feel
It's real love, boy
Don't be afraid of the way you feel
It's real love

I know it's not the first time
That you ever felt this way before
Ooh, but those memories are still lasting
Of the pain you got for your trusting
So when love calls you walk out the door oh
But this time, boy

Don't be afraid of the way you feel, don't be afraid
Open your heart and you'll see it's real, oh it's real love
Don't be afraid of the way you feel
Oh don't be afraid now baby

I'm not the one who hurt you, boy
And with love there's no real guarantee
If you believe in what you're feelin'
And you wanna make love to me, oh, baby

Don't be afraid of the way you feel yeah, baby
Open your heart and you'll see it's real
It's real love, it's time to do it right
Don't be afraid of the way you feel
Oh I need you tonight I need you right now
It's real love, oh now what you got to say baby

Darlin' you know it's hard for me sometimes to put
My feelings into words (why)
And I know because of all the hurt in my past
I tend to shy away from emotional commitments
But what I feel for you is so real and so strong
I couldn't walk away even if I wanted to
So baby I'm yours
