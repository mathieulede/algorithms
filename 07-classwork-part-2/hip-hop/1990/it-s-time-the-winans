[Rap: Teddy Riley]
Well, it's time to make that change
People of the world today are fading
All of us have our ups and downs
You better think about it or you won't be around
What we need is a little bit of love
Sent by One from Heaven above
Take it from "T.", it's simple and plain
This ain't no game, you know what I'm saying?

[Chorus]
It's time...time to make a change
We are the people who can do it
It's time...time to make a change
We are His people, we can do it

(Teddy Riley: Yo, Marv, kick it for me one time.)

[Verse 1]
What is the world coming to
Seems like everyone is running from the truth
We must stand up and fight
Walk into the light
We're the people, we can do it, if we try

[Bridge 1]
I know we can do it
Somebody asked me 'Why do we have to go through it?'
It's just a test of our faith
What we're living day to day
We don't know where, we don't know when
But He's coming back again

[Chorus]
It's time...time to make a change
We are the people who can do it
It's time...time to make a change
We are His people, we can do it

(Teddy Riley: Yo, Marv, kick it for me one more time.)

[Verse 2]
Jesus is spreading mighty fast
Earthquakes are moving through the land
It ain't nothing but a sign
Gotta make up our mind
We're the people, we can do it, if we try

[Bridge 2]
I know we can do it
Somebody asked me 'Why do we have to go through it?'
It's just a test of our faith
We're just living day by day
Don't know where, don't know when
But He's coming back again

[Chorus]
It's time...time to make a change
We are the people who can do it
It's time...time to make a change
We are His people, we can do it

[Rap]
Well, it's time to make that change
People of the world today are fading
All of us have our ups and downs
You better think about it or you won't be around
What we need is a little bit of love
Sent by One from Heaven above
Take it from "T.", it's simple and plain
This ain't no game, you know what I'm saying?

[Bridge 3]
I know we can do it
Somebody asked me 'Why do we have to go through it?'
It's just a test of our faith
We're living day by day
Don't know where, don't know when
But He's coming back again

[Chorus 6x]
It's time...time to make a change
We are the people who can do it
It's time...time to make a change
We are His people, we can do it

It's time...time to make a change
