You can never tell what's in a man's mind
And if he's from Harlem there's no use of even trying
Just like the tide his mind comes and goes
Like March weather when he'll change
Nobody knows, nobody knows
The man I love, well, he just turned me down, he's a Harlem brown
Off' times I wish that I were in this ground, six feet underground
He idolized me as no other could, no no
Then he surprised me leaving me a note saying he's
Gone for good

And since my sweetie left me, Harlem, well it ain't the same old place
Though a thousand dandies smile right in my face
I think I'll mooch some homemade hooch and go out for a lark
Just to drive off this mean ole Harlem blues

You can have your Broadway give me Lenox Avenue
Angels from the sky stroll 7th and for that thanks are due
From Madame Walker's beauty shops to Poro System too
That may those girls angels without any doubt
There are some spots up in Harlem were I'm told it's sudden death
To let somebody see you even stop to catch your breath
If you've never been to Harlem then I'll guess you'll never know
The power of these mean ole Harlem blues

Ah there's one sweet spot in Harlem known as Strivers' Row
Dicty folk some call 'em, one thing you should know
Is that I have a friend who lives there, I know he won't refuse
To put some music to my troubles and call 'em Harlem blues

And since my sweetie left me, Harlem, well it ain't the same old place

Dicty folk some call 'em, one thing you should know

To put some music to my troubles and call them the Harlem blues
Harlem, the Harlem blues
Harlem, the Harlem blues
