If I lost you now
It would take my heart from me
I can't imagine life without you
The love of you, baby

Lately, I confess
I've been short on tenderness
Too much time on work, I guess
Not enough on you
Now if I forgot to tell you I love you
I really got no excuse
No excuse

Because you're beautiful
My one desire
You're my soul's inspiration
And if I didn't say it
Well, I do now
You're my sweet inspiration, baby, baby

If I'm feeling low
I've only got myself to blame
'Cause I can always share the load
When I'm near you
Uh, huh

You can rescue me, baby
You bring out the best in me
I'm the girl I want to be
When I'm near you, huh
I may need reminding to say I love you
But heaven knows that I do
Yes, I do

Because you're beautiful
My one desire
You're a sweet sensation
And if I didn't say it
Well, I do now
You're my soul's inspiration

From the day I met you, baby
Yes, I knew insitinctively
Whatever our future
Together we were gonna be, baby

Huh, my baby
Nothing
Nothing's sweeter to me than you, baby
You, baby
Yes, sir
I love you, baby

Hey, now
I love you, baby
Hey
Ahh, yeah
