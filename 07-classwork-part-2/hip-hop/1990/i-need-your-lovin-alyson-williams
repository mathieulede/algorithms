I can’t stop think of you
I can’t get you off my mind
I need your lovin’ tonight
I need your lovin’ …. tonight
I’m so hooked on your love babe it feels so right
You’ve got me going in circles
I can’t get you off my mind
Although I try to be with someone else
I know it’s just a waste of time
Because deep down inside
I need your lovin’ and I need it tonight
I’m so hooked on your love babe it feels so right
My friends says I’m crazy
Because theirs no future in you
Baby I just like living for the moment
