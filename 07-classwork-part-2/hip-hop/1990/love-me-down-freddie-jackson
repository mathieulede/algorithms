Come to me again
It's been too long since we had touched like this
So we jump right in
It's like caving it up again
When I'm with you, baby

I don't care if you got somebody else at home
I don't care how might say
That it ain't right
This is our only change to be alone

Honey, you can be
He's forever
But you gotta be mine tonight

Just love me down
From head to toe
Let's cherish the moment
And never let go

Just love me down
Nice and slow
When it's seems like it's over
Just love me some more
And some more and some more
Just love me down

Feelings never die
You excite me now more
Than you ever did before
What I kept inside is a passion
I can't contain anymore

I won't ask you to make me any promises
That I know in my heart you can't keep
All that I ask is that
You give me tonight
What I always dream of
When I go to sleep

Just love me down
From head to toe
Let's cherish the moment
And never let go
Now just love me down

Nice and slow
When it's seems like it's over
Just love me some more
And some more and some more

Only you can satisfy me
Baby, say that you won't deny me
Let's make tonight our very special one

And now that we start this fire
We are slaves to our desire
We can't stop when we began
No, no, no, no
Oh

Just love me down
Just love me down

Just love me down
From head to toe
Let's cherish the moment
And never let go

Just love me down
Nice and slow
When it's seems like it's over
Just love me some more
And some more
