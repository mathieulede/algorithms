Who's that peepin' in my window?

Yo baby doll, I'm not tryin' to sweat you
But lately it seems like you haven't been givin' me 100%
Now you're gonna have to tell me somethin'
Is there someone else in the picture or am I still the only one?

I've been trying to describe the things I feel about you
What it is that's got me dreaming, all night creaming 'bout your love
Must be your kisses or maybe it's your smile
Or maybe it's the way you whisper sweet, sweet nothings

Tell me what's your secret, have you always been this way?
So sexy, so sensationally sexy
Hey, I've been around the world from Casablanca to New York
But in my travels, baby, there's been none that can touch your love

Here's looking at you
Here's to everything you do to me
Here's looking, here's looking at you, baby
I raise my glass and toast your love to ecstasy, ecstasy, hey

I've been trying to pretend it's really not that heavy
Maybe I'm not really floating, sugar, jonesing on your love
Must be my body or maybe it's my mind
Or maybe it's the way you whisper tender, so tender

Tell me what's your secret, have you always been this way?
So enticing, so enchanting, so inviting
Hey, I've been around the world from Madagascar to L.A
But in my travels, baby, there's been none that can touch your love, no

Here's looking at you
Here's to everything you do to me
Here's looking, here's looking at you, baby
I raise my glass and toast your love to ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy

Here's looking at you

Here's looking at you, sugar darlin'
Here's to everything you do to me
Here's looking, here's looking at you, baby
I raise my glass and toast your love to ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy

Here's looking at you
Baby, here's to everything you do to me
Here's looking, here's looking at you, baby
I raise my glass and toast your love to ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy

Must be your body, baby
Must be your mind, sugar
Must be the way you whisper sweet things
Tender, tender, sweet, sweet nothings

Must be the way you nibble on my neck
And wrap your legs around me baby, all, all, all night long, yes
Looking at you baby
I raise my glass and toast your love
You and I wrapped up in ecstasy, yes

Just when you think it's safe to come out of the water, baby
You go somewhere else, get on it
[Incomprehensible]
It's like going around the world with you

Must be your body, baby
Ooh, It must be your walk
Must be your body, baby
[Incomprehensible]

Must be your body, baby
Ooh, it must be your lips
Must be your body
Here's looking at you here

Play it again [Incomprehensible]
Here's looking at you
Must be your body, baby, ooh
Play some Queen Latifa song
Must be your body
Here's looking at you

Must be your style, it must be your grace
It must be you're freakin' me all in my face
You're pumpin' it high, you're pumpin' it low
The treble, the mid range, the bottom and mo'

I tell you specific your love is terrific
I'm shakin', I'm achin', the point that I'm makin'
Is should auld acquaintance be forgotty
I'm lookin' at you, kid, your body

Ooh, baby, ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, baby, ooh, ooh, baby
