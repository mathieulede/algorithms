I'm so sorry

I've been in love before and it let me down
Now I'm all grown up no turning back girl
Like a child's heart a play
You know the things we used to say
(you remember baby)
When we were in love we made

Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep

Girl when you broke out, I thought life would end
Now I'm all strung out
Try'na pick up the pieces once again

It seems no matter what I do
Bad luck has been my best friend
All of the things you used to say
They are just promises

Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep

Memories are the only things
That keeps me holding on, holding on yeah
Remember loving you

All night long

Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep

Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep

It seems no matter what I do
Bad luck has my best friend
Not to me those words you say
They are just promises

Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep

Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
Promises, promises we don't keep
Promises, promises we can't eat nor sleep
