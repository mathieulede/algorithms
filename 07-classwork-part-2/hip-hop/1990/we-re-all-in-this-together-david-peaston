Hey let's get together on this one
We're all in this one together
So everybody let's get in on this one
We need to be together

Hey did you see that, we saw him die
Then someone came along
And brought him back to life
At the same time
We're still letting people die

It's no illusion, running out of time
There must be something we can do to make it right
Oh, why can't we open up our eyes

There's no more time for confusion
There's only love to help us find a way
Let's take the life that we're given and try to
Make a brighter day
Instead of throwing it away

We're all in this together
It's up to us we can make it better
We're all in this together
It's up to us we can make it better

Send out a message that's loud and clear
Sing it to the world so everyone can hear
Oh why do we keep it all inside
Let's show them love instead of hate
What a difference it would make

We're all in this together
It's up to us we can make it better
We're all in this together
It's up to us we can make it better

Blinders keep us apart
Open your eyes, now before it's too late

Da doom dern, dern
Ba dum do do
Ba dam boo be but
But oh

Let's make a life for the children
We've got to try to help them find a way
?Cause all they've got is what we give them
Let's show them love instead of hate
What a difference it would make
