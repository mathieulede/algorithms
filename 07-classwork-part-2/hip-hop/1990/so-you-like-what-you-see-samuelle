Get with the program!
Get with the program!
Get with the program!

Everyday now i can feel you watching me from afar
And you been leavin' those love letters on my car (everyday)
So now i wonder - why you're so into me in such a way
That you've got to take your spare time to chase after me
(punishing)

Chorus:
So you like what you see?
You better put a hold on me
So you like what you see?
You better put a hold on me

The problem, baby
I'm not used to girls to shy (talk to me)
Now i'm impressed by sweet young ladies on a mission
To please their guy
So why, young lady, fall short of getting me?
About awhile
Now it's time you get with the program and learn to leave
Forcefully

Chorus 2x

Intermission

Chorus until fade
