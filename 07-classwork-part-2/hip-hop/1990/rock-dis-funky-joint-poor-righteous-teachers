[Verse 1: Wise Intelligent & Culture Freedom]
Time to get funky-new-radical hip as I get to the point
Rock this funky joint
Wait a sec, the teacher's got to check the intellect
Plus I must stepped in
To give you it but
But give you what?
The P the R the T for often come to teach the top but
Plus I be just enough?
To manifest
The fabric mathematic black be that of asiatic
Rock the teship track the static
And that you're rocking to my concept
Now guys I stand for this
For this wise, civilised in hip hop rhyme
From a black mind
To kicking it to you all the time
As-salam
You like a more a peace sign
Represents my way life and this be that of Islam
I take my time
Just before I manifest the rhyme
Sharp and act your witness stop the music on a dime
Knowledge me acapella wisdom G I'm manifesting
Understanding understood so there's no need
For keep you guessing
Follow me now, see
See I be rocking
The second hand is ticking still the posse don't be clocking
Controllers of the track we take it closer to the point
Rock this funky joint

[Hook x4]
Rock that funky joint

[Verse 2: Wise Intelligent & Culture Freedom]
It's time to step
The style that I use with
With also rather rapidly
PRT posse backing me
Easy now, star
You know exactly who we are
Poor Righteous Teachers child we PRT for short now
Now no, no more, hm?
Or am I too much for the mental
Proceed teacher please, just keep it sorta simple
Like hip hop, you're complicated
We are placing according to the moods of my intellect
Step the step
I step a little closer to the point
Rock this funky joint
But, but I'm your teacher, I teach you
Rocker when I rock you
The king [?] a different style of hip hop
Smooth like a wise words spoken from a prophet
Rough like a slave trying to get away
See I combine, with two kinds of rhyme
Trying to reach you
The knowledge of myself makes me a poor righteous teacher
Stop to flip the topic
Islamically I drop it
My duty be to teach so keep your pistol in your pocket
I self, lord and master
Travelling faster
As I get closer to the point
Rock this funky joint

[Hook x4]
Rock that funky joint

[Verse 3: Wise Intelligent & Culture Freedom]
Time to step yet
Yet, I'm on top of you
I, I have to get
The styles you be seeking and the words that I be speaking
Poor Righteous Teachers posse teaching
Anyone that lacks this style that I be styling
Mentally profiling, should I say I'm
Smooth with the roughness
Just serving justice
Suckers try to suck this
But, but I be scoping
Never I'm not sleeping
Because it's Culture Freedom, G
Whose posse rolling?
PRT
Word, B
It's sort of simple, see
Now look at me
The holy intellectual type and I write
The spirit always keep me something hype
I pick the mic, yo
Cause it's my whole life like, like I'm creating
Man I be festating
Can I say I'm great when
There's not another brother greater?
Turn to Culture Freedom for support

[Verse 4: Wise Intelligent & Culture Freedom]
But no excuses
Losers never rock this
Snakes try to stop this
Purify the holy hip hopness
Listen to the concept
Swept tech technique
Peace be the [?] from this world when I speak
As-salamu-alaykum
Alaykum my salaam
A universal greeting from the people of our kind
Step into the realm of my cypher
Feel the different type of
Come and [?] technique
Twelve hundred [?]
He's asking me to rock
So now I'm giving him the spot

[Verse 5: Wise Intelligent & Culture Freedom]
Style be the lyrics I be kicking
Intelligence be ticking
So it's symbolic to a bomb
Many brothers roll and fell a victim
I'm not living with them
Because they didn't know the time
Turn to Culture Freedom for support
