Save your love
Save it up
Save your love
Save it up

[Verse 1:]
How can I touch you so far away
I'll miss you more than
These words can say
I know you're lonely

But so am I
But when temptation calls
You remember you're my guy

[Chorus:]
Save your love
My love
Save it just for me
Save it up
Every drop till you're here with me

Save it all
Don't you fall
To my heart be true
'Cause I'm saving my love for you

[Verse 2:]
You know I trust you with all my heart
Still I get jealous
When we're apart

It's only human
You're gonna flirt
But if you get too friendly
Baby, I'll get hurt

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Kenny called me late last night
Hoping he could steal my heart away
I'll keep hanging up on him
All that I'm asking is you do the same

Save it, save it
Saving it just for you, baby

[Repeat Chorus x4:]

Save your love, save it up
Save your love, save it up
Save your love, save it up
Save your love, save it up
