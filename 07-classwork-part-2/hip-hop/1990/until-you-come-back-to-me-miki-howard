Ohhoohoh
Ohooh
So you dont wanna talk to me
Just dont even call me anymore
Though you dont call me anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess Ill rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I wanna tell you, baby
The changes Ive been goin through
Missin you, missin you
Until you come back to me
Thats what Im gonna do
Why did you have to decide
You had have to set me free, baby
I guess Ill swallow my pride
Beggin you, baby, baby, baby, please see me
Im gonna walk by myself
Just to prove my love is true, whoa, for you, baby
Until you come back to me
Thats what Im gonna do
Living without you might be
Livin in a world of constant tears
Hear my please, Ive got to make you see
Our love is dying
Oh, boy, your phone you ignore, somehow I must
Somehow I must, I must explain
I guess Ill rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
And Im gonna sit by your steps
Until I get through to you
Ive got to show it to you, baby
Until you come back to me
Thats what Im gonna do, babe
Until you come back to me
Thats what Im gonna do, my love, my love, my love
Until you come back to me
Thats what Im gonna do
Im gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane, baby, baby
Im gonna rap on your door
Tap on your, tap on your, tap on your, tap on your window
Im gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
Im gonna rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
Im gonna rap on your door
Rat-tat knock-knock on your window pane
Ill be there, Ill be there day and night
Ill be there night and day
Oh, Im gonna rap on your pane
