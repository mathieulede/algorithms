I always knew you would come for me
And now that you're here, my whole worlds complete
You gave me so much more, more than I'd hoped for
All of my dreams are realized, girl, you made me whole

Just when I needed a friend, someone who would stay till the end
You came along and made me strong
There are no words to explain all the joy you bring

'Cause in you I found perfect love
That one of a kind most dream of
I never though it could be
But in you I found everything I'll ever need

There were some days, girl when I
I felt so alone thought I'd die
But now that is past, I know we're gonna last

Because we were meant to be, girl, you're all I needed
You'll never know what you've done for me
You've open my eyes, now I see

I'm not the same, my whole world has changed
'Cause you're an angel in disguise
And to me it's no surprise that

In you I found perfect love
That one of a kind most dream of
I never though it could be
But in you I found everything I'll ever need, oh yeah

Loving you is all that really matters
I finally found, everything in you, I found love
That one of a kind most dream of

I never though it could be
But in you I found everything I'll ever need
Everything I'll ever need in you
