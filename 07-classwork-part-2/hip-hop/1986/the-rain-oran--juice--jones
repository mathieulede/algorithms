I saw you (and him, and him) walking in the rain
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same

Tossing and turning another sleepless night
The rain crashes against my window pane
Jumped into my car--didn't drive too far
That moment I knew I would never be the same

Cause I saw you (and him, and him) walking in the rain
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same

Now here you are begging to me
To give our love another try
Girl I love you and I always will
But darling right now I've got to say goodbye

Cause I saw you (and him, and him) walking in the rain
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same

I saw you (and him) walking in the rain
You were holding hands and I'll never be the same

Hey, hey, baby, how you doin', come on in here
Got some hot chocolate on the stove waitin' for ya
Listen, first things first, let me hang up that coat
Yeah, 'n' how's your day today, did ya miss me?
Oh, you did, yeah, I missed you, too
I missed you so much I followed you today
That's right
Now close your mouth
Cause you cold busted
That's right, now sit down here
Sit down here
So upset with you I don't know what to do
'n' my first impulse was to run up on you
And do a Rambo
Whip out the jammy and flat-blast both of you
But I ain't wanna mess up this thirty-seve hundred dollar lynx coat
So instead, I chilled
That's right, chilled, then I went to the bank
Took out every dime
And then I went and canceled all those credit cards
Yeah--
All your charge accounts
Yeah--
I stuck you up for every piece of jewelry I ever bought you
Yeah--
That's right, everything
Everything
Did fool out with me
Naw, don't go, you ever go, don't go looking in that closet
Cause you ain't got nothing in there
Everything you came here with--

Is packe dup and waiting for you in the guest room
That's right, what was you thinking about, huh?
What were you tryin' to prove, huh?
You's with the Juice
'n' I gave you silk suits, Gucci handbags, blue diamonds
I gave you things you couldn't even pronounce
Now I can't give you nothin' but advice
Cause you're still young
That's right, you're still young
I hope you learn a valuable lesson from all this
You know?
Gonna find someone like me one of these days
Until then, know what you gotta do?
You gotta get on outta here with that
Alley-cat-coat wearin'
Hush-puppy-shoe-wearing'
Crumb cake I saw you with
Cause you dismissed
That's right, silly rabbit
Tricks are made for kids, don't you know that?
You without me: like cornflake without the milk
It's my world--you just a squirrel, tryin' to get a nut
Now get on outta here
Ah!
Don't touch that coat!
