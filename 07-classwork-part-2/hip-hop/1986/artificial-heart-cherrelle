Artificial heart, baby
Artificial heart, baby

[Verse 1:]
Must have had a broken heart before
And found a way to fix it
By borrowing the love from other hearts
And never giving any back

Your father must have been a real stone cutter
And he molded you in his image
'Cause you're a chip off a hardened heart
A heart with no feeling

[Chorus:]
All I ask of you, love me, love me
Touch and kiss and hold me like you want me
But instead you're just
A man with an artificial heart

Artificial heart, baby
Artificial heart
Baby, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 2:]
Must have been a lonely heart to start with
To be so cold
Artificial hearts cannot be broken
And can never love anyone

How can you expect someone to give love
When they're not receiving?
Every person has a breaking point
A point of no return

[Chorus] (2x)

Artificial heart, baby
Artificial heart
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Now beat for me
