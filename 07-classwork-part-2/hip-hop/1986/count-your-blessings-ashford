Chorus 1:
I had to learn, learn a lesson
Never forget to count Your blessings
I had to learn, learn a lesson
Never forget to count Your blessings

You can't say I love You too many times
Simple things mean so much
Like when was the last touch
When was the last kiss
When did You hold them like this

Chorus 2:
I almost lost the One I love
Searching around for something new
Before You make the same mistake
Let me pass this on to You

Repeat Chorus 1

Though they don't complain
Doesn't mean that there's no pain
To forget is the worst
So always put them first
Thinking of their needs
Make them the One You please

Repeat Chorus 2

If You don't see eye to eye, come close to saying goodbye
Think how far You've come the victories You've won
What's kept You through the years was to dry each other's tears
Memories You recall let You know You have it all

Repeat Chorus 2

I had to learn, learn a lesson
Never forget to count Your blessings
I had to learn, learn a lesson, never forget

Repeat Chorus 1 and fade
