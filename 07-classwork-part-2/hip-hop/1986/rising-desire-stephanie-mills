Mmm
Mmm

Rising desire
Fire of the heart
Rising desire
Felt it from the start

Rising desire
Fire of the heart
Rising desire
Tears my life apart

Why do I feel this way about you in my life?
You weren't here for me
When I asked to have you near
Now things have turned around
You want to be with me
I'm tried to fight your love
But it so agrees with me

Rising desire
Fire of the heart
Rising desire
Felt it from the start

How can it be your eyes
So deep inside of me
Strange magnetism in your personality
It's getting scary how your presence shakes my life
I lose all self-control
When I'm with you through the night

To hold you in my arms
Is more than I can bear
But looking in your eyes
I don't know if you care

Rising desire
Fire of the heart
(Fire of the heart)
Rising desire
Felt it from the start
(I felt it)

Rising desire
Fire of the heart
(Fire of the heart)
Rising desire
(Ooh, ooh)
Tears my life apart

Yet still you haunt my dreams
As strange as it may seem
Love and desire
Burning deep within me

And you are the answer to my needs
But it seems like there's always something between us
And it tears me apart
More and more as the days go by
Ho, baby

Rising desire
(I'm rising, I'm rising)
Rising desire
Felt it from the start
(Oh, baby)

Rising desire
(I can't stand it, don't want it)
Rising desire
Tears my life apart
(Oh, oh, oh, baby)

Rising desire
(I can't stand it and I can't come back)
Rising desire
(Oh, oh, oh)

Rising
Mmm
Oh, I can't fight it
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't wanna fight it
Oh, oh
Rising
Oh, baby

It's in your eyes
It's in your arms, ooh
It's in your walk, baby
Ey, hey
Hoo

It's in your eyes, yeah
It's in your walk, baby
It's in your arms, yeah
Ho, baby

Rising desire
Fire of the heart
(Oh, oh, oh, baby)
Rising desire
(Oh)
Felt it from the start
(It's in your eyes)

Rising desire
(It's in your walk, baby, it's in your arms)
Rising desire
(Oh, oh, ho)
Tears my life apart
(It's in your walk, baby)

Rising desire
(It's in your arms, ooh, ooh)
Rising desire
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Felt it from the start
(Baby)

Rising desire
