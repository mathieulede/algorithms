Uh, ha, ha [1, 2, 3, huh]

There’s a fairy tale that says
Once upon a time
Funky music belonged to people who
Drank cheap wine

That’s why I gotta get on my own way
That’s the new golden rule
Enjoy the closest human
I’m much too hot to be cool
100 miles an hour, baby
That’s what it’s all about
I need a lover that can slow me down
Somebody that’ll make me shout

There’s a misconception that says
Everything on the one (everything on the one)
Then my first reaction is just try to
Have a little fun

That’s why I gotta get on my own way
That’s the new golden rule
Enjoy the closest human
I’m much too hot to be cool
100 miles an hour, baby
That’s what it’s all about
I need a lover that can slow me down
Somebody that’ll make me shout

Ugh, ha, ha, ha, ha

There’s a fairy tale that says
Twice in the Land of Oz (twice in the Land of Oz)
Dorothy make love to the Lion because
Because…because…

That’s why I gotta get on my own way
That’s the new golden rule
Enjoy the closest human
I’m much too hot to be cool
100 miles an hour, baby
That’s what it’s all about
I need a lover that can slow me down
Somebody that’ll make me shout, make me shout
Gotta get on my own way
That’s the new golden rule
Enjoy the closest human
I’m much too hot to be cool, cool, cool
100 miles an hour, baby
That’s what it’s all about
I need a lover that can slow me down
Somebody that’ll make me shout, shout, shout
I need a lover that can slow me down
Somebody that’ll make me shout, make me shout

[Twice in the land of Oz]

Because, because…

I gotta get on my own way
That’s the new golden rule
Enjoy the closest human
I’m much too hot to be cool
100 miles an hour, baby
That’s what it’s all about
I need a lover that can slow me down
Somebody that’ll make me shout, shout, shout
