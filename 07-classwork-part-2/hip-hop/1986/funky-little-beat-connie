I want to get to know you better
Seems like we both belong together
You rock my body like no one did
Full force and lots of care

Breath to the rhythm as I stared at the way you move
Lots of class as you stomp and grind
I like that move, boy you got that groove
Rockin' in the streets to this funky beat

This funky beat
(Funky little beat) Just you and me
(Funky little beat)
Rockin' in the streets to this funky beat

(Funky little beat) This funky beat
(Funky little beat) Just you and me
(Funky little beat)
Rockin' in the streets
Rockin' in the streets

Two o'clock, the party's still going and
All my friends, they're ready to go
Ohh you turn around, oh I smile at you
That's when you shy down
Forget just what you want to do

I'm gonna let it. You know obviously
What I want you to do to me
Why can't you see? It's so easy
You and me just rockin' with that beat (that beat)

(Funky little beat) Funky little beat
(Funky little beat) Just you and me
(Funky little beat) Rockin' in the streets
Rockin' with that funky beat (that beat)

(Funky little beat)
(Funky little beat)
That funky beat (funky little beat)
Rockin' in the streets
Rockin' in the streets

Two o'clock, the party's still going on and
All my friends, they're ready to go
You turn around, oh I smile at you
That's when you shy down
I give you all these clues
And you still don't know what to do
And you still don't know what to do

Rockin' in the streets to this funky beat
(Funky little beat)
(Funky little beat)
That funky beat (funky little beat)
Rockin' in the streets
Rockin' in the streets
