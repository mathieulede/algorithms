If we are one big happy family
No one would have to beg to eat
If we live in a world of dignity
No man would have to live on the street
If I tell you you're a part of me
There's no need for disbelief

Here is my hand to let you know
That what we dream
We all can hold
Apart we are weak
Together we're strong

Oh, people
We are writing this song
We're all living
These words together forever
There's no reason we can't live and be one

Build the world that we want together
For as long as you stand here by me
We'll live on

Think of all the possibilities
That the eyes of a child can see
Think of all the opportunities
That float right by you and me

Take my hand
And we will know all that we dream
We
Our own
Apart we are weak
Together we're strong

Oh, people
We are writing this song
We're all living
These words together forever
There's no reason we can't live and be one
