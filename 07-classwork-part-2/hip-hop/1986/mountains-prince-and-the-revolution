[Verse 1]
Once upon a time in a land called Fantasy
17 mountains stood so high
The sea surrounded them and together they would be
The only thing that ever made you cry
You said the devil told you that another mountain would appear
Every time somebody broke your heart
He said the sea would one day overflow with all your tears
And love will always leave you lonely

[Chorus]
But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if you just believe (oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, you and me

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time in a haystack of despair
Happiness sometimes hard to find (yeah)
Africa divided, hijack in the air
It's enough to make you want to lose your mind

[Chorus]
But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if you just believe (oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, you and me
But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if you just believe (oh yeah)
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, you and me


[Outro]
Mountains
