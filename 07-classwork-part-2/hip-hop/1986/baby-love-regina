[Verse 1:]
Boy
There's no one home tonight
The timing could be right
To forget the rules
We're out of school until tomorrow

Now
If only you would stay
There's so many games we'll play
Why should we pretend
To be just friends
When we could be so much more?

[Chorus:]
Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)
Baby love
(You are my)
Baby love
(Just call it)

[Verse 2:]
Once
Don't mean so much to me
I'd rather wait and see
See what happens
When the lights go down
With your arms around me

Time
To leave the world behind
Save it for another time
Cause I don't remember
Where I am
When you start to love me (love me)

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Baby
Baby love

Oooh, oooh ooh
Sweet and tasty
Baby
Baby love
Oooh, oooh, ooh

[Verse 3:]
Boy
I want you by my side
There's no reason we should hide
How we feel
When we are near each other
Undercover

Once
I hold you close to me
Your affection
First degree
Cause I don't remember
Where I am
When you start to move me (move me)

[Repeat Chorus:]
