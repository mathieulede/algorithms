All I want's a friend and you want mine
And you've been around for a long long time
I loved him but not like now
Something has changed and I don't know how

I'm at the point of no return
I'm at the point of no return
I'm at the point of no return
I'm at the point of no return

I've never been in love like this
You turn me around with just one kiss
I've never seen you in this way before
Now you got me wantin' more and more

I'm at the point of no return
I'm at the point of no return
It's taken me a whiIe to learn
I'm at the point of no return

No turnin' back, it's much too late
To go back now would be a big mistake
It's taken me a while to learn
I'm at the point of no return

I'm at the point of no return
I'm at the point of no return
I'm at the point of no return
I'm at the point of no return

I'm at the point of no return
I'm at the point of no return
I'm at the point of no return
I'm at the point of no return
