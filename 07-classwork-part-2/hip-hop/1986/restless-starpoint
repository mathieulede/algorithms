Restless
Do do do

Sunday morning, break of dawn
And I don't think I've slept at all
I toss and turn and body's yearning
Thinking 'bout you all night long

Feel the thunder in my heart beating
It's tearing me apart
I won't rest until you're here beside me
Sharing my love through the night

I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
Can't live without your love
I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
I can't live without your love

I tried to fight it, tried to hide it
Just another passing flame, well
Here today and gone tomorrow
But with you the fire raged

Over my mind, body and soul baby
You took complete control
I'm on the verge of going crazy maybe
You're all I want
Don't you leave me in the cold

I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
Can't live without your love
I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
I can't live without your love

I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
Can't live without your love
I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
I can't live without your love

I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
Can't live without your love
I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
I can't live without your love

I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
Can't live without your love
I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
I can't live without your love

I won't rest until you're here beside me

I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
Can't live without your love
I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
I can't live without your love
