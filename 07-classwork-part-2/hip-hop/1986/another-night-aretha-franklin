[Verse 1]
All my friends have to ask if I'm shattered
I say the past is the past and it no longer matters
I made my mind up
I can make it
I'll be fine
Even if I gotta fake it
I'll keep surviving

[Chorus]
Another night - without you
Another night - I know I can get through
Another night - it's only
Another night - I won't be lonely
Another night - another night
Another night - it ain't much
Another night - without your touch

[Verse 2]
I used to search through the crowd to find you
But I don't feel like it now
So don't look behind you
You better face it
I won't be calling
I hit my stride when the evening is falling
I'm going to make it
Another night - without you
Out where the music is loud and the people are laughing
I'm going to step on out
I won't be down
Going to stand my ground for just another night
Oh yes for a another night
I made my mind up
I can make it

[Bridge]
I'll be fine
Even if I gotta fake it
I'll keep surviving
Yes
I will

[Chorus]
