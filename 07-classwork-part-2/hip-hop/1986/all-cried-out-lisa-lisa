[Verse 1:]
All alone
On a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling

Inside
I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying
Crying, crying

And you
Don't you know
My tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire
Cause I'm tired of your lies

All I needed was a simple hello
But the traffic was so noisy
That you could not hear my cry

[Chorus:]
I
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain

And you
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

Oh, you
All over you
Ooh

[Verse 2:]
Never wanted to see things your way
I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool?

Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home?
How could I be so wrong?
Leaving me all alone

Don't you know
The hurt will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames
Why should I take the blame?

You were the one who left me neglected
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you've collected

[Repeat Chorus:]

I
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you

I left you so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Now I'm all cried out
Over you
