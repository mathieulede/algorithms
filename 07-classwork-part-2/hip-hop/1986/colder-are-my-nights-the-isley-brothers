It's looking better
More and more every day
Anything's better
Than the reason I've moved away

If those days can look brighter
Means everything is possible
For so long on my own
Had some time on my hands

The colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

The colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Uh, uh, uh
Uh

You made the difference
And what a difference it is
You made me realize
What is life without you

Since those days when nothing goes right
Things get almost but not quiet
They get so sore, they come close
They get so sore, uh, uh

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

Colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

The colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, ha
Well
Ooh
Mmm, mmm

The colder are my nights, ooh
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Means I need you more and more

The colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
Means I need you more and more
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
Means I can't do without you too long
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Hoo
Hoo
Yeah, yeah

(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
It's so cold, yeah
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights, ooh
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
So cold

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
It's so cold, well

Colder are my nights, yeah
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
So cold
(So cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
Yeah, they're so cold
(So cold, my nights)

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
So cold

Colder are my nights
(So cold, my nights, so cold, my nights)
I know it's cold, yeah, yeah
