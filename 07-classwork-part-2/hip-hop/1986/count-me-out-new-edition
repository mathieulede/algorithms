Count me out
Count me out

[Verse 1: Ralph Tresvant]
Fellas want to hang
And save tonight just for the gang
But you'll have to count me out tonight
If I can't bring my girl
(Ooh hoo)

Don't look surprised when I tell you that
(Ooh hoo)
Gotta spend some time with my baby, yes
(Ooh hoo)
So if that means we're gonna rain on your parade
(Ooh hoo ooh)

[Chorus (Ralph)]
You'll have to count me out
(You're gonna have to count me out)
You'll have to count me out
(I wanna be with my girlfriend)
You'll have to count me out (this time)
You'll have to count me out

[Verse 2]
When she asked me please
Could I say no and feel at ease
If you count me out tonight
She's gonna be with me wherever I go
(Ooh hoo)
She's got a sweet personality
(Ooh hoo)
She saves her kisses just for me
(Ooh hoo)
So if that means we're gonna rain on your parade
(Hoo hoo ooh)

[Chorus (Ralph)]
You'll have to count me out
(You're gonna have to count me out)
You'll have to count me out
(I’m saving kisses for my baby)
You'll have to count me out (this time)
You'll have to count me out
(Count me out)

You'll have to count me out
(You're gonna have to count me out)
You'll have to count me out
{My baby wants to be with me)
You'll have to count me out
(That's the way it's gonna be)
You'll have to count me out

Count me out
Count me out

[Chorus (Ralph)]
You'll have to count me out
(You're gonna have to count me out)
You'll have to count me out
(I wanna be with my girlfriend)
You'll have to count me out (this time)
You'll have to count me out

You'll have to count me out
(You're gonna have to count me out)
You'll have to count me out
(I'm saving all my lovin' for you)
You'll have to count me out (this time)
You'll have to count me out

[Bridge: Ricky Bell]
I love my baby but she's just a tease
And when I need her I say 'Please, please, please
Can I hold you? Squeeze you?
‘Cause I need you'
(Count me out)
(You'll have to count me out this time)

[Bobby Brown]
Don't count me out
Don't leave me out
(You'll have to count me out this time)

[Chorus]
You'll have to count me out (Count me out)
You'll have to count me out (Count me out)
You'll have to count me out (Count me out)
You'll have to count me out

[Rap (Ralph)]
Man, we're going to the movies
Then to the park
And play a little ball
‘Til it gets dark
That's what being young is all about
(Man, C-O-U-N-T me out)
Well, what about us?
We're your friends
We wanna C-O-U-N-T (me in
No, not tonight)
Where you going then?
(Tonight, I wanna be with my girlfriend)

You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out
You'll have to count me out (this time)
You'll have to count me out

Count me out
Count me out
Count me out

Don't count me out
Don't leave me out

[Chorus (Ralph)]
You'll have to count me out
(You're gonna have to count me out)
You'll have to count me out
(I'm saving kisses for my baby)
You'll have to count me out (his time)
You'll have to count me out

You'll have to count me out
(You're gonna have to count me out)
You'll have to count me out
(I wanna be with my girlfriend)
You'll have to count (me out his time)
You'll have to count me out

You'll have to count me out
(You're gonna have to count me out)
You'll have to count me out
(I’m saving all my lovin’ for you)
You’ll have to count (me out this time)
You’ll have to count me out
