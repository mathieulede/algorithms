Verse 1:
[Ecstasy]
Well there's love and life, both have four letters
But there's two, different things all together
Cuz I've liked many ladies in my day
But just like the wind, they've all blown away
You see, to love someone is atmosphere
But to both they'll share, when ones not there
There's no one way, it can be explained
I guess it's the way I smile, when I hear your name
It's the little things that you do, that mean so much
It's the care that you put, into every touch
It's the way I trust you, and you trust me
I guess some of us, are so lucky

[Jalil]
I was known for having, the upper hand
I was known as a stone cold ladies man
If it wasn't for you, I'd be that way still
But lately there's a change, in Jalil
Although my friends play games, and tease me a lot
I know I'm more than happy, wit what I got
When I get up in the morning, and go to work
See all day long, I stay alert
'Til we come home at night, and close your door
Two people sharing, one common cause
When I say one love, you can trust me
Cuz never have I been so lucky

Chorus:4x
[Ecstacy]
And we represent like this)
[Jalil & Ecstacy]
One Love, One Love
You're lucky just to have just One Love

Verse 2:
[Ecstacy]
Now the love I use to have just left me cold
I use to buy everything from diamonds to gold
At first I thought she'd left me, cuz I didn't buy her enough
Cuz she left me a note, along with all of my stuff
Said "baby, one of these days, you'll have to learn
That love is something, that you gotta earn
And once you earn it, you gotta know how to keep it
You got to want it, as well as you need it"
To have lost love, was a hurtin' lesson
But to have had love is a definite blessing
And I know what the Beatles were thinking of
When they said that money can't buy you love

[Jalil]
When you say you lost love, what do you mean?
I just went through, the exact same thing
M-m-mind was lost, for a whole different reason
I lost my love, because of cheatin'
Started roamin' through the streets, all day and night
Guess greedy best describes such an appetite
I wish I had her back, but it remains a wish
Guess a bird in the hand, beats two in the bush
Like to thank you girl, for teaching me love
Because all and all, I had a ball
Guess it's better to have loved and to have lost
Then to never have loved at all

Chorus:4x

[Ecstacy]
Well I think it's 'bout time, that we break it down
This is all about the love, that we lost and found
About the love that we missed, and the love that we shared
About the love that just, up'd and disappeared
About whos was bout real, and who was fake
So you can learn, from our mistakes

[Jalil]
Cuz see it was already written, done and said
So you can stay, two steps ahead
Of the L(echo), for the love which you give
The O(echo), is for the one who we live
And the V(echo), is for the vivrant letter
The E means may we last forever and ever(echo 7x)

Chorus: 2x
