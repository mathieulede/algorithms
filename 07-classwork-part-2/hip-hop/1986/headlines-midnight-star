Hot off the press
For everybody here we're gonna do our best
To make you holler make you scream
I heard it on the news it's an incredible scene

Our jamming is connecting everybody I heard
To make you party make you sweat
You're even gonna feel it through your TV set

[Chorus]

It got down to the part that it was rough and raw
Said you gotta do somethin' 'stead of nothin' at all
Because there's people you desire people you admire
You wanna go places before you get too tired
We want the truth about what's been goin' on
So we chitter chatter gossip on our telephone
Well now our time is running out we ain't got forever
Everybody wants a piece of lifelong pleasure

[Verse 5]
Turned to the classifieds searchin' through the lost and found
Heard it from a little birdie told me what was goin' down
Got your business in the streets
I read across the states he had to say you like to mess around
That's when I knew that you were sneakin' out all over town
I read it in the headlines

[Verse 4]
It got down to the part that it was rough and raw
Said you gotta do somethin' 'stead of nothin' at all
Because there's people you desire people you admire
You wanna go places before you get too tired

So we chitter chatter gossip on our telephone
Well now our time is running out we ain't got forever
Everybody wants a piece of lifelong pleasure

That's when I knew that you were sneakin' out all over town
I read it in the headlines

Headlining the news
Midnight Star's fresh new beat conquers the world
The Bears win the pennant
Lottery winner blows 40 million
I wish he'd blew it on me
Today's weather hot and steamy
I gotta go have a great day

We've got the beat
