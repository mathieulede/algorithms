[Chorus]
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Now I see that I could never live on borrowed love

[Verse 1]
It's three-o-one in the morning
Another sleepless night
I feel your presence with me and it doesn't feel right
And then it starts, flowing through me
From my feet right to my head
Then I scream, calling out your name
I want you back in my bed (my bed)

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Now I see that I could never live on borrowed love

[Verse 2]
Like a drummer, always beating, the inside of my soul
Hidden feelings, always seeking
The touch they knew so well, in the places that matter

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Now I see that I could never live on borrowed love

[Verse 3]
I can't eat, I can't sleep
Thinking about who you're with
Are you happy, making me crazy
You were the best I ever had (best I ever had)

[Chorus]
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Now I see that I could never live on borrowed love

[Verse 4]
The pain of too much pleasure, is all so clear to me
After you go nothing but ache to, fill my emptiness
Emptiness, emptiness

[Chorus](3x)
What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
Now I see that I could never live on borrowed love

What could make me think that I could live on borrowed love?
