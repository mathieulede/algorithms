I'm an ever rolling wheel
Without a destination real
And I'm an ever spinning top
Whirling around 'till I drop

Oh, but what am I to do
My mind is in a whirlpool
Give me a little hope
One small thing to cling to

You got me going in circles
Oh, around and around I go
Going in circles
Oh, around and around I go
I'm strung out over you

I'm a faceless clock
With timeless hopes that never stop
When I feel that way
You know my soul's at stake

Oh, but what am I to do
My mind is in a whirlpool
Give me a little hope
One small thing to cling to

You got me going in circles
Oh, around and around I go
Going in circles
Oh, around and around I go
I'm strung out over you

I'm strung out over you( I need you baby)
Uuh, I need (I need you baby)
Call me (I need you baby)
I need baby, my baby, my baby
My baby, my baby girl
