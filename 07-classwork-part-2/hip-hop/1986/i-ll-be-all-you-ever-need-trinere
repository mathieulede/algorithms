I see you, contemplating, your confused
So I'm waiting, so why don't you
Make your move on me
The feelings you hide
I feel deep inside when your near
We're both in a crowd
Your thinking aloud and I hear
You can't deny no no no
Whats in your eyes
In your eyes
Its plain to see
You want to be my guy

Chorus:
I'll be all you ever need
Satisfaction guaranteed
If you give me half a chance I'll be your girl
I'll be all you ever need
Satisfaction guaranteed
If you give me half a chance I'll rock your world

Everytime we meet
It's the same old thing
Incomplete
Thoughts are all you bring, so boy reveal
What is on your mind
Your so insecure
But I'll make you sure with my love
And when I am done
I'll be the one you think of
You can't deny no no no
Whats in your eyes
In your eyes
Its plain to see
You want to be my guy

Chorus
