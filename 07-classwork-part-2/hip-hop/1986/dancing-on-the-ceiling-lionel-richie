[Verse 1]
Come on everybody everybody ohhh ohhh come on
I said is What is happening here?
Something is going on that's not quite clear
Somebody turn on the light
We're going to have a party, it's starting tonight

[Chorus]
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh, what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling

[Verse 2]
The room is hot, and that's good
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood
People were starting to climb the walls
Ooh, it looks like everybody is having a ball

[Chorus]
Oh woo what a feeling(Oh, what a feeling)
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh woo what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh what a feeling when were dancing on the ceiling
Oh woo what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling yeah

[Verse 3]
Everybody starts to lose control when the music is right
If you see somebody hanging around don't get up tight
The only thing we wanna do tonight, is go round and round
And turn upside down, come on, let's get down

[Verse 4]
So come on,yeah come on let's get looseup
Don't hold back because it ain't no use
Its Hard to keep your feet on the ground
Because when we like to party we only want to get down

[Chorus]
Oh woo what a feeling
When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh woo what a feeling when were dancing on the feeling
Oh what a feeling When we're dancing on the ceiling
Oh what a feeling when were dancing on the ceiling
Shes dancing dancing dancing  dance dance dance
Dance dance

Dancing..dancing..

[Bridge]
You say what?
Hand in the air
Just get started
Everybody clap your hands, come on
Everybody have a little bit of sense

[Chorus]
