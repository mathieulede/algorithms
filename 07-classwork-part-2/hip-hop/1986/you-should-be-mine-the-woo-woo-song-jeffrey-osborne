[Verse 1:]
When you want all the love you deserve
And the heat's on your mind
Don't you even think about it
I'll be there just wrapped around you

I can't hold back
What I feel inside
It's just a fact

[Hook x2:]
That you should be mine
Anything you want
You got to fortify my love
You fortify me

[Chorus:]
And you woo-woo-woo
And you woo-woo-woo
And you woo-woo-woo
You should be mine, all mine

[Verse 2:]
Any way that your heart has been denied
Ooh, you can come to me
Every time that we're together

Just becomes the good thing we've got
And something this good can't be defined
One thing's for sure

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

And you woo-woo-woo
And you woo-woo-woo-woo
And you woo-woo-woo
You should be mine

[Bridge:]
In the height of your worry
Worries running too deep for you
When it all becomes too much, too much, too much
I'll pull you through

I can't hold back
What I know inside
It's just a fact

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

And you woo-woo-woo
And you woo-woo-woo-woo
And you woo-woo-woo
You should be mine

You should be mine
You should be mine
