Seems like yesterday
We were still children with all our dreams
Tomorrow's dreams
Only yesterday
You and I promised each other love
Forever love
But now you're gone

And our dreams are scattered
Like the leaves of fall
And I wish I knew what happened to them all

Cause no matter where I go or what I do
There's always you
No one but you
It's always you
Um, hum

Things change
People change
Growing up lovers can grow apart
So far apart
We dreamed different dreams
There I was watching you drift away

So far away
But I believe
That a love like ours was somehow meant to be
And I'll see the day when you come back to me

Cause no matter where I go
Or what I do
There's always you
No one but you
All, all always you

There's always you
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Ooh, hoo

It's always you
But I believe
That a love like ours
Was somehow meant to be
And I'll see the day when you come back to me

Cause no matter where I go or what I do
There's always you
No one but you

It's always you
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, yeah
Always
Yeah, yeah, always

Seems like yesterday
Um, hum
