I can take a woman or leave her alone
Temporary lovers come and go
You're the only woman that I've ever known
Who's got me losing control
Oh, I don't want to dream about you
Or wonder where are you
Oh, I wish my heart could beat without you
But have I gone too far

You say, I need you
You think that I need all the love you're giving
And I need you
'Cause living alone isn't really living at all

Never planned to make love a permanent thing
Keeping my emotions on the side
Kinda like my life just the way that it's been
Girl, I'm taking my time
Oh, I don't want to miss you baby
But that's the hardest part
Oh, I'm trying to resist you baby
But have I gone too far

You say, I need you
You think that I need all the love you're giving
And I need you
'Cause living alone isn't really living at all

Who decides which one we love
Or when we're going to fall
I don't need two hands to hold
Two lips to whisper

I need you
Like the air that I breathe through an open window
I need you
I can't let you leave and I won't pretend no more
