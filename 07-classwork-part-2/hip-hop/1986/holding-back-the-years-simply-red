[Verse 1]
Holding back the years
Thinking of the fear I've had so long
When somebody hears
Listen to the fear that's gone
Strangled by the wishes of pater
Hoping for the arms of mater
Get to me the sooner or later

[Chorus]
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on

[Verse 2]
Holding back the years
Chance for me to escape from all I've known
Holding back the tears
Cause nothing here has grown
I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all those years
And nothing had the chance to be good
Nothing ever could yeah

[Chorus]
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
So tight

[Bridge]
I've wasted all my tears
Wasted all of those years
And nothing had the chance to be good
Cause nothing ever could, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
I'll keep holding on
Holding, holding, holding

[Outro]
That's all I have today
It's all I have to say
