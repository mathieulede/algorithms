Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
When I'm standing beside you
There's a fever burning deep inside

Is there another in your memory?
Do you think of that someone
When you hear that special melody?

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

I often wonder how it could be you loving me
Two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
A rhapsody plays a melody for you and me

Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for
The one that I would wait for

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

Oh, mmm, oh
You're my desire, you take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep

I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you, oh

There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Oooh, saying I love you
I love you
