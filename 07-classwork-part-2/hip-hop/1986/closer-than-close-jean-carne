Closer than close
Sweeter than sweet
Closer, closer
Closer than close
Sweeter than sweet
Closer, closer

Just one magic look into your eyes
And I feel something deep down inside
Taking me higher and
I'm falling down under your spell

Oh, you're holding me tight in your arms
Got me reeling from your tender charms
Ooh I'm on fire and
I'm feeling things I'll never tell

You got me don't
Don't ever stop me
Just move me the way that you do
And we'll dance the whole night through

Just hold me close
Treat me sweeter than sweet
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, babe
Closer, treat me sweet
Closer, just hold me closer

I can't wait 'til Friday at 9:00
That's when I know that you will be mine
I'm feeling sensations
You make everything feel so brand new

If I had one wish to come true
That wish would last the whole night through
Keeping desire, going back and forth
Through me and you
You got me
So don't disturb me

Just move me the way that you do
And we'll dance the whole night through
Just hold me close
Treat me sweeter than sweet
Closer, hold me closer

You've got me
Don't don't disturb me
Just move me the way that you do
And we'll dance the whole night through
Oh babe, sweet
Hold me

Just keep on loving
The way that you do
Just me and you and again
Hold me, hold me
Hold me

Hold me sweeter
Hold me all through the night
Ooh, hoo hoo, I'm on fire
