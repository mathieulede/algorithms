What does it take
To win your love for me
How can I make
This dream come true for me?

Oh, I just got to know
Ooh baby, 'cause I love you so

I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
In every way I could
To make you see how much I love you
Ooh, thought you understood

Oh, you gotta make you see
What does it take to win
Your love for me
Gonna blow for you

And I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
In every way I could
To make you see how much I love you
Ooh, thought you understood

Oh, you gotta make you see
What does it take to win
Your love for me
Gonna blow for you

Oh, you gotta make you see
What does it take to win
Your love for me
