[Intro]
Free (x4)

My sugar is gone, I miss him everyday
Oh sugar

[Hook]
I'm sugar free
In the night
I'm sugar free
In the day

[Verse 1]
My sweet honey had to go away
For a little while
And when my candy's not here with me
I'm a helpless child, yeah

[Hook]
I'm sugar free
In the night (So lonely, so lonely)
I'm sugar free
In the day (So lonely)

[Verse 2]
I know he loves me, I know he cares
'Cause he's all mine
And soon he'll be knocking at my door
Things will be alright

[Hook]
I'm sugar free
In the night (So lonely, so lonely)
I'm sugar free
In the day (So lonely, oh sugar)

I'm sugar free (Oh my sugar's gone, he's gone away)
In the night (Miss him every night, everyday)
I'm sugar free (Oh my sugar's gone, he's gone away)
In the day (Miss him every night, everyday)

Every--
Every--
Everyday, yeah

[Break]

Free, free, free
Free-free-free

My sugar is gone, I miss him everyday

So lonely
So lonely, oh sugar

[Hook]
I'm sugar free
In the night (So lonely)
I'm sugar free
In the day (So lonely, oh sugar)

I'm sugar free (Oh my sugar's gone, he's gone away)
In the night (Miss him every night, everyday)
I'm sugar free (Oh my sugar's gone, he's gone away)
In the day (Miss him every night, everyday)
(Repeat until fade)
