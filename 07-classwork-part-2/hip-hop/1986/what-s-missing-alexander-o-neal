I just don't understand
How love so good can turn so bad
We just don't walk away, girl
We've come too far last time to work it out

'Cause we used to have good love but now it's gone
So girl, let's try find out
(What's missing)
We used to have good love but now it's gone
So girl, we gotta try find out what's missed in love

(In our love)
In our love
(In our love)

I have to ask you girl
What would it take to make things right again
If we both do a little soul searching
We'll get back what we once had

'Cause we used to have good love but now it's gone
So girl, let's try find out
(What's missing)
We used to have good love but now it's gone
So girl, we gotta try find out what's missed in love

(In our love)
In our love
Sometimes I just don't understand

(We used to have good love)
Girl
(Looked around and now it's gone)
Now it's gone

(We used to have good love)
The love from you and me
(Let's try, find out what's missing)
Now it's gone

(Let's try find out what's missing)

(We used to have good love)
Looked around and it was gone away
What's missing, girl ?
What's missing with you and me ?
Missing with you and me, baby yeah

It seems a lot it's like a maze
And the corridors change every day
I'm lost without your lovin'
Babe, let's find
(What's missing)

And if I have to change my way
To keep the smile on your face
I'll gladly do that for you
But let's find
(What's missing)

I'll come from New York to L.A
Swim the ocean in a hurricane
And all the time I'll ask you
Can you tell me
(What's missing?)

'Cause when I caught your lovin', girl
Meant more to me than all the world
I'm lost without your lovin'
Help me find
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Good love but now it's gone
So girl, we gotta try find out
(What's missing)
We used to have good love but now it's gone
So girl, let's try find out

Looked around and now it's gone
