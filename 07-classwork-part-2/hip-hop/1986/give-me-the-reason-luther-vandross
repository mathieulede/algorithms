[Verse 1:]
What's there to say
There's not much to talk about
And whatever happened
To all of the love that we vowed
Yes, it's true
And there's nothing new you can say

[Chorus:]
Give me the reason to want you back
Why should I love you again?
Do you know?
Tell me how how to forgive and forget

Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out

Never knew I'd ever be
Standing alone and outside
With no one to love

[Verse 2:]
I was secure and so glad
There was you to love
What in the world
Would I ever do without us?
But it's getting clear
That I have to get over you

[Repeat Chorus:]
Give me the reason to want you back
Why should I love you again?
Do you know?
Tell me how how to forgive and forget

Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out

Never knew I'd ever be
Standing alone and outside
With no one to love
No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love
No one, no one to love

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
You
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
Give me the reason to want you back
Why should I love you again?
Do you know?
Tell me how how to forgive and forget

Give me the reason to love you now
It's been a mighty long time
And the love that used to be
Ended the day you walked out

Give me the reason
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl

Give me the reason
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you
To love you, girl
Ooh

To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
To love you, girl
