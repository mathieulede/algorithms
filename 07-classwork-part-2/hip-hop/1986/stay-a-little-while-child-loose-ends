[Verse 1: Jane Eugene]
Put your loving arms around me boy
Hold me like I was a cuddly toy
Let me feel that warmth of your embrace
Don't let go
It's just a waste of time
So why pretend
When I think you know we more than friends
Must we let our future roll on ice
Why shake the dice
So why don't you

[Chorus]
Stay a little while child

[Verse 2]
[Carl McIntosh]
If I just want to stay friends
Will that bring us closer to the end
And do we need to escalade the situation
Or should I let it go
No I don't wanna let it go
[Jane Eugene]
Now there could be no sadder sight to see
That if we were to miss this opportunity
So send me up a signal and I'll catch the line
If there's not time you know it's up to you
So why don't you

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Jane Eugene & Carl McIntosh]
There's no need to act surprised
Cause there's no room for surplus pride
So let's push love to the limit and life to the edge
I've only one request of you
Stay awhile

[Chorus]
