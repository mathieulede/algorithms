Some habits are too hard to break
You give in, then you're hooked on what you take
Why don't you come close, I need an overdose

Because you've got me
You got me, Under The Influence
Of a four-letter word on my mind
You got me, Under The Influence
And I'll do anything anytime

My empty nights, you fill them up
I don't know when, to say I've had enough
Intoxicate me, with every kiss you've got
I know I must be

I must be Under The Influence
Of a four-letter word on my mind
You got me, Under The Influence
And I'll do anything anytime

I must be, Under The Influence
Of a love that is sweeter than wine
You got me, Under The Influence
And my willpower's so hard to find

I must be, Under The Influence
Of a four-letter word on my mind
You got me, Under The Influence
And I'll do anything anytime

I must be, Under The Influence
Of a love that gets sweeter than wine
You got me, Under The Influence
And my willpower's so hard to find
