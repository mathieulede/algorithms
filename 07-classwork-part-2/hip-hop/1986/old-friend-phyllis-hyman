A million times or more I’ve thought about you
The years of tears the laughter things we used to do
Of memories that warm me like a sunny day
You touched my life in such a special way
I miss the way you run your fingers through my hair
Those crazy nights we cuddled in your easy chair
Oh no, I won’t let foolish pride turn you away
I’ll take you back whatever price I pay

Old friend, it’s so nice to feel you hold me again
No it doesn’t matter where you have been
My heart welcomes you back home again

Remember those romantic walks we used to take
You held my hand in such a way my knees would shake
You can’t imagine just how much I’ve need you
I’ve never loved someone as I love you

Old friend, it’s so nice to feel you hold me again
No it doesn’t matter where you have been
My heart welcomes you back
Old friend this is where our happy ending begins
Yes I’m sure this time that were gonna win
Welcome back into my life again

Yes I’ve tried to live my life without you
Knowing I had lost my closest friend
Though I fell in love from time to time
Knowing I would never find
The kind of love I had when you were mine

Old friend it’s so nice to feel you hold me again
No it doesn’t matter where you have been
My heart welcomes you back
Old friend this is where our happy ending begins
Yes I’m sure this time were gonna win
Welcome back into my life again
Welcome back into my life again
Welcome back into my life again
