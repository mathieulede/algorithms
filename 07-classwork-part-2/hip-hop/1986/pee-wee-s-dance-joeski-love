Get busy, y'all
Check it out party people cause this party is burning
For a new dance I know you been yearning
This is for all you people concerning
A brand new dance called the Pee Wee Herman

Just move your hands into the front
And if you can't hear the music
Say, "Huh, what?"
As you doin' the dance
You might hurt your back
Just look at the crowd
Say, "I meant to do that."

It's the Pee Wee Herman, new dance sensation
Just go with the flow cause it's sweeping the nation
So c'mon everybody rock with Joeski
As we do this new dance called the Pee Wee

It's funky fresh so don't recycle
Just get on the floor and get off your bicycle
If you don't know how to do it you better start learnin'
This brand new dance called the Pee Wee Herman

Now, everyone just listen to me
As we do this new dance called the Pee Wee
You jump around act like a fool
Some think it's kinda dumb but I think it's cool
And when you start acting foolish you got it right
So let's do the Pee Wee Herman while I rock the mic
This dance is hot - in other words, it's burning
So let's do the dance called the Pee Wee Herman

Check it out y'all...
Now kick that beat...

They'll be doing the Pee Wee every jam you enter
So join us on Pee Wee's great adventure
It's not hard, it's easy you see
Just act like Pee Wee Herman, very stupidly
Some think it's dumb some say it's cute
Throw on a bow tie, a tight plaid suit
Your high water pants and your five inch heels
Now you look like Pee Wee Herman, how do you feel?
You might have the urge to talk to your food
While you're on the dance floor doing Pee Wee's groove
So listen to me and do what you're told
And don't forget to act like you're five years old
Like Pee Wee Herman, act like a jerk
And get on the dance floor let your body work
So y'all rock as you do it, keep the turntables turning
And let's do the dance called the Pee Wee Herman
