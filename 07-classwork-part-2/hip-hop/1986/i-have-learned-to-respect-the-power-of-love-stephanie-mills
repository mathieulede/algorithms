Mmm, hmm

A dee dee dee dee doo doo

I was a victim of my foolish thinking
Carelessly
I've risked my love and my life
There's no self-pity
I admit I obliged
Overpowered by love
I pretended to be blind

Faith has survived
All the doubts I've summoned
My heart has stood all the failure and loss
Helpless
I cannot further be driven, mmm
Ooh, ooh

I've learned to respect
The power of love
I've learned to respect

Running away from the one thing
