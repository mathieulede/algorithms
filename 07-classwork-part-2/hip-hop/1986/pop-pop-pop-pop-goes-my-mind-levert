La, la, la, la, la, da, da, da
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, no, no

I remember when you said I was the
Only one that you could give your love to
Your love was so strong
Baby, I admit I was wrong
Can we try to start it over

(Ba, ba, ba, ba)
Or has your love run out on me?
Tell me that you love me, girl
Baby, please have pity on me, baby, yeah

Pop, pop, pop, pop, goes my mind
(My mind)
Every time I think of all the time I did you wrong
Pop, pop, pop, pop, goes my mind
Goes my mind

I never wanted you to leave
I tried to love you the best I could
But baby, now I see, girl
My best, my best was no good
No, no, no, no, no

So please, don't say you're leaving me
(Ba, ba, ba, ba)
See, I can't stand to see you cry
Tell me that you love me, girl
But I don't know, I don't know why
My mind keeps saying, keeps telling me

Pop, pop, pop, pop goes my mind
(My mind)
Every time I think of all the times I did you wrong, baby
Pop, pop, pop, pop, goes my mind
Baby, my love was so strong

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, no, baby

You got me saying
(Oh)
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
(Yeah, yeah)
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, girl, aw, girl, oh, oh
I'm saying oh, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby

Please don't just say
Don't just say that you're leaving
(Ba, ba, ba, ba)
I can't stand it when you cry, baby

No, no, no
Tell me that you love me, girl
See, I don't know, I don't know why
My mind keeps saying, keeps telling me
