Ain't it funny
Destiny is pulling you back to me
Time waits for no one
I hope that nothing has changed
I've been thinking
I was taking more than I ever gave
I never thought
You knew the rules to my game
Here I am, turning back the pages
Of the book we wrote
Every word can be recreated
I want you to take no more

I'm coming one step closer to you
Now I'm on my way
Coming back to stay
One step closer to you
You're in my mind
You're in my heart

I wanted the road
A heavier load
I was, oh, so blind
When all that I needed
Was right here in front of my eyes
In this crummy room
It's so filled with gloom
Staring at the walls
If I can't have your love I have nothing at all
I believe a lot can be forgiven
A broken heart can mend
You will see a whole new situation
I won't be so misled

I'm coming one step closer to you
Now it's plain to see
What you mean to me
One step closer to you
You're in my mind
You're in my heart, yeah

I wanna be loved
Hold and hold on

I believe a lot can be forgiven
And a heart can mend
You will see a whole new situation
I won't be so misled

I'm coming one step closer to you
Now I'm on my way
Coming back to stay
One step closer to you
You're in my mind
You're in my heart

(One step closer to you) I've been thinking, pretty baby
(One step closer to you) You know it's all right, all right
(One step closer to you) (One step closer to you)
