Hoo
Hoo oh
Baby

Girl, I wanna sit you down
And let you know just how I feel
It's been a long time since I felt so strong
And much too long since love's been here

Now I know there's many questions runnin' through your mind
You're wondering have you felt true love this time
Have you found the one who cares, who will always be right there
I wrote this song just to ease your mind

Now your love {Your love to me is very serious}
I won't play games {I won't play games with your tender heart}
And when I look into your eyes and say I love you, girl
That's how I feel, I'm for real {I'm for real}, hoo

They say in life you take a chance
And in love there's no guarantees
But the sweetest satisfaction comes from sharing our lives
And tearing down walls of mystery

What we share is special, it's mystical
There's magic when I look in your eyes
Oh, but this is no illusion, I never want to lose you
Say you'll be with me for the rest of my life, oh, girl

(I want your love) I want your sweet love
It's the kind of love that you hope for and pray for every day
(I'll pray for you every day)
Guessing games, pretending (Pretend no more, darlin', girl)
It's all over (Oh)

Your love {Your love to me is very serious}
{I won't play games with your tender heart}
And when I look into your eyes and say I love you, oh
That's how I feel, I'm for real {I'm for real}, oh ho

(I want your love) I want your sweet love
It's the kind of love that you hope for and pray for every day
(I'll pray for you every day)
Guessing games, pretending (Don't wanna pretend no more, darlin', girl)
It's all over (Hey )

Your love {Your love to me is very serious}
I won't play games {I won't play games with your tender heart}
Oh, girl, when I look into your eyes and say I love you, oh
That's how I feel, I'm for real, hey {I'm for real}

I said your love {Your love to me is very serious}
Oh, oh, I won't play games {I won't play games with your tender heart}
Look into your eyes, girl, I say {Into your eyes and say I love you, girl}
Hey, that's how I feel, I'm for real, hey, hey {I'm for real}

Oh, your love {Your love to me is very serious}
{I won't play games with your tender heart}
Oh, girl, when I look {Into your eyes and say I love you, girl}, oh
I'm for real, and darlin', I'm for real, oh
