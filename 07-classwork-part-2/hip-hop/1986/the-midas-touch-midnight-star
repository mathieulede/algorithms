The Midas touch, touch, touch, touch

You say you're going through changes
Every day it seems your life is up and down
And you say that you're lookin' for an answer
Everywhere you look it seems you can't be found

Like searchin', tryin' to find the rainbow
No one's ever found it, yet it's told to be
But if you're lookin' for a lover
Everything you need, you can find right here with me

I've got the Midas touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh sugar
I've got the Midas touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Now you've been trapped by love
Someone takes your heart and then says goodbye
So you say that you'll never love another
Tired of playin' games and that's the reason why

But now whenever we're together
There's a certain feelin', that we both agree
And it's time that you've opened up to love
Cause if you don't ever try, then baby, you may never see

I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, yeah, darlin'
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Together you and I were meant to be
I'll be right beside whenever you need me
This love we have will never fade away
You can count on me 'cause I' here to stay

I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, yeah, darlin'
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
(Won't you do that for me?)

I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, oh, sugar
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul

Touch, touch, touch, touch
The Midas touch
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch
Touch, touch, touch, touch, touch

Together you and I were meant to be
I'll be right beside whenever you need me
This love we have will never fade away
You can count on me 'cause I' here to stay

I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, it's all in my hands
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
(Won't you do that for me?)

I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, yeah, baby
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
(Everything I touch)

I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, yeah, darlin'
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
(Won't you let me touch you, baby?)

I've got the Midas Touch
Everything I touch turns to gold, yeah, darlin'
I've got the Midas Touch
Baby, let me touch your body and your soul
