Patience gone
Time to move along
No one to blame
It is time to win
Don't criticize
Try to realize
I am number one in the end

Play to win
That is the color, the color of success
I play to win; oh, I
Play to win
There is no other
Color of success
I play to win; oh, I

Free as a bird
It is time to spread the word
Dark whether is gone
The sun is shining
First, understand
I am not your typical man
Shrewd, I am kind
You cannot deny me

Play to win
That is the color, the color of success
I play to win; oh, I
Play to win
There is no other
Color of success
I play to win; oh, I

Fresh, picturesque at my very best
Gratefully strong, and proud to be me
