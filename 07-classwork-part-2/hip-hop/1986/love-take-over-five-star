I can see what is on your mind
I can tell ‘cuz I know the signs
You were victimized
She played a trick on you
Don't relive what is in the past
Love will win ‘cuz the pain can't last
What she took away
I'll give it back to you

Don't think you're smart
Don't hide your heart
Don't think you're smart
Don't hide…

You got to let
Love take over
And when it's in control
It won't let go
Love take over
If you surrender to it
Love will pull you through
(don't think you're smart)
Pull you through
(don't hide your heart)
Love take over
If you surrender to it
Love will pull you through

I don't know what you feel for me
Your emotions are a mystery
I wanna let you know
I want you to stay
There ain't a thing that we couldn't do
I'll deliver.. let me work on you
Open up to me
Stop turning away

Don't think you're smart
Don't hide your heart
Don't think you're smart
Don't hide…
Don't hide…!

You got to let
Love take over
And when it's in control
It won't let go
Love take over
If you surrender to it
Love will pull you through

You got to let
Love take over
And when it's in control
It won't let go
Love take over
If you surrender to it
Love will pull you through
