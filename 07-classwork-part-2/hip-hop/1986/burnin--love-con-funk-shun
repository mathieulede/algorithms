[Verse 1]
When we first met I knew my life would change
With such intensity, I'll never be the same
But your taboo is hard to say that I was ever taught to think this way
You're everything I've always desired and when we touch we're playing with fire

[Hook 1]
Please don't ever let me go, your taboo
Even though I know your taboo
You know I love you so, your body mind and soul
Your taboo

[Verse 2]
My burning love just won't let us be
So we'll try to keep the secrets and live for the ecstasy
This has become a dangerous love [?] always thinking of
Just leave it all to me and never ever stop
This taboo has finally reached the top

[Hook 2]
Please don't ever let me go, your taboo
I can neevr let you go, I love you so
You know I love you so
Your taboo
I can't stay away, can't keep away from your taboo

[Verse 3]
Love and vibrations that you're sending
Powerful energy flows with no ending
You're the dream in my every fantasy
Don't be afraid, just give it all to me

[Hook 2] + [Hook 1]
