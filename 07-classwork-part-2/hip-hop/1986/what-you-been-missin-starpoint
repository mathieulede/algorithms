Yeah, babe
This is really wild

She must have made you cry
Or did your well run dry?
It took you so long to realize
That she was cheating right before your eyes

I kiss and make up for the time we blew
But I'm not so sure about this "Love part II"
See, there's someone else who I think is true
What I'm trying to say is, I've gotten over you

I'm not the jury
And you're not on the stand
But you're guilty
I'm trying to understand

You say
Forget about the past
I won't regret it
We'll make it last
You'll put your money on it
You wanna move in with me
My body needs your kissin'
Still it's hard for me to see
Just what I've been missin'
Baby, I've gotten over you

Let me finish the story:
Thought I found someone (Yes I did, babe)
To fill the space
But I finally realized
She couldn't take your place

You come runnin' back
You have a love attack
You come runnin' back, boy

She took you for a ride
You lost all your pride
Now you come runnin' back, boy

Forget about the past (I'm not the jury)
You won't regret it
This time we'll make it last (And you're not on the stand)
You can put your money on it
Wanna move in with ya (Look, I'm trying to understand)
I'll give you what you've been missin'

Girl
Forget about the past
You won't regret it
We'll make it last
Gotta put your money on it
Wanna move in with ya
Your body needs my kissin'
And honey, when I get ya
I'll give you what you've been missin'

I got what you've been missin'

You come runnin' back
You have a love attack
You come runnin' back, boy

She took you for a ride
You lost all your pride
Now you come runnin' back, boy

Forget about the past, baby
Gotta find a way to make it last
Gotta make it last, baby

What you need
Is what I need

Oh, honey I'm what you need
What you need

You won't regret it, girl
I won't let you down
Forget about the past
You won't regret it
I won't let you down
Won't let you down
I wanna move in with ya
