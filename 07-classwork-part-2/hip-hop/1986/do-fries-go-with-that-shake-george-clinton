Oh, I says the damndest things
Last night when I was running game
I said, "Baby, can I cut your cake?
"Oh, can I have it my way?
Dont I deserve a break today?
Those buns, I like the way you bake."
Running a fever of a hundred and ten

Do fries go with that shake?
Oh, Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake?
Ohhh, Do fries go with that shake?

He says that possesed them free
A quarter pounder just for me
A whopper
That's sure to satisfy

Do fries go with that shake?
Oh, Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake?
Ohhh, Do fries go with that shake?

I'm a fast food junkie
And I need a fix
Without your sugar
I'm gonna be sick
So don't try it

Ooohh, this calorie free and nutra sweet
The love of you has gotten me on a diet

Do fries go with that shake?
Oh, Do fries go with that shake?
Do fries go with that shake?
Ohhh, Do fries go with that shake?

Come on, baby girl
Let me get some fries with that shake
The way that you move
I can tell that ain't a damn things fake
So why don't you just let me get a little something
You know that it's precious? and you know them buns is well done
Let me cool it off by rubbing butter on your muffin
Kicking it up, I'll add some meat to your stuffin
You'll be feeling alright, you can flaunt it all night
Looking way nice with your body all tight
Side to side is the view you got me picturing
Just like a junkie got the (something) fingerlickin
Eggs over easy, you know how I like it
Bacon like (Wha?) so I don't have to bite it
Every last curve got a mark labelled preserved
Brother's waiting in line because they want to get served
Now girl just tell me straight for goodness sake
Uh uh, do fries go with that shake?

Oh, I says the damndest things
Last night when I was running game
I said, "Baby, can I cut your cake?
"Oh, can I have it my way?
Dont I deserve a break today?
