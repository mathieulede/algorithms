Girl I wish that I could spend time with you each and every day
Praying about my love and emotions
That's the thing that's got me open
And I don't know what it takes to let you know you're my girl
To let you know you're my baby
And even when then they say we won't stay around
If they only knew that we were meant to be together
Forever and ever whatever there's no better thing
Me and you girl that's why i write you love letters saying

[Chorus:]
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it girl don't you know i like it
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it girl don't you know i like it

Sometimes i wanna be the one you
Be checking for can i get a second for me
Me and you to be alone tell me if you think it's wrong
Love is nothing but the time it takes
You to say "i'm on your mind"
Let me tell you i'm always there oh yeah
Let's get a little time away go to the movies on a saturday
Meet me at the finish line so i can tell you one more time
Girl you know i'm not scared to let you say that....

[Chorus]

I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it girl don't you know i like it
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it girl don't you know i like it

When i think of you
I think of all the things we could do
And i never wanna let
You go and as long as i can let you know
I hope we stay down forever

I like
Baby baby [x4]
Like it dontcha ya know i like it

[Chorus]

I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it girl don't you know i like it
I like the way you look at me
I like the time we spend baby
I like what we have grown to be
I like it girl don't you know i like it

I like
Baby baby [till fade]
