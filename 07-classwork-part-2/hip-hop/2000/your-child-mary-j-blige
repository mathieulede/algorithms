It's too bad, it's too bad
It's too bad, it's too bad baby
But, I gotta face reality [2x]

[Verse 1]
Today you had a visitor or should i say
An old friend. But, wait a minute
That's not where it ends, no
Is there something that you wanna
Tell me, hmm cause im believing
What your friends say about your
Hidden secretes

[Chorus 1]
Your girlfriend, she wasn't disrespectful
(In fact) She's a hundred percent sure
And how could I argue with her, holding a baby
With eyes like yours

[Chorus 2]
She said it's your child, and it
Really messed me up. How could you deny
Your own flesh and blood. Gotta face
Reality, there can be never be anymore
Us. Won't deny it's hurting me
Yet so precious

[Verse 2]
She said she never wanted to hurt me
And could i understand, she's afraid and lost
She said a real woman wouldn't do this over
The phone. And that you told her about me
After the baby was born

[Chorus 1 & 2]

[Repeat Chorus 2]


Oh the baby looks just like you
How could you deny your own flesh and blood
Your own child. What kind of man are you?

[Chorus 1 & 2]

[Repeat Chorus 2]
