[Verse 1: R.L]
To just act like We never were, to come around
And not show hurt
How dare we greet , by shaking hands
Just months ago I was your man (I was your man)

[R.L & Deborah]
Verbally we agreed it was over, and we were through
I'm trying to compose myself but I just can't get over you girl

[Chorus: R.L.]
We can't be friends
(oh no, oh no, no, no,)
We can't be friends
(Deborah you know I can't go on being just your friend)
We can't be friends
Cause I'm still in love with you
(yeah)

[Verse 2: Deborah Cox]
I went by mothers, saw your car there
To her your still family, and it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on. I tried and I can't do it
Cause I'm still torn

[R.L. & Deborah Cox]
I tried to think of you as just another love (another love)
In past , that didn't last
But it's not that simple baby

[Chorus: Deborah Cox]
We can't be friends
(oh no,no,no)
We can't be friends
If we, if we can't be lovers
We can't be friends
Cause I'm still in love


(D.C & R.L)
You may see me staring or catch me in a daze
May see me hang my head when you come my way
Don't get to close to me and expect me and expect me to behave
I might just still a kiss if you come near my face
What I'm trying to say

[Chorus w/ adlib]
We can't be friends
(Can you look me in the eyes and honestly
Say you don't love me?)
We can't be friends
(Deborah you know, R.L. I know)
We can't be friends
(I'll never, ever find another love like you oh)
I love you too much baby, I love you too much

We can't be friends, I'm still in love with you
