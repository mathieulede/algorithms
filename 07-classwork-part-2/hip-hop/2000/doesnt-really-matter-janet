[Intro]
Doesn't matter, doesn't matter
Doesn't matter at all

[Verse 1]
Doesn't matter what your friends are telling you
Doesn't matter what my family's saying too
It just matters that I'm in love with you
It only matters that you love me too
It doesn't matter if they won't accept you
I'm accepting of you and the things you do
Just as long as it's you. Nobody but you, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
My love for you, unconditional love too
Gotta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
And show you that it..

[Chorus]
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
Cause I'm in love with the inner being, and it
Doesn't really matter what they believe, what matters to me
Is you're in love with me
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
Cause I'm in love with the inner being, and it
Doesn't really matter what they believe, what matters
To me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me

[Post-Chorus]
(You're so kind)
Just what I asked for, you're so loving and kind
(And you're mine)
And I can't believe you're mine

[Verse 2]
Doesn't matter if you're feeling insecure
Doesn't matter if you're feeling so unsure
Cause I'll take away the doubt within your heart
And show that my love will never hurt or harm
Doesn't matter what the pain we go through
Doesn't matter if the money's gone too
Just as long as I'm with you, nobody but you, baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Your love for me, unconditional I see
Gotta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
And show you that it..

[Chorus]
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
Cause I'm in love with the inner being and it
Doesn't really matter what they believe, what matters to me
Is you're in love with me
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
Cause I'm in love with the inner being, and it
Doesn't really matter what they believe, what matters
To me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me

[Post-Chorus]
(You're so kind)
Just what I asked for, you're so loving and kind
(And you're mine)
And I can't believe you're mine

[Breakdown]
Doesn't matter what they say, cause you know
I'm gonna love you anyway
Doesn't matter what they do
Cause my love will always be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
My love for you, unconditional love too
Gotta get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
And show you that my love is true, and it's just for you

[Chorus]
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
Cause I'm in love with the inner being and it
Doesn't really matter what they believe, what matters to me
Is you're in love with me
Doesn't really matter what the eye is seeing
Cause I'm in love with the inner being, and it
Doesn't really matter what they believe, what matters
To me is you're nutty-nutty-nutty for me
Nutty, nutty, nutty my love for you
I can't believe my dreams come true
I've finally found somebody whose heart is true and
Best of all you love me too
And nutty, nutty, nutty my love for you
I can't believe my dreams come true. I've finally found
Somebody whose heart is true and best of all you're
Nutty, nutty, nutty for me

[Outro]
Nutty, nutty, nutty my love for you
I can't believe my dreams come true
I've finally found somebody whose heart is true
And best of all you're
Nutty, nutty, nutty for me
