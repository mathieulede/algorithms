[Intro:]
Yeah, oh
Ah, ah, ah
You know what it is
When your head go back and forth
So So Def
Ha, ha

Chante
2K
(Oooh)
Baby, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1:]
Straight up
I can love you forever, yo
Cause you're the kind of guy I can settle for
I'm not the type to love you
And let you go
Let me know
It's now or it's never, yo

Cause I know them other girls
Try and do you in
But I'm not the average girl
You've been fooling with
Cause those other females are counterfeit
But everything all up here's legit

[Hook:]
It's like this, like this
Like that, baby
Put the other girls way to the back, baby
So you know
I'm not just talking that stuff, baby
Call me up
And let me know what's up, baby
(What's up?)

[Chorus:]
Here's the number to my cell
Now hit me on the hip
Here's the number to my crib where I really live
(Straight up)
I'm not thinking 'bout them other chicks
(Straight up)
They ain't even coming close to this

Here's the number to my job
Or call me in the whip
Now how many chicks you know come with this?
(Straight up)
Cause I'm tryna put you on to this
(Straight up)
And I'm not just talking it

[Verse 2:]
So tell me are you spoken for?
Cause I don't see a ring on your finger, boy
Excuse me
If I'm bold with my question now
But I'm not looking for a hit and run

Don't tell me how those other girls used to be
Just think about you getting used to me
I'm-a show you everything you tryna see
I'm-a put you right where you need to be

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
A lot of girls won't do the things I do
(Do)
A lot of girls won't say the things I say
(Say)
Know that all of this is true
(True)
Talking 'bout me loving you
(Please believe)

Boy, I do
Coming straight up asking me
When you know what I'm about
With a game sweeter than can be
So, baby, won't you check me out?

Oooh, oooh, oooh

Y'all know what it is
When you're head go back and forth
Y'all know what it is
When you're head go back and forth
(Straight up, straight up, what's up?)

[Repeat Chorus x3:]
