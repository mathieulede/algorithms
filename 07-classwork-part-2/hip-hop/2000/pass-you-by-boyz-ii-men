(Verse 1)
She was like nothing I'd ever known
Her eyes shine like diamonds in a field of snow
Man that destiny led her to me
Made her feel that life was now complete

A thousand days have passed
And nights gone by
You can see the glow slowly fading from her eyes
Though she denies her pain and her dismay
Know I said this to her anyway

(Chorus)
Don't have to stay with someone that makes you cry
You'll end up killing all the love you have inside
Can't hope to see the sun
If you don't open your eyes
Girl don't let real love pass you by

Ooh oh no
Ooh don't let real love pass you by

(Verse 2)
I know you are nervous
But take it from me
Cause you deserve so much more than you receive
Listen to your heart and let it show
Don't hold on to your pain
Just let it go, let it go

(Chorus x2)
Don't have to stay with someone
That makes you cry
You'll end up killing all the love you have inside
Can't hope to see the sun
If you don't open your eyes
Girl don't let real love pass you by

(Bridge)
Oh yeah
Girl don't let real love pass you by
You can find a love you need
If you set your heart free
Girl...
Don't have to stay with someone
That makes you cry
Don't be discouraged baby
Don't let real love pass you by

(Chorus x2)
Don't have to stay with someone
That makes you cry
You'll end up killing all the love you have inside
Can't hope to see the sun
If you don't open your eyes
Girl don't let real love pass you by

Don't you let nothing
Don't let no one take you away from love
Don't let real love pass you by
You'll see I know, I know, I know
You'll be alright
Don't let real love pass you by
You just can believe in love, in love, in love, in love
Don't let real love pass you by
Oh yeah
Don't let real love pass you by
Ooh, yeah
Don't let real love pass you by
Don't let, don't let, don't let, don't let
Don't let, don't let, don't let, don't let
Don't let real love pass you by
Oh yeah, oh
Don't let real love pass you by...
