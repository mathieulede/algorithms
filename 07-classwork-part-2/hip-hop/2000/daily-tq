Chorus:
Daily seems like I just can't get ahead
As soon as I get out the bed
It's always something going on to drive me crazy
I try to keep from going insane
But I can't help rackin' my brain
So what am I gonna do
This type of sh** be happening daily

I water my grass
Just to take a load off
There's just so much on my mind
There goes my cell phone
It's always ringing
Can't get no time alone
And it's my girlfriend trippin'
I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
But you making me so damn mad
Cause you don't have to raise your voice
And now we arguing
Why this always happening
I just been busy
I'm doing new album
And it's got me working daily

Chorus

I check my mailbox
SONY is late again, damn
And Monday is a holiday (I can't get paid)
Look at the tv
We just lost Steve Young for two weeks
And the playoffs started last week
And I put 200 on with all my homies
My rover is leaking oil in my driveway
And big daddy just cracked my rim
On the Lex as he drove away
And he got my house keys
And I just lock the door
I look to the lord above
And it's startin to rain and
I swear this sh** be happening daily

Chorus

Ain't got time for nothin' no more
Either in the studio or on tour
Everybody gettin' mad
'Cause I don't get back to 'em fast enough
It is crazy
Might thing i got enough but I want some more
Cause I still ain't got what I came here for
Until I get it
It's a fact that i know sh** gone happening daily

Chorus 2x
