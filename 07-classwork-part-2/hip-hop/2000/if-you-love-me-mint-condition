[Chorus:]
If you love me
Like you say you do
Won’t you show me
Just how much you do?

If you love me unconditionally
Say that you'll always
Always be with me

[Verse 1:]
In my heart
There is a love
That's yearning for you
Let me know if you feel the same
The yearning that I do

All I know is
That I need a love to get what I need
Don’t be afraid or hesitate
I’m trying to make you see how it's gotta be

[Chorus:]
If you love me
(Lady)
Like you say you do
Won’t you show me
(Show me)
Just how much you do?

If you love me
(If you love me)
Unconditionally
Say that you’ll always
Always be with me

[Verse 2:]
All the words
That you didn’t say
Pushed me away from you
Words of love that
I need to hear
To let me know you do

Seems at night
I dry my eyes
For now I have learned
Lonely tears
They fall the same
When love is not returned
Love is not returned

[Chorus:]
If you love me
(If you really love me, oh, oh)
Like you say you do
(Like you say you do)

Won’t you show me
(Won’t you show me, yeah)
Just how much you do
(Oh, oh, oh)

If you love me
(If you love me)
Unconditionally
(Unconditionally)
Say that you’ll always
(Oh)
Always be with me
(Always be with me)

If you love me
(If you love me)
Like you say you do
(Like you say you do)

Won’t you show me
(Why don’t you show me, show me, show me, show me?)
Just how much you do?
(How much you do?)

If you love me
(Love me, love me)
Unconditionally
(Unconditionally)
Say that you’ll always
(Always)
Always be with me

If you love me
(Like you say)
Like you say you do
(Every little thing that you say)
Won’t you show me
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just how much you do?
(Ooh, how much you do?)

If you love me
(I’ve got what you want and you’ve got what I want)
Unconditionally
(Unconditionally)
Say that you’ll always
(Always)
Always be with me
(Always be with me)

La, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da
Da, da, da
Hey, yeah
