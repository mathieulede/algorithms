C'mon, c'mon
Now, get 'em up, get 'em up, what?
Get 'em up, get 'em up, what?
Get 'em up, get 'em up, what?
What's with the melodrama?
Fella's wanna hover in my cypher like a helicopter
Like it's a special honor, the stealth bomba, gem droppa
Make the ghetto holla, intercontinental
Takin' you high like sky divers
When we spark with live wires
Original, cavemen quest for my fire
Express my desire to drop this new shit
These record executives keep tellin' me y'all stupid
Now if they right, shut the fuck up
Revolutionaries, throw your guns up
Whether you a Bourgeois broad who actin' stuck up
Or some ignorant thug motherfucker shootin' the club up
We gonna make y'all feel this, break y'all spirit
If y'all fake that realness, word, we bringin' it
Ringin' it in from the new millennium to way after that
I call these cats Reynolds 'cuz they plastic wrap
Kill all the yappin', let's make it happen
You cats ain't real, y'all just a re-enactment
Better yet, dramatization
Soon as the director say, â€œActionâ€, you start fakin'
I start breakin'
The whole joint start shakin'
This ain't the time or place for you to prove somethin'
Cut the stargazin', yo, move somethin'
Move somethin', move somethin'
Move somethin', move somethin'
To be continued
Let's see what's next up on the menu, run up in you
Lyrics that be fuckin' with you
In the mental, pick any mental, instru, funda, detri
Extra, extra large like the borough of Brooklyn
The residential, existentialist, specialist
Like Sly Stone wit my poem an' fly song
Ride along with cats who live great an' die strong, word
We gonna rock till nothin' else matters
Y'all catch bodies, we catch excellent cadavers
Your next of kin an' shatter stories splattered in the tabloids
Erase your trace like your cotton mouth an' we peppermint altoids
Step in the high, reppin' the spot called Flatbush
Whether rappers or actors, you still feel the gat bust
The abstract then becomes the reality
Alcoholics like to call it the moment of clarity
Kill all the yappin', let's make it happen
You cats ain't real, y'all just a re-enactment
Better yet, dramatization
Soon as the director say, â€œActionâ€, you start fakin'
I start breakin'
The whole joint start shakin'
This ain't the time or place for you to prove somethin'
Cut the stargazin', yo, move somethin'
Move somethin', move somethin'
Move somethin', move somethin'
Word, Flatbush, Brownsville
[Incomprehensible] niggas, move somethin'
CHI and West Side niggas, move somethin'
Cincinatti in the house, you got to move somethin'
My niggas in the dirty South got to move somethin'
The South Bronx, 125, nigga, move somethin'
[Incomprehensible] make it live, nigga, move somethin'
Miami all the way to Philly got to move somethin'
Chicago an' the Brick City got to move somethin'
My soul rebels in the Brook' got to move somethin'
