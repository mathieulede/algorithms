[Intro]
Hey Deb
Uh huh
Thank you for being woman enough to come
Whitney, what's this about?
I know he's leaving me for you
Who said that, who told you that is true?
What is he telling you?
Could it be the same things that he told me?
He told me that he loved me

[Verse 1]
I heard that
He told me I was beautiful
How did you know? How did you know?
Cause I've played that scene before

[Pre-Chorus]
This is a retake of my life
I was his star for many nights
Now the roles have changed
And you're the leading lady in his life

[Chorus]
Lights, camera, now you're on
Just remember you've been warned
Enjoy it now cause it won't last
Same script, different cast

[Verse 2]
What you're saying could be true
But how can I take advice from you?
I'm not hating but I wish the one before me
Would have warned me too, babe

[Bridge]
Don't say no more la la la la la la la la la
Uncover you're ears girl
I'm not listening la la la la la la la la la
But I know you hear me
Maybe my reasons are wrong, but I know that you believe me

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's your fault, you didn't love him enough
That's the problem I loved him too much
And when you love him, he becomes unattracted to you
Oh no, he's changing now he'll prove you wrong
No you won't
So go away, leave us the hell alone cause he loves me
He'll hurt you
He'll stay with me
He'll leave you for sure, for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
