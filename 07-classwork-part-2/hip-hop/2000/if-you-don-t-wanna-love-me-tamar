Stopped by to see you, just the other day
And i wanna say, that i finally realize
That without love dont mean a thing
Its so hard for me to see that you meant everything to me
But i guess i gotta move on
Even though it hurts i gotta be strong

(Chorus)
If you dont wanna love me, dont love me, dont wanna touch me, dont touch me
Cuz i dont want you to do anything that you dont wanna do
If you dont wanna miss me, dont miss me, dont wanna kiss me, dont kiss me
Cause i dont want you to do anything that you dont wanna do

(Verse 2)
Who would have known, all the nights that you were hanging late
All alone I lay awake in my bed
Though i never put food on your plate
How it feels to believe
That you never ever loved me
I got to move on, our love is gone
And this house is not a home

(Chorus)
You can be lonely, I dont even care
But do you have to think that you'd always be there
Say you'd be right there, so if you...

(Chorus x 3)
