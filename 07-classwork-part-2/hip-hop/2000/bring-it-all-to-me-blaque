[Verse 1: Shamari]
There you are
Looking as fine as can be
In your fancy car
I can see you looking at me

What you wanna do?
Are you just gonna sit there and stare?
Baby, talk to me
Tell me what's on your mind
Baby, oh

[Chorus:]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(bring it all)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings(baby I don't need, no)

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(bring it all)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy(hooooo)

[J.C. Chasez]
Baby, what's the deal?
Would I be too forward if
I told you how I feel
That's just the way I do my thing
I'm so for real

Are you feeling my Timb's?
My baggy jeans?
My thug appeal?
Do you like it when a man can keep it real?
Oh

[Chorus:]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(bring it all,bring it all)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings(diamond rings)

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy

Oh, baby

[Shamari]
Oh
I'll put my pride to the side
Just to tell you how good
You make me feel inside

[J.C. Chasez]
There's not a single question
That we can't make this right
Cause it's you I need
Every day and night

[J.C. Chasez & Shamari]
Oh ho ho
Baby, yeah

[Chorus:]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(bring it all, bring it all)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings(no I don't)

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(bring it all)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy(hooooo)

[Chorus:]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(yeah)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings(oohhhhhh)

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(bring it all)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy(oohhhh)

[Chorus:]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(yeah)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings(oohhhhhh)

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(bring it all)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy(oohhhh)

[Chorus:]
Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(yeah)
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings(oohhhhhh)

Oh, baby
Bring it all to me(bring it all)
Gimme your time, your love, your space, your energy(oohhhh)
