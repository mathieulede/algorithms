Tell me what the deal is
What's goin on
Why ya peeps don't like me
Said I ain't the one
They said I live a thug life
Jitterbug to the bone
How they gon talk about me
Betta leave me alone
It drives me crazy
Cause they know that you're my baby
Tryna make me ghost like Swayze
But you'll 4ever be my lady

Chorus:
I don't care what ya momma say
What ya brother say
What ya father say
I'm gonna love you neway

I dont care what your mamma say
Or what you sister say
Or what you girlfriends say
Im gonna love ya

Ya peeps say they seen me
Hangin out in the streets
Swingin wit the project ladies
And the ghetto freaks
How they gonna talk bad bout my family
Jojo, Ray-ray, kesha, and my cousin malik
I'm there when u holla
Whatever you need you gotta
Sure nuff treat you proper
Tryna be your baby dada

I don't care what ya momma say
What ya brother say
What ya father say
I'm gonna love you neway

(Bridge)
I don't care what ya momma say
What ya brother say
What ya father say
I'm gonna love you neway
