VERSE: 1
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
How could we be broken, broken apart
Let's not be over, let's make it right
Don't take me through this
Another sleepless night
'Cause it's killin' me
That suddenly I find myself alone
I'll try to love you better baby
Won't you come on come on back home

CHORUS:
I'M NOT USED TO WAKIN' UP AND BEING BY MYSELF
I'M NOT USED TO COMING HOME FROM WORK AND NO ONE'S THERE
I'M NOT USED TO MISSIN' ANYONE
I'M NOT USED TO GETTING NO LOVE
I'M NOT USED TO HAVIN' SOMEONE NEVER TOUCHIN' ME
I'M NOT USED TO THIS I WANT IT HOW IT USED TO BE
I'M NOT USED TO MISSIN' ANYONE
I'M NOT USE TO GETTING NO LOVE

VERSE: 2
We've had our problems
But that's not so strange
Baby we can solve them
I'll show you I've changed yeah
You're all I've wanted baby
You've been there for me
I'm beggin' 'cause I love you baby
I'm beggin' on my kness
And it's killin' me that suddenly I find myself alone
I know I love you better baby won't you come back home

I'M NOT USED TO WAKIN' UP AND BEING BY MYSELF
I'M NOT USED TO COMING HOME FROM WORK AND NO ONE'S THERE
I'M NOT USED TO MISSIN' ANYONE
I'M NOT USED TO GETTING NO LOVE
I'M NOT USED TO HAVIN' SOMEONE NEVER TOUCHIN' ME
I'M NOT USED TO THIS I WANT IT HOW IT USED TO BE
I'M NOT USED TO MISSIN' ANYONE
I'M NOT USE TO GETTING NO LOVE

I'd rather die
Then live my life
I can't accept the thought of you
Being loved by someone, someone else
'Cause there's no love
Like your love
Oh I promise I'll be true to you
For the rest, for the rest of my life

I'M NOT USED TO WAKIN' UP AND BEING BY MYSELF
I'M NOT USED TO COMING HOME FROM WORK AND NO ONE'S THERE
I'M NOT USED TO MISSIN' ANYONE
I'M NOT USED TO GETTING NO LOVE
I'M NOT USED TO HAVIN' SOMEONE NEVER TOUCHIN' ME
I'M NOT USED TO THIS I WANT IT HOW IT USED TO BE
I'M NOT USED TO MISSIN' ANYONE
I'M NOT USE TO GETTING NO LOVE
