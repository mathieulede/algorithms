(Intro):
Darkchild, oh yeah
Toni Braxton, oh
Ha-ha, uh-huh
Yeah, uh, uh
Darkchild yeah

[Verse 1-Toni Braxton]
Listen girl
Who do you think I am
Don't you know that he was my man
But I chose to let him go
So why do you act like I still care about him
Looking at me like I'm hurt
When I'm the one who said I didn't want it to work
Don't you forget I had him first

[Pre-Hook-Toni Braxton, Nora Payne, Charlotte Gibson and Darkchild]
What you thinkin'
Stop playing me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

[Hook-Toni Braxton, Nora Payne, Charlotte Gibson and Darkchild]
What are you thinking
Did you know about us back them
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay with me
He wasn't man enough for me

[Verse 2-Toni Braxton]
Listen girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not then why don't you ask him?
Then maybe you can be more into him
Instead of worrying about me
And hopefully you won't find
All the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

[Pre-Hook-Toni Braxton, Nora Payne, Charlotte Gibson and Darkchild]
What you thinkin'
Stop playing me
He wasn't man enough for me
If you don't know now here's your chance
I've already had your man
Do you wonder just where he's been, yeah
Not be worried about him
Now it's time you know the truth
I think he's just the man for you

[Hook-Toni Braxton, Nora Payne, Charlotte Gibson and Darkchild]
What are you thinking
Did you know about us back them
Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend
I'm not thinking 'bout him
But you married him
Do you know I made him leave
Do you know he begged to stay with me
He wasn't man enough for me

[Bridge-Toni Braxton]
Oh yeah
So many reasons why our love is through, yeah
What makes you think he'll be good to you, no
It makes no sense cause he will never change
Girl you better recognize the game, oh yeah
