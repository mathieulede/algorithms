Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man

Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Get your hands off my man

He told your ass not once but twice
You should have took his advice and left the man alone
You still drive by here every night
Youre not wrapped too tight
You let your mind explode

You had (you had) your chance (your chance)
And you lost a good man (good man)
I know (I know) its sad (its sad)
Thinkin bout what you had
If you (if you) was smart (was smart)
Keep that ass out of my car
Next time(next time) see me (see me)
I won't be a lady no,no

Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my man
Don't mess with my boy
Keep your hands off my man

You bitched at him all night all day
You constantly complained till you drove the man away
Always saying something said he wasn't good for nothing
So tell me why the hell you stalking
Youre just pissed now get to walking

You had (you had) your chance (your chance)
And you lost a good man (good man)
I know (I know) its sad (its sad)
Thinking 'bout what you had
If you (if you) was smart(was smart)
Keep that ass out of my car
Next time (next time) see me (see me)
I won't be a lady no,no

Don't mess with my man
