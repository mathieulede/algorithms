Tell my why did you do this to me
After we made plans for a family
And you swear you would bare my child
All the while you were out running wild
With yo' friends
Spendin' all my ends
And I caught you screamin' Ooo Ahh with him
I think it's time I let you know you can go
There's the do' (door)

You're nothing but
A liar, a cheater, a deciever, heart breaker
And I won't let you back in my life
So I'm takin
The house, the cars, the kids, and the dog
I want it all
You're nothing but
A liar, a cheater, a deciever, heart breaker
And I won't let you back in my life
So I'm takin
The house, the cars, the kids, and the dog
I want it all
You're nothing but

Seven years I have lived this lie
When inside you made me cry
Through it all I still remained
Till' you messed up and called me his name
Please don't explain
You go your way
And I'll maintain
Don't worry the kids are okay
Just remember

You're nothing but
A liar, a cheater, a deciever, heart breaker
And I won't let you back in my life
So I'm takin
The house, the cars, the kids, and the dog
I want it all
You're nothing but
A liar, a cheater, a deciever, heart breaker
And I won't let you back in my life
So I'm takin
The house, the cars, the kids, and the dog
I want it all
You're nothing but

Look at you now
Cause your down and out, down and out
And you needin' me to keep you strong, keep you strong

You're nothing but
A liar, a cheater, a deciever, heart breaker
And I won't let you back in my life
So I'm takin
The house, the cars, the kids, and the dog
I want it all
You're nothing but
A liar, a cheater, a deciever, heart breaker
And I won't let you back in my life
So I'm takin
The house, the cars, the kids, and the dog
I want it all
You're nothing but

You're nothing but
A liar, a cheater, a deciever, heart breaker
And I won't let you back in my life
So I'm takin
The house, the cars, the kids, and the dog
I want it all
You're nothing but
A liar, a cheater, a deciever, heart breaker
And I won't let you back in my life
So I'm takin
The house, the cars, the kids, and the dog
I want it all
You're nothing but
