Storming outside, rain
She keeps me home
Quiet conversation makes me warm
So

1 - Summer rain
Whispers me to sleep
And wakes me up again
Sometimes I swear I hear her call my name
To wash away the pain
My summer rain

In the middle of the night when I'm alone
I feel her kisses on me even when she's gone
Can't wait 'till she gets home

Repeat 1

I don't mind if it rains forever
Let it rain, rain, let it rain
I said I don't mind if it rains forever
Let it rain, rain, let it rain

2 So go ahead and make it rain
You bring the sunshine back again
So go ahead and make it rain
Your tender touches wash away my rain

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Repeat 2
Repeat 2

Repeat 1 until fade
