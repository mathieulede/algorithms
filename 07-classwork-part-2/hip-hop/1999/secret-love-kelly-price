I got a secret in my heart
And baby it's tearin' me apart
'Cuz I want the world to understand
That I love you and you are my man
Baby we know that we belong
A love that is real just can't be wrong
Can't keep it inside for very long
This love is too strong
So ready or not here I come
(Oh come on)
I got a secret that I want you to know
Baby yeah, I can't hide what I feel inside
Boy it's killing me baby
So why can't they see that I
I can't hide what I feel inside
Everyone should know
So just let it show baby
Boy I feel it's time to let it go
We stayed on the hush, we kept it low
But I need to let my feelin's show
I can't take it no more
So ready or not here I come
I got a secret that I want you to know
Baby, baby I can't hide what I feel inside
Boy it's killing me baby

Oh baby, I can't keep it secret
I must release this, we can't keep it a secret
Fuckin' hush hush, need you in my life to complete it
Cuz ain't nobody like us together, let's grow old together
We never fold through whatever we roll, believe it
When you get mad I'm heated I want the world to see it
When you happy my purpose never defeated
You got me, walkin' round, helpless, with no hope
I'm high off you selfish with mah dough
Lord pictured a vision of me and you
It'll never be anotha lova like boo boo, let's show 'em
Ignore whatchya home boyz say, they ain't knowin'
How we be keepin' it quiet long enough
What I feel inside strong enough to bust
Open the heart of tha hardest thug
Hop on this woodie when he need love
Can't hide, they see me shine when I ride this
Blow they inquirin' minds, it's you and I boy
I can't hide what I feel inside
Boy it's killing me baby
So why can't they see that I
I can't hide what I feel inside
Everyone should know
So just let it show baby
I can't hide what I feel inside
