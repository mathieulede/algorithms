Hey sexy
There's something that I want from you
Don't front, you know what it is
Come here
I can't get enough of your thing
I can't get enough of your thing
I can't get enough of your thing
I can't get enough of your thing
Oh oh oh, it's been an hour and three seconds
Since I had you naked
And I'm feeling like its nicotine
And I only wish that I could keep my cool
You got me being a fool
And I want another piece of you
I'm lonely like in solitaire
And I wish I had you here
And I'll push you down and climb on top of you
The more that your away
The more I wish you stay
And I'm gonna have my way with you
And there is no way that I'll stop wanting you
Now tell me if its hard, for you to give it up
Is it wrong, for me to want your love
Is it crazy, that I want you so bad
Uh, like I do
And there is no way that I'll stop loving you

[Chorus]
I can't get enough of your thing
(the way you hold me)
I can't get enough of your thing
(the way you touch me)
I can't get enough of your thing
(whats a girl to do)
I can't get enough of your thing
(with a man like you)

Oh oh oh, everybody says I'm crazy
They say you got me open
Like a twenty four hour liquor store
You never keep your baby running
You always keep me cumming
And now in feeling for some more
Come close to me
Baby be strong
Don't ever stop
Keep holding on
Everybody's got their own way of living
And I gotta be down with the way I'm feelin'
And there is no way that I'll stop wanting you
Now tell me is if its hard, for you to give it up
And is it wrong, for me to want your love
And is it crazy, that I want you so bad
Uh, like I do
And there is no way that I'll stop loving you

[Chorus:Repeat x2]
