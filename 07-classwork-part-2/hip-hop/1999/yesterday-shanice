[Verse 1:]
I know
I shouldn't walk out this way
Sorry, but my feelings have changed
I would only hurt you more
If I stayed

So I can't go on pretending
That I feel like I did yesterday
So

[Chorus:]
I can't stay
And keep living this lie
I finally found the strength to say goodbye

I'm on my way
Nothing can change my mind
I'm leaving behind what we had
Yesterday

[Verse 2:]
Know this
It's not about somebody else
It's not you
I just need some time by myself

Though it hurts me to
See you go through this pain
Still I can't go on believing
That I feel like I did yesterday
So

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Throughout this time
I've realized
Been holding this in far too long
Now I have to be strong

Can't turn back
I've been there for you
And now I must do
What I should have
Yesterday

[Repeat Chorus:]
