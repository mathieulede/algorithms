[Verse 1]
Almost made you love me, almost made you cry
Almost made you happy, baby didn't I, didn't I?
You almost had me thinking you were turned around
But everybody knows, almost doesn't count

[Verse 2]
Almost heard you saying you were finally free
What was always missing for you, babe, you found it in me
But, you can't get to heaven half off the ground
Everybody knows, almost doesn't count

[Hook]
I can't keep on loving you one foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on trying if you're looking for more, than all that
I can give you than what you came here for

[Verse 3]
Gonna find me somebody not afraid to let go
Want a no doubt, be there kind of man. You came real close
But every time you built me up, you only let me down
And everybody knows, almost doesn't count

Hey, hey (everybody knows)
Hey, hey hey
I can't keep on baby, can't keep on trying
Everybody knows, almost doesn't count

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Maybe you'll be sorry. Maybe you'll be cold
Maybe you'll come running back babe, from the cruel, cruel world
Almost convince me you're gonna stick around
But everybody know, almost doesn't count
So maybe I'll be here, maybe I'll see you around
That's the way it goes, almost doesn't count
