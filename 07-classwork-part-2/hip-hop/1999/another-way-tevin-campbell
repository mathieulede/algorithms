[Verse 1:]
Early in the morning
'Round 3:00 A.M
Lying with a girl named Kim

With a glass of gin
Sipping on it
About to hit the skins
Now I'm all in

Telephone rang
Was a girl named Jane
From around the way
How could I forget

Damn
Am I caught?
"Is it time to quit?"
Runnin' through my head

[Chorus:]
I ain't trying to run around no more
Sick and tired of losing track of scores
Every time I turn around
The same old game
Another day

Thinking I just wanna settle down
Tired of living foul
It's over now
Said to myself
There's gotta be another way

[Verse 2:]
Later in the day
Next case
Was a girl named Trace

Draped in lace
Pink negligee
Spreading her legs
Drinking Perguoet
Calling my name

Telephone rang
She said that it was a friend on the other end
Sounding masculine
Couldn't believe
How could I pretend
Didn't hurt me

Finally, I can see
There's another life for me
I don't wanna live this way
I feel it's time I made a change

I believe I can be a better man
And I don't need
Every woman in the world
I gotta find myself a girl

[Repeat Chorus:]
