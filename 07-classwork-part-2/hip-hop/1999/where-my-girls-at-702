[Verse 1: Kameelah]
See, he's my property and any girl that touch
I might just call your bluff 'cause I don't give a
Who are you to call my cell?
Oh, I'm gonna wish you well
'Cause any girl that tried has failed but

[Chorus]
Where my girls at? From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that? Put one hand up
Can you repeat that? Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that, so, don't play yourself

[Verse 2: Kameelah]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't you violate me
'Cause I'ma make you hate me
If you decide to mess with mine
Chop you down to size
Make you realise
You done messed up this time

[Chorus]
Where my girls at? From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that? Put one hand up
Can you repeat that? Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that, so, don't play yourself

[Bridge]
You must learn the rules
Don't come close to
Anything that belongs to me
He is mine
My property
So you must leave

[Chorus]
Where my girls at? From the front to back
Well, is you feelin' that? Put one hand up
Can you repeat that? Tryna take my man
See, I don't need that, so, don't play yourself
