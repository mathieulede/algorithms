Don't wanna make a scene
I really don't care if people stare at us
Sometimes I think I'm dreamin'
I pinch myself just to see if I'm awake or not
Is it real what I feel?
Could it be you and me 'til the end of time
Never part, take my heart, hold it tight
It's true love you know I gotta be
I gotta be the one you touch
Baby, I gotta be the one you love
(I'm telling you that)
I gotta be the one you feel
And I gotta be the one to fill your life with sunshine
I gotta be the one you know
'Cause I will always love you so
(I'm loving you, girl)
I gotta be the one you need
I'm just telling you that I gotta be
Picture you and me
Starting a life together, we could be
We'll take this vow to love one another
Make this thing a reality, oh
I gotta be the one you touch
Baby, I gotta be the one you love
(I'm telling you that)
I gotta be the one you feel
And I gotta be the one to fill your life with sunshine
I gotta be the one you know
'Cause I will always love you so
(I'm loving you, girl)
I gotta be the one you need
I'm just telling you that I gotta be
Picture you and me
Starting a life together, we could be
We'll take this vow to love one another
Make this thing a reality, oh
You make me whole, you make me right
Don't ever wanna think about you leaving my life
You make me whole, you make me right
Don't ever wanna think about you leaving my life
You make me whole, you make me right
Don't ever wanna think about you leaving my life
