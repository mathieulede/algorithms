[Verse 1]
How could you lie to me
After all that we've been through
Its just so sad to see
Me in love with you, I gave you all of me
But it still wasn't enough for you
Is this how loves suppose to be
Now i'm trying to get over you

[Chorus]
You ain't missin' me at all
You won't pick up the phone and call
You don't know me, like you used to
Tell me what is going on
You got me standing here alone
You don't know me, like you used to

[Verse 2]
Remember what you said
When you stepped up on the scene
You got into my head
Had me stressin' like a fiend
No I just can't forget
How you put that thing on me
I wish we never met
This way I wouldn't be lonely

[Chorus]x2

[Break]
You don't know me
Know me, like you used to
You don't know me
Know me, like you used to

[Chorus]x2

[Break during Chorus]
