Hmmm
Loving you is wonderful
Something like a miracle
Rest assured I feel the same way you do
Meeting you, it isn't hard
With you, I can let down my guard
Stay secure that's all I'm asking from you
(Stay secure)

I wish I had words to tell (I wish)
This feeling that I know so well
But I don't, I don't
(chrous)
I - All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)

I've always been curious
Meeting someone serious
Looking for someone who loves like me
But the day I stopped my search
It seemed that you were put on Earth
To show me everything I could not see

I wish I could find a way
To tell you how I felt that day
But I can't (I just can't)
I can't

I've always been curious
Meeting someone serious
Looking for someone who loves like me
But the day I stopped my search
It seemed that you were put on Earth
To show me everything I could not see

I've always been curious
Meeting someone serious
Looking for someone who loves like me

It seemed that you were put on Earth
To show me everything I could not see

Hmmm, oh
Knowing him, loving him
Showing him that I'm all him
Living and forgiving and
I would do it all again
Genuine, seraphim
Sweeter than cinamon
Heaven-sent gentleman
Sent him here for loving him
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh

I've always been curious
Meeting someone serious
Looking for someone who loves like me
But the day I stopped my search
It seemed that you were put on Earth
To show me everything I could not see

I've always been curious

He's all that I'll ever need
He's got a hold on me
I love you
Oh I don't wanna live without you
You're all that I can say, hey
Loving you is wonderful
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
(Do do, do do, do do, doo)
All that I can say
