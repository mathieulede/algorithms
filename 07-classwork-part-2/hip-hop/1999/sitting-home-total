[Chorus]
Sittin home waitin for you
'Cause staring at these walls is all I do
I try my best to be good to you
But your never around when Im in the mood

[Verse 1]
Im gettin tired being tired your ways
You haven't come home or even call me today
You dont know the pain when Im being alone
Im callin out your name when your not even home

[Bridge]
Cause I need you with me babe
Can't see you leaving me babe
Cause I dont know no other road I would go
And I hope your feelings change come bring your lovin back to me
So I can give you what you need and much more
Oh, until then...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
All my friends think that I am a fool
And since you have been gone Ive been thinkin so too
Just tell me what is it and what you feel I do wrong
We should stay together cause our love is so strong

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
By myself all day long
These feeling that I feel for you feel so strong
By myself all day long
These feeling that I feel for you since you been gone

Chorus
