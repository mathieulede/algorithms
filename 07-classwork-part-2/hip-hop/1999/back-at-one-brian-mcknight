[Verse 1]
It's undeniable
That we should be together
It's unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know, if you don't know just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real
If all things in time, time will reveal
Yeah

[Hook]
One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl it's plain to see
That your the only one for me

Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start Back at One
Yeah (yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's so incredible the way things work themselves out
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would of made it very far
Cause you know that you've got the keys to my heart

Cause

[Hook]
One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl it's plain to see
That your the only one for me

Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start Back at One

[Verse 3]
Say farewell to the dark of night I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child
Whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life
Into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line just in the Nick of Time

[Hook]
One, you're like a dream come true
Two, just wanna be with you
Three, girl it's plain to see
That your the only one for me

Four, repeat steps one through three
Five, make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I start Back at One
