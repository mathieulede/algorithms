[Verse 1: Eric Benét]
(hmm)
It's not your situation
I just need contemplation over you (over you)
I'm not so systematic
It's just that I'm an addict for your love, yeah (oh)

[Hook: Eric Benét]
I'm the only one that holds you (hmm)
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl (never should have told you)
I'm the only one that holds you (no, no)
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world  (hmm)

[Verse 2: Eric Benét]
Just think how long I've known you
It's wrong for me to own you
Lock and key (lock and key)
It's really not confusing
I'm just the young illusion
Can't you see? oh yeah

I'm the only one that holds you no, no
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl (never should have told me)
I'm the only one that holds you (yeah)
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world
No no no
