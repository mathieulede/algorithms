[Verse 1]
I done been around the world and everywhere be the same song
Niggas struggle daily, gotta survive, it's worldwide
Even niggas in Paris in London be hustling
Doing whatever to get the money
Looking at the whole big wide world ??? mighty thugs ???
But you gotta keep it real if you wanna make it, do ???
And make a ??? kids
Gotta handle your business
Gotta get in it to win it
And then you gotta get up out of there
And that's real, really, my thugs feel me
Put your fists up in the air, yeah
Nigga coming to the war and I'm a meet you niggas there
Ready to rumble, and I swear, we're coming from everywhere
Where my thugs at, where they at, fuck that
Nigga let's do in the enemy now
Terminate, eliminate 'em
I'm taking out the frustration on the world
Get 'em back for the playa nation
So come on we gotta roll, and wouldn't you know
They ain't ready for the war, pop the ??? get arrested
To the po-po, you in total control
Make em feel the pain in two-double-oh-oh
It's the end of the road, so what you gon' do
I'm a ride till we die if you want to
Would all them real soldiers come on move
Get your suits on, boots on, keep trooping on
T-H-U-G, U-G, that's what we be, across the nation
Pump your fists and get ready for this occasion
Think you'd better fade on, Bone wanna see victory
Y'all niggas better roll with this
Cause we splitting em, fuck that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Be a thug, if you wanna be a thug, be a thug if you got to
Throw it up, keep it in the air, scream it out
Thug, thug, thug, thug, thugging till the day I die
When I'm high if you look into my eyes, you'll truly find
No kind like I, Gemini and it controls both sides
My Lordy Lord, maintaing hard cause I'm a soldier at war
Steady running with the weapons cause it still ain't getting better
Figured it out, it's all real, and if it ain't then it ain't right
Come on, if you wanna feel the thug love
And it's real, we got the real thing baby
Hot Heat to burn you, learn you
Stay out of it if it don't concern you
You don't really wanna get involved with the murder
But shit, if you want it, you got it, we bring it, it don't stop
We gon' pop shots still to the double Glock-Glock
Never takin' no shorts, no losses man
Yes, these days it's still the same like
Gotta make that money, mayn
Bang, gotta get down for my thang, and I do it so smooth
When I'm stalkin' gatt fools, walkin jack moves
And I'm on the run widda me shotgun, bottom line it's on
Ya'll can't fuck with the thuggish ruggish, ruggish
Bone, bone, bone, bone, that's thug mentality
