There's no hiding place
When someone has hurt you
It's written on your face
And it reads
Broken spirits
Lost and confused
Empty, scared
Used and abused
A fool, ooooooh
Ain't it funny the way you feel
Show's on your face
And the smile u used 2 wear
Seems a little bit out of place
Just hold on
In time it gets a little better

My sunshine has come
And i'm all dried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud(repeat)

So, u want 2 leave
2 u I shall give
All the space that u've requested
Hope you don't live to regret it
So u say ur in ur prime
Baby don't waste your time
Remember my love
It's only a thin line

My sunshine has come
And i'm all dried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud (repeat)

Spring has come
And winter's gone my way
Don't look around for me child I'll
(I'll be long gone, long gone, long gone)
Not afraid
Because the seasons have changed
I'm gonna count my blessings
And just follow the sun

My sunshine has come
And i'm all dried out
And there's no more rain in this cloud

You brought me down
You brought me way down
You.. you... you brought me down
What goes around
Comes around
What goes up
Must come down
