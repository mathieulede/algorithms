[Verse 1]
Yesterday was not just another day
Not like before
Yesterday I saw your smiling  face
Love walked through my door

[Bridge]
One precious moment
Changed my life
One tender kiss
Made everything right
One touch from you
And this world was mine
It was in your arms where I found forever

[Chorus]
Cried my first tears of joy last night
Heaven shined a light
All my dreams came true
My first night with you

[Verse 2]
I felt the sun
Shine so bright on me
Chased the rain from my heart
Through the storm
Through the darkest night
I found my brightest star

[Bridge + Chorus]

One touch from you
And this world was mine
It was in your arms babe
Where I found forever and ever

Cried my first tears of joy, last night
Heaven shined a light [Heaven shined a light]
All my dreams came true
My first night with you
