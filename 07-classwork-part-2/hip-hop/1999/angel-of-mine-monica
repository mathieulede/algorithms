[Verse 1]
When I first saw you
I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that
I would never find
Angel of mine
I look at you
Looking at me
Now I know why they say
The best things are free
I'm gonna love you, boy
You are so fine
Angel of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
How you changed my world
You'll never know
I'm different now
You helped me grow

[Chorus]
You came into my life
Sent from above
When I lost all hope
You showed me love
I'm checking for you, boy
You're right on time
Angel of mine

[Verse 2]
Nothing means more to me
Than what we share
No one in this whole world can ever compare
Last night
The way you moved is still on my mind
Angel of mine

[Pre-Chorus]
What you mean to me
You'll never know
Deep inside
I need to show

[Chorus]
You came into my life
Sent from above (sent from above)
When I lost all hope
You showed me love
(Boy, you showed me love)
I'm checking for you, boy
You're right on time (right on time)
Angel of mine
(Angel of mine)

[Bridge]
I never knew I could feel each moment
As if it were new
Every breath that I take
The love that we make
I only share it with you
(You, you, you, you)

When I first saw you
I already knew
There was something inside of you
Something I thought that
I would never find
Angel of mine

[Chorus]
You came into my life
Sent from above
(Came into my life, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I lost all hope
You showed me love
(Boy, you showed me love, uh huh)
I'm checking for you, boy
You're right on time
(But boy, you're right on time)
Angel of Mine (angel of mine, oh, mine)

How you changed my world
You'll never know
I'm different now
You helped me grow

I look at you
Looking at me
Now I know why they say
The best things are free

I'm checking for you, boy
You're right on time
Angel of mine
