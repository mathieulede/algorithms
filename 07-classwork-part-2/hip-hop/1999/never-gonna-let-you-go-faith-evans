If I had one wish boy
I'd wish you next to me
And it could be in summer, fall, or spring, boy
Cause you make my heart sing

I wanna give my heart, my soul, my love to you, oh baby, yeah
Cause every day I'm not with you, I'm missing you like crazy

I need for you to love me, (love me)
Hold me, (hold me)
Touch me, (touch me)
Down deep in my soul, I'll never let it go
Cause the love we share; no one compares to you
I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)
Cause I really love you so
Oh I, I'll never let you go. Oh, no. No no no no

If you must know the truth boy, I'm nothing without you
It's funny how I know what people mean, boy
When it's too good to be true
Because you give me joy, good love, good times
Such happiness, oh yeah
And every day I thank the Lord for you
I feel so blessed

I need for you to love me, (love me)
Hold me, (hold me)
Touch me
Down deep in my soul, never let it go
Cause the love we share; no one compares to you
I'll never let you go (I'll never let you go)
Cause I really love you so
Oh I, I'll never let you go. Oh, no. No no no no

If you only knew what you really do ain't never have no one
That does it quite
Like you do
You could spend half a lifetime tryin to find one like you
That's why I am so glad I found you baby
I wished upon a star and then it came true

DARLIN!!
I need for you to love me. (love me)
Hold me, (hold me)
Touch me, (touch me)
Down deep in my soul, I'll never let it go
Cause the love we share; no one compares to you
I'll never let you go. Cause I really love you so
No I, I'll never let you go. No no. Oooohh
