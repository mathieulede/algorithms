Since you left me, my life ain't been the same
I'm useless without your love
I'm calling, crying out your name
When I look around
Your love is nowhere to be found
Please come back to me
You know you're my everything
Who will love me?
Who will care?
Who will be there when I need someone for me?
Who will be there to dry my eyes when I go down on my knees?
I need you to say

Chorus
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
You know I'm waiting
You know I'll never leave
Whatever it takes
Whatever's at stake
Just know I love you
And that I'll be right here
And no matter what it takes
I'll be waiting here for you always

Goodbye is such a hard thing to say
When you walk out on all
When you're my everything
And who will stay and care for me
When you're gone I'll be all alone
Who will go and comfort me
And fulfill my needs
Who will love me?
Who will care?
Who will be there when I need someone for me?
Who will be there to dry my eyes when I go down on my knees?
I need you to say

Chorus

All my life I've waited for someone like you
So please don't say it's over
Don't tell me--this just can't be true
Please don't leave me
Don't walk away
You know your love is something I can't do without
So whatever it takes or how my heart aches
You know I'll always be around

Chorus
