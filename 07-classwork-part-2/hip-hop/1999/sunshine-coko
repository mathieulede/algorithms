Sunshine, sunshine
You brighten up my days, I'll love you always
Sunshine, sunshine
Never go away, stay right here with me

Baby, when you're around me you just can't do no wrong
Every way is the right way 'cause your love is so strong
And whenever I need you, you're always right there
To let me know you love me and how much you care

Sunshine, sunshine
You brighten up my days, I'll love you always
Sunshine, sunshine
Never go away, stay right here with me

At first it seemed so hard for me to find
Finally that day came and my whole life changed
So beautiful true love has made my life
Brung me happy days, chased my clouds away

I believe the day you came my cloudy days swept away
Goodbye to lonely days
And I know without you in my life is filled with rain
So stay right here with me, oh yeah

Sunshine, sunshine
You brighten up my days, I'll love you always
Sunshine, sunshine
Never go away, stay right here with me

Sunshine, sunshine
You brighten up my days, I'll love you always
Sunshine, sunshine
Never go away, stay right here with me

I believe the day you came my cloudy days swept away
Goodbye to lonely days
And I know without you in my life is filled with rain
So stay right here with me

Sunshine, sunshine
You brighten up my days, I'll love you always
Sunshine, sunshine
Never go away, stay right here with me

Sunshine, sunshine
You brighten up my days, I'll love you always
Sunshine, sunshine
Never go away, stay right here with me

Sunshine, sunshine, sunshine
I'll love you always
Sunshine, sunshine
Never go away
