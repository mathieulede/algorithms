Hold me, Love me
Givin' me all that you've got
Tell me, truly
Can I get in for a spot

For so long I've waited for you to come and love me
Don't waste my time
Cos I need you to let me know if you want me to
Do the things to you that no other can do
(I want you to love)
I want you bad
And I won't lie
And I can't deny
That I want you tonight

Hold me, Love me
Givin' me all that you've got
Tell me, truly
Can I get in for a spot

I wonder what is it that turns me on when I'm next to you
Can't figure out why I want you
Is it lust or love
Either one will do
I want you for myself and nobody else
(Take the place of you)
Right now
Cos it is on
So unplug the phone
Cos I want you to hold me

Hold me, Love me
Givin' me all that you've got
Tell me, truly
Can I get in for a spot
(Can I get into your spot baby)
(Can I get into your spot baby)

Oh baby, you drive me crazy
Put your arms around me baby
And hold me now
Thats what I wanna do (thats what I wanna do)
Right now baby
I want you to hold me

Hold me, Love me
Givin' me all that you've got
Tell me, truly
Can I get in for a spot
Can I get in for a spot
