Girl I've been thinking bout what you mean to my life
Cause I know that without you things would not be right
Don't want to change our situation...at all
...that sometimes my mind tends to wonder to far...

I've seen some others
And there love goes on for years...
Can you assurre me
That we to would last for years...
This is the only way to explain it...to you...
That if I'd ever had to live without...
There Ain't no telling what I'd do

(chorus)
Cause if I'd ever lose my woman...
I hope that I'm the strong one...
I can just see my reaction...
No control of what would happen...
It would surely tear my world apart...
If I ever lose my woman..I'd lose my heart...

Remember when I promised you my faith and trust
I'm here to tell you that I'll never give you up

Baby..my heart is in this...oh...way...
And I don't want nothing about us..to ever...ever change...

(c)
Cause if I lose my woman
I hope that I'm the strong one...
I can just see my reaction...
No control of what would happen...
It would surely tear my world apart...
If I ever lose my woman..i'd lose my heart

Some say its a part of life....yeah...
And sum can understand it....
When others don't know why
But baby life without u...wouldn't mean thing...oh no
I hope this never..never happens to me..no...no..cause
(c)
If I ever lose my woman...I hope that I'm the strong one
I can just see my reaction...no control of what would happen
I'd never feel safe..never feel safe..never feel the same
If I...I ever lose my woman...oh...I'd lose my heart....

If i ever lose my woman....(fade)
