[Chilli]
A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
He's also known as a busta
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass

[Hook: Chilli]
So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and

[Chorus]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Chilli]
Well a scrub checkin' me
But his game is kinda weak
And I know he can not approach me
Cause I'm looking like class and he's looking like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass

[Hook: Chilli]
So no, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and

[Chorus]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Bridge]
If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh yes son, I'm talking to you
Wanna get me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No scrub, no scrub
No scrub, no scrub

[Chorus]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Left Eye]
See, if you can't spatially expand my horizon
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never rising
I don't find it surprising
And if you don't have the G's
To please me and bounce me here to the coast of over seas
So, let me give you something to think about
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens
Satisfy my appetite with something spectacular
Check your vernacular, and then I get back to ya
With diamond-like precision
Insatiable is what I envision
Can't detect acquisition
From your friend's expedition
Mr. Big Willy, if you really want to know
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho?
Not really
T-Boz and all my senoritas
Are steppin' on your FILA's
But you don't hear me, though

[Chorus]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
[Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
[Hangin' out the passenger side
Of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me]
