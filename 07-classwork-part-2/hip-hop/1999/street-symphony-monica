[Monica]:
Oh yeah, oh

There's something that I wanna say
Feel a little out of place
But I need you to make that change
You promised, to keep me out of the rain
I love the cars and everything
The diamond rings
But I love you much more, baby

You said that you were gonna stop when you had enough
Do what you had to do
Now you like the profession you made it for yourself
You said forget about me and you
From now on, all you wanna do is hustle
You gotta choose, whatcha gonna do
What am I worth to you, baby

[Chorus:]
Never thought I'd be afraid to trust
Somebody that I love so much
If I can get him out of the streets
Then he can come back to me
Now I see that it ain't no rush
Baby, to me that's a definite plus
If I can't get you outta the streets
Then you don't need to be with me

Do you love me like you say
Then maybe you could get away
]From the life of doing the wrong things
You promised, don't  make me read about it babe
Think of me before I'm gone
Cuz when I'm gone, it will be too late
Oh yeah

[Monica]:
Repeat 1
Repeat 2 (with Majic ad-libs)

[Majic]:
C'mon home
I see what you're saying now
Well I see what your sayin'
I was trippin' all along

Ha ha
So what you saying I should just leave this alone
Alright but you're gonna take care of me
Make me the king of this throne, for life
Girl I'm so lucky to have you girl in my life
And that's right
I know you love me, I hear you telling me right
Angel of mine, God must have sent you from the heavens above
And oh how i thank You for sending me this unconditional love
To this thug
And for that baby, daddy get out of the game
With no shame
I just want you to remember what started this whole thing


Repeat 2 (with Majic ad-libs)

[Majic]:
Uh huh what what
I'm coming home baby
I'm coming home
I understand now, I'm out the game
I'm coming home to you baby

[Monica]: (Majic):
It's either the streets or me
The trouble is taking over things
(You ain't got to worry no more)
(No more trouble, no more crying)
I know I got to leave
(No more none of that)
But you weren't there for me
It's either the streets or me
(I'm trying to make some money with you girl)
The trouble is taking over things
I know I got to leave
But you weren't there for me
