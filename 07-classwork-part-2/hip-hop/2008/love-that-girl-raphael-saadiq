[Verse 1]
You can tell by her smile
She's such a love child
And every man in this place
Would love to be in her space
As the night settles down
She'd meet a lot of clever clowns
And I'll do my best
To be better than the rest

[Chorus]
She is so (so sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (so glad we've made it girl)
She is so (so sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (So glad were makin love)
Oh I, oh I... Love that girl... oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Then she walks my way
And said boy I hope you're free
I'm thinking how could this be
Feels like a dream to me
Then she gives me this kiss
That gave my whole body a twitch
See you're just so much more than pretty
Gave my heart an eclipse

[Chorus]
She is so (so sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (so glad we've made it girl)
She is so (so sweet and tender)
And I'm glad (So glad were makin love)
Oh I, oh I love that girl
Mmh, mmh

Darlin'.... (Darlin'....)
I'm so glad we found each other
(I'm so glad we found each other)
Holdin' hands (holding hands)...
Kissing....and makin' love and sayin'

[Chorus 2]
She is so (so sweet and tender)
And I'm glad today! (so glad we've made it girl)
Glad somebody sent you my way! (so sweet and tender)
Cause you're so sweet
I could never imagine somebody like you!
(So glad we're makin' love)
So glad that we're making love baby! (so sweet and tender)
So glad we making love baby
I'm in love with you baby!
(So sweet and tender)
