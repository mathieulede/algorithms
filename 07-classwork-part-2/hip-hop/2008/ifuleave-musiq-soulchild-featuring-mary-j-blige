[Verse 1: Musiq Soulchild]
You think I'm so full of it, full of it
But I think I'm just fed up, baby
You think I can be so arrogant, arrogant
But I'm just tryna get keep my head up, baby
You think I procrastinate, baby
But I think I'm taking my time
You think you need to leave
But I think I disagree, but

[Chorus: Musiq Soulchild]
If you believe you'll do best without me
I'll let it go girl, Its over
But before we say goodbye
Lets give it a try
If you leave then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go girl, Its over
But I have no doubt
We can work it out

[Verse 2: Mary J Blige]
Yeah, I think your so full of it, full of it
You just don't know when to let up, baby
I think you're so arrogant, arrogant
But you think you're so much better, baby
That I think It ain't dealt before me
To judge you by your flaws and that's why
No I could criticize but I put that aside
To focus on you and I

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
If you believe you'll do best without me
I'll let it go girl, Its over
But before we say goodbye
Lets give it a try
If you leave then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go girl, Its over
But I have no doubt
We can work it out


[Bridge: Musiq Soulchild, Mary J. Blige]
Now if you wanna go
Baby, then I'll let you go
And even though I'm tryna hold on
I can't let you go
(If you leave me, you're gonna miss me
And I'm not saying that I'll be here waiting)
Since we here right now (instead of just walking out)
Let's work to reach the point that I know we can be

[Chorus: Both]
If you believe you'll do best without me
I'll let it go girl, Its over
But before we say goodbye
Lets give it a try
If you leave then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go girl, Its over
But I have no doubt
We can work it out

[Chorus: Both]
If you believe you'll do best without me
I'll let it go girl, Its over
But before we say goodbye
Lets give it a try
If you leave then baby I'll leave
I'll let it go girl, Its over
But I have no doubt
We can work it out
