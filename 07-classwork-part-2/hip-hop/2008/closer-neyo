[Intro]
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer

[Verse 1]
Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are
Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to own me
To control me

[Pre-Hook]
Come closer
Come closer

[Hook]
And I just can't pull my self away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop

[Verse 2]
I can feel her on my skin
I can taste her on my tongue
She's the sweetest taste of sin
The more I get the more I want
She wants to own me

[Pre-Hook]
Come closer
Come closer

[Hook]
And I just can't pull my self away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop

[Interlude 1]
Come Closer
Come Closer
Come Closer
Come Closer

[Interlude 2]
I just can't stop, No no
I just can't stop, No no
I just can't stop, No no
I just can't stop, No no
No, no, no, no


[Hook]
And I just can't pull my self away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't pull my self away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
Come closer
