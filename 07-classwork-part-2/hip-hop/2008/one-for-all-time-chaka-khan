[Verse 1:]
I can still remember
The magic I saw in your eyes
So honest and so tender
True love with no compromise
All these things I miss
When I reminisce
About you baby

[Chorus:]
Why can't we go back in time?
When I was yours and you were mine
Love this special is meant to be
Eternally our love, is one for all time

[Verse 2:]
How is it that I see you
In every strangers face?
I don't wanna need you
But my stubborn heart keeps going
And I just can't erase
All these things I miss
When I reminisce
About you boy
Bet you didn't know
How much I love ya
Want me to show you baby?

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I'd love to hear your conversation
Intelligent debating
Baby that would move me
The way you make me feel so special
How could you forget that
You were made for me

[Chorus] (2x)

Greatest love of all time
Love will be
(repeat)
