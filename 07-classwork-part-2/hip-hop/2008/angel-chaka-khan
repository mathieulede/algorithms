Troubled little angel
Inconsistent flying blind most of the time
Drama queen

Preening and untangling
The feathers in her wings
Captured by her dreams
Desperately, she sings

Needy little baby
Open up your heart
Don't you think it's bad to feel
Needy little baby
Hiding deep inside
Don't you know your love can heal

Troubled little angel
Inconsistent flying blind most of the time
Don't know who to be, yeah

Always rearranging the wreckage of her life
Ever holding tight
To the hope that she'll be free

Needy little baby
Open up your eyes
Don't you be afraid to feel
Needy little baby
Hiding deep inside
Don't you know that love can heal

Talking to you, angel, angel
Deep inside of me
Talking to you angel, angel
One day you'll be free

Angel, angel
Deep inside of me

Angel, angel
One day you'll be free

One day you'll open your wings
One day you'll fly
