[Verse 1]
I wish I could rip out a page of my memory
Cause I put too much energy in him and me
Can't wait till I get through this phase
Cause it's killing me
Too bad we can't re-write our own history

[Pre-Hook]
Such a mystery when he's here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
This ain't how it's supposed to be

[Hook]
I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all of my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all of my energy

[Verse 2]
Seems only like yesterday, not even gravity
Could keep your feet off the ground when you were with me
How could two be as one
We've become so divided now
There's no use hiding from my misery

[Pre-Hook]
[Hook]

Now I can feel a change in me
And I can't afford to slip much further
From the person I was meant to be
I'm not afraid to walk alone
Not giving up but moving on
Before it gets too deep
Cause you're taking all of my energy

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy

[Hook]

You're killing me
You're taking all of me yeah, oh
This love is taking all of my energy
