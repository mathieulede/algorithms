[Intro: Brandy & Darkchild]
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break has started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
B-Rock, Darkchild
We back
You'll be right here with me
You'll be right here with me

[Verse 1]
When your life is going too fast off the train tracks
I can slow it down
Just when you think you're 'bout to turn back
Scared you might crash
I'll be your ground

[Chorus]
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break has started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
When your tears have dried from crying
And the world has turned to silent
When the clouds have all departed
You will be right here with me

[Post-Chorus]
I will be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I will be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah

[Verse 2]
When you're trapped and there's just no key
And you can't breathe, I'll breathe for you
The fire's got you down on both knees
And the walls are closing in, but I'll be breaking through
And when you feel alone, I'ma be your home
When others come and go, you know I got you

[Chorus]
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break has started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
(You'll see the sun)
When your tears have dried from crying
And the world has turned to silent
When the clouds have all departed
You will be right here with me

[Post-Chorus]
I will be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I will be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeahh

[Bridge]
I will be here right beside you
Every step you take, yeah
I will be your strength, your shelter
Shield you from the rain
Oh, when you feel...

[Chorus] (2x)
When you feel your heart's guarded
And you see the break has started
When the clouds have all departed
You'll be right here with me
When your tears have dried from crying
And the world has turned to silent
When the clouds have all departed
You will be right here with me

[Post-Chorus]
I will be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I will be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I will be right here with you, you'll be right here with me
I will be right here with you, you'll be right here with me, yeah
