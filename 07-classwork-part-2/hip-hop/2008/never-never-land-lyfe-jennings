[Intro]
Oooooooh
Yeah, yeah
You know my mama said
There's only two things in life that are constant
That's change and change

[Verse 1]
It feels like somethin's missin'
But just don't know
It's like I'm not the same man that I was no more
And all these crazy places
That I usually know
Are just not as exciting as they were before
I think about you constantly
It surprises me
How I change
My friends are coming down on me
Saying a playa never changes the game
(But those fellas live in)

[Chorus]
Never never land
Right next to Peter Pan
Cause nobody wants to grow old
(Those fellas live in)
Never never land
They'll never understand
What's it's like to be in love
Never never land
Right next to Peter Pan
Cause nobody wants to grow old
(Those fellas live in)
Never never land
They'll never understand
What's it's like to be in love

[Verse 2]
It feels like somethin's movin' inside of me
My heart is doin' backflips in spite of me
And there's no place
That I would rather be
Than with you and my kids, my family
I think about you constantly
You gonna be my wife eventually
It don't matter what my friends say to me
There's no changing my mind
So ya'll just pray for me

[Chorus]
Never never land
Right next to Peter Pan
Cause nobody wants to grow old
(Those fellas live in)
Never never land
They'll never understand
What's it's like to be in love
Never never land
Right next to Peter Pan
Cause nobody wants to grow old
(Those fellas live in)
Never never land
They'll never understand
What's it's like to be in love

[Bridge]
Hold up, wait a minute
I'm a hustler
Don't be putting my women in it
She ain't got nothing to do with this
She is a deacon
She chills in the pulpit
(Aww, you wrong, dog)
I don even need to say no more
You ain't got the disease
But you expect the cure
Down on your knees praying for that new Porsche
Why she's walking out that door
(She's walking out the door)

[Chorus]
Never never land
Right next to Peter Pan
Cause nobody wants to grow old
(Those fellas live in)
Never never land
They'll never understand
What's it's like to be in love
Never never land
Right next to Peter Pan
Cause nobody wants to grow old
(Those fellas live in)
Never never land
They'll never understand
What's it's like to be in love

[Outro]
I don't care what they told ya
Thirty is not the new twenty
It's the same old thirty
Don't be mad at me, Jay
I'm just the messenger, baby
I'm just the messenger
