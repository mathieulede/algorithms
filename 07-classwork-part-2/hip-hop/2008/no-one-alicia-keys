[Verse 1]
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

[Bridge]
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's going to be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Verse 2]
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

[Bridge]
You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's going to be alright

[Chorus]
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

[Verse 3]
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So till the end of time I'm telling you there ain't no one

[Chorus]
No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
