[Verse 1]
Started out talking right here
Putting it down like a motherfucking mack
Selling candy all up in my ear
She wanna be down like the Ds on the Lac
Slow dancing in the club
Her diamonds look like rainbows
She grinding on my dick
She looking for the pot of gold
We hop up in that AMG and D we in the Westin
She putting moves on me, I coulda swore shorty's a wrestler

[Pre-Hook]
Talking all that shit
Soon as I hit
Now I got her talking like this

[Hook x4]
In a falsetto
She like, ooh, ooh, baby, ah, ah, ah, ooh

[Verse 2]
She's telling all her homies I'm the real deal
Every time she leave the crib, shorty be coming right back
She talking dirty all up in my ear
And I'm finna put this dog right on her kitty cat
I wasn't gon' show you up
But then you got that liquor in ya
Calling last night a fluke
Acting like she didn't remember
I hopped up out that linen, I'm finna defend my title
Fixing to put your ass to bed, tell me which way would you like it

[Pre-Hook & Hook]

Now say that shit

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
She said it feels like her very first time
She said it feels like her very first time
Grind it, grind it
Do it, do it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Grind it, grind it, grind it, baby
Grind it, grind it, grind it, hon
Grind it, grind it
Now say, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh

[Outro]
It's all over now you can come back down
Woo sah
We can talk in this key right here
Woo sah
But any time you want me to take you up
Baby, jump on this elevator
Promise there ain't nothing greater, eh
Take a shower, eh
Let's take a shower, eh
Eh, let's take a shower, eh
Let's take a shower, eh
Let's take a shower, eh, eh
Meet you right back here in a half an hour
Eh, eh, eh
Ella, ella
Ella, ella
