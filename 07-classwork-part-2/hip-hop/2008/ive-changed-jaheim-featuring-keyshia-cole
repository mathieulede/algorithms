[Chorus]
I'm not wildin' like I used to (Oh No)
I don't do the things I used to no more (Baaby)
I've Changed for you (Hey hey)
Looking back, I thought I would never (Ooh Ooh)
Love like this broke so many hearts before (Ooh)
(Hey cause) I changed for you

[Keyshia Cole]
I don't do the things that I used to do no more
Everything that you do, I adore
No more lies, no more games
Everything I say, I mean aye
And all the love you give me baby
It means so much to me
So don't take your love away
No one compares to what you do for me
And every time you see me baby
You take me in your arms, hold me
Trust me baby, I won't ever leave you

[Hook]
Believe me
I'm yours forever
You need me
Cause I'm down for whatever
Damn, I've changed

[Chorus]
I'm not wildin' like I used to (Oh No)
I don't do the things I used to no more (Baaby)
I've Changed for you (Hey hey)
Looking back, I thought I would never (Ooh Ooh)
Love like this broke so many hearts before (Ooh)
(Hey cause) I changed for you

[Jaheim]
Pull out the fine wine glasses, dinner in bed
Went and took some culinary classes
Gotta stay sexy for you baby
Tighten' up my body, workin' on my ghetto Pilates
I'm not going out tonight
We can hit the sofa
Cuddle up, satellite service
Ooh baby, whatever let me accommodate ya
Is there anything you like for me to change

I can't cut my plats (My plats)
But I can't cover up my tats (Ooh No)
Those are two things that I can't take back
But baby it's true, I would change it all for you

[Hook]
Believe me (You gotta believe me baby)
I'm yours forever (Ooh Woah)
Completely (Completely in love)
I'm down for whatever
Baby I can change

[Chorus]
I'm not wildin' like I used to
I don't do the things I used to no more
I've Changed for you
Looking back, I thought I would never
Love like this broke so many hearts before
I changed for you

[Jaheim]
New and Improved, bringing out the best in me
Because the old me was lonely
Searching for my one and only
So happy that I found you

[Keyshia Cole]
Saw the potential
And you made it so simple to loved
And I'll never be the same
[Both]
Ooh baby for you, I've changed

[Chorus]
I'm not wildin out like I used to
I dont do the things I used to no more (no more)
(I've changed for you) Oohh
Lookin' back I thought I would never (thought I would never)
Love like this broke so many hearts before {love like this, so many hearts before}
{I changed for you} I changed for you

I'm not wildin out like I used to
I dont do the things I used to no more
(I've changed for you)
Lookin' back I thought I would never
Love like this broke so many hearts before
I've changed for you
