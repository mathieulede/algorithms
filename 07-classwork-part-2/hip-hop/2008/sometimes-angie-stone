Oh oh.. sometimes

The way I
Love too much and I
Give too much and ya
Take so much
Til I
Ain't got nothin'
And your energy
How it weighs on me
Steady
Drainin' me
Until I'm empty
Wantin' better days
And all your crazy ways
Am I lovin' you in vain? Somebody to help me
I don't need negativity
I just need some clarity (sometimes I wanna love you) ooh ooh ooh

Sometimes
I wanna hate you
Sometimes I wanna
Grab you and pull you close and tell you I love you then push you away
Oh oh oh boy
I wanna
Love you
And sometimes I wanna
Fight you
And God knows that it ain't
Right to
I tell you I'm leavin' and then I say
Oh oh sometimes

Now I give my all
Every time you fall
I'm right there whenever you need me
That's when I'm
Positive
You're insensitive
And just
Knowing this
I'm uneasy
Don't appreciate
Sacrifice I made
Money that
I threw away
Not a dime on me
But all I see
Is negativity
I think I'm getting clarity

Am I asking too much?
When I need for you to hold me just to make me feel better
Am I asking too much?
When I'm asking for the little things you do to bring me laughter
Am I asking too much?
I can't wait another minute
'cause I'm runnin' on empty
When I long for your touch
Your touch, your touch, your touch, your touch (sometimes I wanna love you )

Sometimes I wanna
Hate you
Sometimes I wanna
Grab you and pull you close and tell you I love you then push you away
Oh oh oh boy I wanna
Love you
And sometimes I wanna
Fight you (I wanna fight ya right now ...oh oh oh oh oh... I wanna make ya leave)
And God knows that it ain't
Right to
I tell you I'm leavin' and then I say
Oh oh sometimes

Make you leave... Far to believe...
I wanna stretch my arms and I fall to my knees that's when the heavens open up and pour a blessing on me.... Sometimes sometimes oh you make me so mad sometimes I wanna love you I wanna love you

Sometimes I wanna hate you, sometimes I wanna grab you and pull you close and tell you I love you then push you away, oh oh oh boy I wanna love you, sometimes I wanna fight (fight ya right now) you and God knows that it ain't right to I tell you one minute and then I say oh oh sometimes
