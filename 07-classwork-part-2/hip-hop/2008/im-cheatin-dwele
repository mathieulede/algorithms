Huh, everybody cheat right, come on
Everyone I know
Everybody cheat, oh, oh

I can never affair
With nobody else but you
You sexy as hell
But you know my girlfriend too

She says things about ya
Like how you's a freak at night
How you do things she never
I never get the pleasure

Because of the mornin' after
The shame she would feel inside
The lecture I'd have to sit through
How her momma raised her right

Y'all both rock different hairdos
But y'all kinda look alike
I know the way I can tell it sounds wrong
But it feels so right

Girl, girl, girl, Im cheatin' on my
Girl, girl, girl, Im cheatin' on my
Girl, girl, girl, Im cheatin' on my
Girl, girl, girl, that's my world

I, you drink more than my girl
While she keeps the business post
She dress warm in the summer
While you don't wear any clothes (In the winter)

Rememberin' the other day (when I sent ya)
A dozen of them long stem roses
You told me never ever send roses
You would rather, me send them to the other

And then you took off your clothes
You asked me who I wanted
The nasty one I suppose
We tussled into the moonlight

A break from my everyday world
I fell asleep with my love affair
And woke up next to my

Girl, girl, girl, Im cheatin' with my
Girl, girl, girl, Im cheatin' on my
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl

When love is free
It's a matter of time
Before, before, it's natural

Some have a girl with a chick on the side
I dont need it
My girl is all, shes all I need
So I dont mind cheatin' on my

Girl, with my, girl, girl
Im cheatin' on my girl, with my girl, girl
Said Im cheatin' on my girl, with my girl, girl
Girl, girl, girl

Im cheatin' on my girl, with my girl, girl
Im cheatin' on my girl, with my girl, girl
Im cheatin' on my girl, with my girl, girl
Im cheatin' on my girl, with my girl, girl

Im cheatin' on my girl, with my girl
Im cheatin' on my girl, with my girl
Im cheatin' on my girl, with my girl
