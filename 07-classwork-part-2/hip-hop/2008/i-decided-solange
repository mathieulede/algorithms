Ooh
Can’t hear myself (no nooo)
Can you please turn me up a little bit more

I was a little different
I didn't do what the fast girls do
You studied my rhythm
Now you can speed me up when you want to oooh

They were to cool to run my race
You kept the pace with a smile on ya face
Go head baby (go head baby)
Then I knew he was you (then I knew it was you!)

But first you took me around
Introduced me to your family and friends
And told them how that once we met that
We would never lose
Oh boy

I decided that you are the him for me (I decided)
Oh boy
Cuz I decided that you are the him for me (yes you are)
Oh my boy

How's it feel to win it
When ain't no mountains that you can't move
Your mind is like a prism
For god's light to shine throw ooh

They were to cool to run my race (yeah!!!)
You kept the pace with a smile on ya face
Go head baby (go head baby!!!)
Then I knew he was you (then I knew it was you)

But first you took me around
Introduced me to your family and friends

Telling me telling me wait
Running me down and telling me you were never gonna let go
Is the way you got me
Ooh! The way you got me when you got me baby

Telling me telling me wait (telling me telling me wait)
Running me down and telling you were never gonna let go

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't break my heart (whoa)
Let me take it from you (let me take it from you)
Cause were one and the closer I get
To you the more fearful I become
That would break me in two Honey
