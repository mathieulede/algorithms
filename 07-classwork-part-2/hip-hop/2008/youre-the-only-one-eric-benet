[Verse 1]
I'm going back to the day we parted
And all the ways you were broken-hearted
I take a trip every day in my mind
I see your face, I recall a few words
It's playing back like a broken record
I remember every tear in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
If I knew what I know
I'd walk back in time
I would right every wrong
I would change every line
Then you'd be here right now
Just like yesterday
But you'd feel no more doubt
When you hear me say

[Chorus]
You're the only one I want
You're the only one I need in my life
You're the only one I love
You're the only one I need in my life

[Verse 2]
I see the world through a haze of memories
Other girls don't mean a damn thing to me
It's kind of sad how they just don't compare
Time will tell, let's wait and see
If the love we have was meant to be
Cause I know we've got a future out there

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause you're still my girl
I don't care what they say
Let's go back to our world
Baby, don't you throw this love away
Cause I still believe
In the magic of us
It's just a matter of time
And it's a matter of trust

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Now girl it took some time
To get real with myself
Now love ain't easy sometimes
But when you find it, let's stay together

[Chorus x3]
