[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & (Bobby Valentino)]
Yeah, doin' a buck in the latest drop
I got stopped by a lady cop
She got me thinking I can date a cop
Cause her uniform fit her so tight
She read me my rights
She put me in her car, she cut off her lights
She said I had the right to remain silent
Now I got her hollering, sounding like a siren
Talking 'bout (wee-oo-wee-oo-wee) yeah
(Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee) Yea (wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee) yea
And I know she the law, and she know I'm the boss
And she know I get high a-bove the law
And she know I'm raw, she know I'm from the streets
And all she want me to do is fuck the police
Talking 'bout, wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee
(Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee) Yea (wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee) yea

[Hook: Bobby Valentino & (Lil Wayne)]

Haha, and after we got done
I said "Lady, what's your number?" she said "911"
Hah, emergency only
Head doctor perform surgery on me
Yeah, and now I'm healed
I make her wear nothing but handcuffs and heels
And I beat it like a cop
Rodney King, baby, yeah I beat it like a cop
Hahah! Beat it like a cop
Rodney King baby said "Beat it like a cop"
But I ain't tryna be violent
I'll do the time, but her love is timeless
Mrs. Officer

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd & (Bobby Valentino)]
Mrs. Officer, Mrs. Officer
Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of ya
I'm Kidd Kidd, my face on every wanted poster
I'm wanted by every lady cop all over
That ass so big, I catch a battery to hold ya
My hands so big, you thought I told ya to pull it over
She pulled me over, pulled me out the Rover
Then she pulled me closer, do me in the back of the car
Put me in handcuffs, start ripping my pants off
All you heard on the dispatcher is...
(Wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee, wee-ooh-wee-ooh-wee)
(Wee-ooh-wee-ooh wee)

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]

[Bridge: Bobby Valentino]
Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key
Call your sergeant and tell him you can't finish your shift
Cause it's on tonight
Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast and head
And I can't wait to get it on
I wanna do it all night long, Mrs. Officer

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
