Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans
Boots wit the fur (wit the fur)
The whole club was lookin at herrr
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks wit the straps (wit the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (AYY!!)
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Cmon

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
(C'mon) I ain't never seen nothin that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes, they stole the show
So sexual, she was flex-able
Professional, drinkin X and oh
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see
What I think I - whoa
Did I thank I see shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'mma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them...

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Heeey, shawty what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and the ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack - c'mon, two stacks - c'mon
Three stacks - c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin, baby girl?
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands"
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a solider, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her, so lucky oh me
I was just like a clo-ver
Shawty was hot like a toast-er
Sorry but I had to fold, her
Like a pornography pos-ter, she showed her...

Whooooa, (shaw-taaay)
Yeah she was worth the (mon-eyyy)
Lil' mama took my (caaaash)
And I ain't want it (baaaack)
The way she bent that (baaaack)
Got her them paper (staaaacks)
Tattoo above her (craaaack)
I had to handle (thaaaat)
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin and made me want it
Two in the mornin, I'm zonin
And them Rosay bottles foamin
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock
