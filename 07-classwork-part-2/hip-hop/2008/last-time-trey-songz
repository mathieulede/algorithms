[Intro]
Songbook baby
I'd like to than Mr. Bryan-Michael Cox for helping me illustrate my feelings
This is getting too hot baby, this is getting too hot baby
This the last time, it's the last chapter
But for real, this is gotta be the last time
It's gon' be the best though, promise
Just one last time

[Verse 1]
'Cause if she catch me with you, she gon' kill us
These hotel rooms is looking too familiar
Your love is so, so serious
Girl, you keep me coming back that is
I be with her thinking of you
I be with you thinking of her, my boo
She just don't deserve this
Ain't nobody perfect but I just can't take no more 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm living two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough of the way you put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
Girl for the last time
Yep I said the last time
Girl, this is the last time
All caught up  and it's time to put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
This the last time

[Verse 2]
See the problem is I'm too deep involved
To be playing with your emotions, you really got me open
I gotta figure it out, can't let no pussy come before my baby
Not my baby, no
'Cause she's the only one that ease my mind
But girl, you just so fine, give it to me one last time
Baby, let your hair down, take it to the bed now
Spread them lovely legs now, one last round

[Chorus]
I'm living two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough of the way you put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
Girl for the last time
Yep I said the last time
Girl, this is the last time
All caught up and it's time to put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
This the last time

[Bridge]
Let me see you take off your clothes for the last time
Let's keep this thing on the low for the last time
Tell me how you wanna get it, I know your favorite is the kitchen
From the way I used to kiss it, girl, I know you're gonna miss it
But there's only one condition, baby, please don't fuss
Don't be tripping, keep it pimping
Baby girl, let's just make love
I'm living two different lives

[Chorus]
I'm living two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough of the way you put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
Girl for the last time
Yep I said the last time
Girl, this is the last time
All caught up and it's time to put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
This the last time
I'm living two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough of the way you put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
Girl for the last time
Yep I said the last time
Girl, this is the last time
All caught up and it's time to put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
This the last time
