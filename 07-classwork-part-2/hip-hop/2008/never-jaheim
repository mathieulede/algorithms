I used to be the kinda brother
That thought that i would never slow down
I used to swear that i don't even care what
Happens but baby right now..

I see that
It changed my mind
I mean that
And it took some time
But now i understand
I can be a better man
I never had the chance to meet a lover quite like you
You refilled another part in me
Girl your love is tried and true

Never, Will i break your heart
Never, Will we ever part
Never, Can't believe i used to say it

I used to say
Never, Will i love this way
Never, Give my heart away
Never would this player hang his jersey up
And leave again

Never would have thought in a million years
I would be here..

Thats why i say
Never, will i know the truth
Never, will i know that you would come into
My life and make everything new
Never would have thought that i would take
Your hand girl, i swear
I will never never never never never say never again, again, again..

Baby, baby.. 6x

There's no question that i love you
I know we had our ups and downs
But through the tears i know
There is nowhere i can say i rather be right now

I see that, you are my shining star
I mean that, that you got my heart and now

I hold your hand cause you make me a stronger man
I wish that could place the whole world in front of you
But a man is just a man so baby here my vow to you baby

Never, Will i break your heart
Never, Will we ever part
Never, Can't believe i used to say it

I used to say
Never,Will i love this way
Never, Give my heart away
Never would this player hang his jersey up
And leave again

Never would have thought in a million years
I would be here

Thats why i say
Never, will i know the truth
Never, will i know that you would come into
My life and make everything new
Never would have thought that i would take
Your hand girl, i swear
I will never never never never never say never

From the day you came along
I sung a brand new song
Cause i hold baby clear to see
That you are a special part of me
Before i had no clue i was lost
Till i found you baby
Girl i wanna make the whole world understand
I'm proud to be your man
I'm about to say
I can't believe i used to say

Never, Will i love this way
Give my heart away
Never would this player hang his jersey up
And leave again

Never.. no no never..
No, no, no , no, no, no
I will never say never again
