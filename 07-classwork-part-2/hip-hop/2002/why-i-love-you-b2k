Verse 1
From day one you and I've been friends
Hanging out,having fun,chillin
Now I know at times I got crazy
Silly ways and acting shady
(Ha Ha Ha Ha Check this out)
You peep things in me no one sees
You hold it down for sheezy
Now I have friends I thought were true
But no one more true than you
So what am I gonna do?

Bridge 1
It took a while for me to see
How special you treated me

Chorus
Maybe that's the reason why I love you
You're my heart girl
And with all the crazy things that I do
You're still here girl
No one else can make me feel like you do
You've shared my world
Baby that's the reason why I love you

Verse 2

And no one has my back like you do
Girl you're one of a kind
And you blow my mind(Baby mmm)
And I'm glad to say you're mine

Girl you're the one who changed me
From a boy into a man(Yeah Yeah Yeah)

No one else can make me feel like You do
