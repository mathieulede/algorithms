[Spoken Intro: Ja Rule, (Bobby Brown)]
What up, Gotti, yeah
This is how it's going down
(All we need is a a stage, God)
Ha-ha, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, come on, ha-ha-ha)
It's on and popping, baby
The Last Temptation, ha-ha
He's back
Y'all know who I'm talking about
Turn the world over, B. Brown
Come on, come on

[Hook: Bobby Brown]
I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug Lovin'
I know you're getting bored
Dealing with him
I know you miss my loving, my thugging
Thug Lovin'

[Ja Rule]
I know you're living your life faithfully, safely, away from me
But you miss being next to me, don't you?
Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you wanted
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to interfere
Or intervene on me
Peeling your wide body out of them tight jeans
Wrist on freeze, see it's on me
Shoes 19, coming through in that new Bentley thing
From town to town and city to city
You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy and Bob and Whitney
I'm here cause the Lord sent me to pound puss like a pugilist
But real devilish and freak bad bitches
Forget the story, I know you're getting bored
And that boy ain't getting you horny no more, is he??
Cause when it's all said and done, it's me
Loving, thugging and I know you...

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
Sweet thing living it
Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
But here's how to deal with it
On your weekly visits
Use a code name to protect the innocent
Maybe I'm true generous
Generally believing that all women want me
They don't wanna get even
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God
Betrayal or trust, sustain your vows
Secretly or sacred
Cause I love it when you rock your body-body
Move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi
And roll up along side me
I love to see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is that you need my heat(Ja!)
Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me
Loving, thugging and I know you...

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
Baby, here I'm holding your love hostage
The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless
Cause you been getting at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck them strays
Cause I been in a rage lately
Hoping God will forgive me for all the sin and all the woman
All the drama I been in and it's just the beginning
I hope your watching so you could see that nigga ain't built
Like me!! Black Sheep of the family
But we one in the same, that's why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love looking something like soft porn
Tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him??
But the brightest of your days just going look dim
Cause you fucking with a loser, baby, you can't win
When it's said and done you're gonna need me
Loving, thugging and I know you....

[Hook]
