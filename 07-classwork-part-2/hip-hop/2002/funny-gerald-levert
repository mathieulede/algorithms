Huh, it's gonna be one of them days
I can feel it, uh

[Verse 1]
On a day, like today
I got out of bed, upped and went my way
Tryin' to find some peace within
But here ain't no rest for a weary man

Everything seemed to get me down
Looking everywhere just to find a smile
Then the phone rings and an angel sings
"Hello (Hello)"

[Hook]
And it's funny you should call today
It's been too long, thought you just moved on
And it's funny you should call today
You always found a way to make my day

[Verse 2]
Girl, tell me how is your family
I can't believe that you thought of me, baby
Baby, my heart is beating fast
You don't know how much I missed our past, mmm, yeah

Seen a friend of mine a month or so
She said you're doin' well, you've got it going on
Then the phone rings and an angel sings
Hello (Hello)

[Hook]

Baby,it's like you know when I wa down and out (down and out)
Like in the past when you would bail me out(bail me out) baby baby
And I just want to wanna thank you girl
Just to hear your voice girl, it changed my world

And ain't it funny you should call today
It's been too long, thought you just moved on
And it's funny you should call today
We can just be friends, babe, ain't got to be your man
No way, no way
