[Verse 1]
He is my King, He is my one
Yes he's my father, Yes he's my son
I can talk to him, cuz he understands
Everything I go through and everything I am
That's my support system, I can't live without him
The best thing since sliced bread
Is his kiss, his hugs, his lips, his touch
And I just want the whole world to know, about my..

[Chorus]
Black Brotha, I love ya, I will never - try to hurt ya
I want ya, to know that, I'm here for you - forever true
Black Brotha, strong brotha, there is no - one above ya
I want ya, to know that, I'm here for you - forever true

[Verse 2]
He's misunderstood, some say that he's up to no good around the neighborhood
But fo' your information - alot of my brothers got education (now check it)
You got ya wallstreet brotha, ya blue collar brotha
