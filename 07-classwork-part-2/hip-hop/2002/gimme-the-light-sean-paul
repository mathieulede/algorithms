Jus gimme the light, yeah yeah
Jus gimme the light, yo yo
Jus gimme the light, don't say it
Jus gimme the light, Sean Paul

[Hook]
Jus gimme the light and pass the dro
Bust another bottle of Mo
Gal dem in a me sight and I gots to know
Which one is gonna catch my flow
Cause I'm inna the vibes
And I got my dough
Bust another bottle of Mo
Gurl dem lookin hype
And I gots to know

[Verse 1]
Could I be your protector
Your buff in every sector
Everyman around dem
Wanna turn your inspector
But you no let them sweat ya
No grill you with no lecture
But dem power drill
Or dem fuel injector
Dem a infector
Disease collector
Nuff of dem a gwan
Like dem wan come wreck ya
Done out the part
Where you got in your center
But you know
You dont let themn guy affect ya

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
One, two, three, four, five of them
Situation getting really live again
Girl dem wanna fi hang out with
The players and the riders dem
Beside of them and dem say
Dem tired of the liars
Dem friars and connivers
Will never get inside of dem
Dem clyder dem
Especially the money hider dem
Watchie watchie girl bout dem
A try fi make bride of dem
Denied again
Some of them move like a Spiderman
Girl dem say nah
Open wide again

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Could I be your protector
Your buff in every sector
Everyman around dem
Wanna turn your inspector
But you no let them sweat ya
No grill you with no lecture
But dem power drill
Or dem fuel injector
Dem a infector
Disease collector
Nuff of dem a gwan
Like dem wan come wreck ya
Done out the part
Where you got in your center
But you know
You dont let themn guy affect ya
