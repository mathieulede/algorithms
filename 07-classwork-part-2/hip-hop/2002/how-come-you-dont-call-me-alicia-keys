[Intro]
(But all I wanna know, baby is...) Ohhh
(If what we have is good...) Ohh-woah
(Just pick up the motherfuckin' phone, man) Ayyeeee...
Yeah, baby...Mmm

[Verse 1]
I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything you said
I always thought our love was so right, I guess I was wrong
Always thought you'd be by my side, papa, now you're gone (And I'm not trying to hear that shit...)

[Chorus]
What I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me
Anymore? (Yeah...)

[Verse 2]
I still light the fire on a rainy night (...You didn't think that, did you?)
I still like it better when you holding me tight (Y'know...yeah)
Everybody said, everybody said that we should never part, no, no (We did look kinda good together)
Tell me baby, baby, baby, why, why you wanna go and break my heart?

[Chorus]
Ooh, All I wanna know, baby
If what we had was good
How come you don't call me
Anymore?

[Bridge]
(You know what...) Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If you don't call me, papa, oooh, you got to try
Won't get down on my knees
Won't beg you, please, please, Oh (Ohhhh)
Won't you call me sometime, papa? (You know it's just one lousy quarter...)
Why don't you call me back no more?

[Outro]
Why on earth can't you just pick up the phone?
You know I don't like to be alone
(How come you don't call me?) Why must you torture me?
(How come you don't call me?) Hey, hey...
(How come you don't call me?) Ohhh, call me sometime...
