[Intro]
Na na, na na na na
Cam on, cam on, cam on, ohh
Ohh, this is just for me
Na na, na na na, na na, na na na

[Verse 1]
Kick off my shoes and relax my feet
Hit the kitchen grab a bite to eat
Now, it's been one of those crazy weeks
And I got to do something special for me

[Bridge]
See, hit the salon get a mani and a pedi
Have a massage, get a sip and then I'm ready
Got to take time out
And all my real ladies know what I'm talking about, sing

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, baby, baby
You don't know what I've been going through
Sing it again now, ooh, baby, baby
It's obvious to see exactly what I need

[Chorus 1]
One of those days
When the sun is shining bright
And my life is going right
And the simple things are not wasted

[Chorus 2]
One of those days
When you're cruising in your car
And you might just see the stars
And it's warm outside and beautiful, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Tonight, it's all about me
Just want to set my body free
Never mind the TV
Tonight, I'll just let a little TV watch me

[Verse 2]
Light the candles, aroma therapy
Hot tub bubbles surrounding me
Mr. Big is in the background
The "Isley Brothers" going to hold it down, sing

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

Hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
I need one of those days
You don't know how, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
