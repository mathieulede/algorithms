[Intro:]
I see you, girl
Darkchild
I got my eyez on you
Let me see what you working with
Let's dance, yeah
Come on, come on

[Verse 1:]
When I step in the club, there's so much love
All eyez on me
All the girls and thugs glasses go up
It's that time, baby
If you're looking right and your game is tight
Come chill with me
Get up on the floor and dance some more
The night's just beginning

[Chorus:]
I can feel your eyes on me, you're watching
And off up in the club tonight, it's popping
And I can tell that you're feeling it too
Know you do

[Verse 2:]
Now when I'm doing my thang
You checking for me
Just step my way

Don't you be too shy
Or be ashamed
You get love from me

So when we moving close
We're toe to toe
Just dance with me

And when we've come to an end
Me and my friends
We'll do it again

[Chorus]

Come on
Let me see you work it out
I'm a pretty young thang
I'mma turn it out
Party all night
Working it out
Till the lights out
Till the early morn

[Bridge:]
Don't you know now is the perfect time
I can make it right, making you all mine
Baby, tonight if you hold it down
I can give you all that I got

[Chorus]

I see you, you watching me
I see you, all eyez on me
