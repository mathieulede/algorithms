How did she fall in love
Tired and shaken up
Could it be hangin' around's enough
No one was foolin' when they told about the sense & sensibility

In movin' on

All that I see is that we're livin' life
Did you fall when you found that you paid the price
Hope it wasn't lost in an honest truth
So the past doesn't break all that we've been through
Every little thing that you did was right
But who knows what you did on the day you cried
Endlessly, oh you cried endlessly

Take a message for my love, take a message for my love, take a message
(three times)
Take a message for my love (take a message)

What could I say to you, oh, when makin' the waves was left unconscious
Didn't mean to tell you why oh why
But you harboured all defenses
And you're makin' it hard to bring that hope back for you and I

All that I see is that we're livin' life
Did you fall when you found that you paid the price
Hope it wasn't lost in an honest truth
So the past doesn't break all that we've been through
Every little thing that you did was right
But who knows what you did on the day you cried
Endlessly, oh you cried endlessly

Repeat chorus
