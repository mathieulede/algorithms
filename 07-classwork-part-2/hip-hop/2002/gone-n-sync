[Written By Justin Timberlake & Wade Robson]

[Verse 1]
There's a thousand words that I could say
To make you come home, yeah
Seems so long ago you walked away
Left me alone
And I remember what you said to me
You were acting so strange
And maybe I was too blind to see
That you needed a change

[Bridge]
Was it something I said
To make you turn away
To make you walk out and leave me cold
If I could just find a way
To make it so that you were right here
Right now

[Pre-Hook]
I've been sitting here
Can't get you off my mind
(Can't get you off my mind)
I've tried my best to be a man and be strong
I drove myself insane
Wishing I could touch your face
(Touch your face)
But the truth remains you're

[Hook]
Gone (You're)
Gone (Baby you're)
Gone (Girl you're gone, baby girl you're)
Gone (You're)
Gone (You're)

[Verse 2]
Now I don't wanna make excuses, baby
Won't change the fact that you're gone...no, no
But if there's something that I could do
Won't you please let me know?
The time is passing so slowly now
Guess that's my life without you
(Guess that's my life without you)
And maybe I could change my every day
But baby I don't want to

[Bridge 2]
So I'll just hang around
And find some things to do
To take my mind off missing you take my mind off missing you
And I know in my heart
You can't say that you don't love me too
Please say you do (Yeah)

[Pre-Hook & Hook]

Ohhh...

[Verse 3]
What will I do
If I can't be with you
Tell me where will I turn to
Baby who will I be
Now that we are apart
Am I still in your heart
Baby why don't you see
That I need you here with me
Oohhh...

[Pre-Hook & Hook]
