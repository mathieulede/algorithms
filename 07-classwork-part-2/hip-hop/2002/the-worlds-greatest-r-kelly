[Intro-R. Kelly]
It's the world's greatest, y'all
It's the world's greatest
The world's greatest

[Verse 1-R. Kelly]
I am a mountain
I am a tall tree, oh
I am a swift wind
Sweepin' the country
I am a river
Down in the valley, oh
I am a vision
And I can see clearly

[Bridge-R. Kelly]
If anybody ask you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

[Hook-R. Kelly]
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

[Verse 2-R. Kelly]
I am a giant
I am an eagle, oh
I am a lion
Down in the jungle
I am a marchin' band
I am the people, oh
I am a helpin' hand
I am a hero

[Bridge + Hook-R.kelly]
If anybody ask you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

[Bridge 2-R. Kelly]
In the ring of life, I'll reign love
And the world will notice a king
Wherever there's darkness I'll shine a light
And the mirrors of success reflect in me

[Hook-R. Kelly]
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

[Hook-R. Kelly]
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

[Hook-R. Kelly]
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

[Bridge 3 Over Hook- R.Kelly]
I saw the light
At the end of a tunnel
Believe in the pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
And faith was right there
To pull me through, yeah
Used to be locked doors
Now I can just walk on through

[Outro-R. Kelly]
It's the greatest
Can you feel it?
Say the greatest
Can you feel it?

[Bridge 3 Over Outro-R. Kelly]
I saw the light
At the end of a tunnel
Believe in the pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
And faith was right there
