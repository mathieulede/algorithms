I picture that I can read your mind
And tell you everything you're going through
Baby I've tried to find, i've the reasons why
You're alone and acting so cold

Tell me how long you've been this way
Maybe I can open up your heart
See, I've been waiting all my life
For someone just like you
And I know you've been waiting too
For someone to love you

CHORUS
All you need is someone who cares (Someone to love you)
Someone who will always be there
All you need to say is that
You want me to be with you
Girl I know you waited so long
For someone to love you

Baby I wish I could be there
For every time you ever shed a tear
Baby I hate to see a pretty girl like you
Going through, the things that you do

Girl I think you've gone for far too long
Without a good man to make you smile
How can I appeal to you and make you understand
That I'm here when you're ready for
Someone to love you

CHORUS

Baby you've been waiting for the man from all the fairy tales
Or maybe just the man from all your dreams
Try to think reality, Lets talk possibilities
Cause girl you know you've waited for so long
For someone to love you

CHORUS

All you need is someone...

Repeat Chorus
