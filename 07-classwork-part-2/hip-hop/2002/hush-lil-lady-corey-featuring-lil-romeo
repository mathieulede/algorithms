Now you've been watchin' me
And I've been watchin' you
So I decided to just come and talk to you
Ain't tryin' to run no game
Just wanna know your name
And by the smile that's on your face
I see you feel the same
So can I talk to you and maybe after school
I could walk you home if that's cool with you
And then later on I'll call you on the phone
And then I'll make you mine
By writin' you this little poem

Hush little lady, don't you cry
Gonna bet that I could show you
How to have a good time
Like me and you playin' after school
On the weekend, at the skating rink'll be cool

Hush little lady, don't you cry
Gonna bet that I could show you
How to have a good time
Like me and you playin' after school
On the weekend, at the skating rink'll be cool

[Lil' Romeo]
Oh, oh, look
On the weekend, me and you and some friends
We could go for a ride in the back of the Benz
In the park take pictures, me and you in the Hawk
Play games, hide-n-seek till it get dark
I like when you playin' when you callin' my name
That's how I feel, hope you feel the same
Stuffed dolls, merry-go-round
So me and you sit splash, girl, how that sound, uh

[Corey]
I can tell you're feelin' me, and girl
It's plain to see
That you and me we got a little chemistry
That's why I'm dyin' to do everything you wanna do
Anything that you want I can give, give it to you
So what's it gonna be, is it gonna be you and me
You gotta let me know, don't keep me hangin' on
Tell me what I gotta do to get it through to you
I want you to be my baby, so

Hush little lady, don't you cry
Gonna bet that I could show you
How to have a good time
Like me and you playin' after school
On the weekend, at the skating rink'll be cool

Hush little lady, don't you cry
Gonna bet that I could show you
How to have a good time
Like me and you playin' after school
On the weekend, at the skating rink'll be cool

So here we are face to face
I gave face to treath away
Be patient, girl
Keep it real, I really wanna make you mine
So tell me, so what you gonna do

So here we are face to face
I gave face to treath away
Be patient, girl, now it's on you
Keep it real, I really wanna make you mine
So tell me, so what you gonna do
