Oh, my, where do, how do I begin
To answer the question I know you been wonderin'
When could, why could, how could it all be true
These things, who's that and what's he to you

[Hook]
He is the mind objector, the heart protector
The soul defender of anything I fear
The baby conceiver, the make me believer
The joy bringer, the love giver
He is the dough increaser, the pleasure releaser
The hard knocks knower without the scars to show ya
The night school teacher, the good life preacher
The caretaker, the kiss craver

He is

[Verse 2]
All these words are only frostin' on my cake
Feelings explained, don't do justice to how I feel
So alive, so in love for the first time
No way can I hide who, what

Everything, everything I want and I want it
{he is} so {he is}, so {he is}
And so much more than I thought it could be

I gotta be the same for him {i gotta be the same for him}
For my baby
Oh...oh...yes, he is, oh, oh
I know exactly what he is

{he is, he is, he is}
My joy bringer
{he is, he is, he is}

The soul defender of anything I fear
The pain remover, bad times undoer
The joy bringer, the love giver

Ooh...oh...ho...oh...
Doo doo doo doo doo
