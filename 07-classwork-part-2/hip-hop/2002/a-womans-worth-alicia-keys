[Verse 1]
You could buy me diamonds, you could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world. (baby you know I'm worth it)
Dinner lit by candles, run my bubble bath. Make love tenderly to
Last and last. (baby you know I'm worth it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough, but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

[Chorus]
Cause a real man, knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth

Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm
Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm
Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm, Hm

[Verse 2]
If you treat me fairly, I'll give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should. (baby I know you're worth it)
If you never play me, promise not to bluff. I'll hold you down
When shit gets rough. (baby I know you're worth it)

[Pre-Chorus]
She walks with a mile, makes you smile all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will and she can find a man who knows her worth

[Chorus]
Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
No need to read between the lines, spelled out for you (spelled out for you)
Just hear this song cause you can't go wrong when you value. (better value)
A woman's (woman's) Woman's (woman's) Worth
Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
