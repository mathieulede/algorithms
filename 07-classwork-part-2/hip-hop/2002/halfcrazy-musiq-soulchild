[Verse 1]
Never thought that we would ever be more than friends
Now I'm all confused cause for you I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothing's the same
And really I just want my friend back

[Hook]
And my mind's gone half crazy cause I can't leave you alone (oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wondering if it's worth me holding on (holding on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy cause I can't leave you alone (can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wondering if it's worth me holding on (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'd hate to walk away from you as if this never existed
Cause when we kissed the moment after I love that you different
Lately I gotta watch what I say
Cause you take things personal nowadays
You used to laugh now you get mad
Damn I just want my friend back

[Hook]

[Breakdown]
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah
What happened to the one I used to know (oh yeah yeah)
The one I used to laugh and joke with
The one I used to tell all my secrets
We used to chill and be down for whatever whenever together yeah

[Hook]
And my mind's gone half crazy (oh) cause I can't leave you alone (I'm going half crazy baby)
And I'm wondering if it's worth me (oh) holding on (over you)
Said my mind's gone half crazy (yeah) cause I can't leave you alone (and I just don't know)
And I'm wondering if it's worth me holding on (said I just don't know what to do now)
We used to chill (yeah) we used to hang
We used to do we used to do some many things together (yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
