Uh-huh
Uh-huh
Yo', Mike City
Where the girls at, baby
This song goes out to all the women in the club
Tonight
Let me see you put your hands and your glasses in the
Air

You're the kind of girl every brother wants
And needs in their lives, yeah, baby
No matter what the situation is, you stand by me
Whether I'm wrong or right, ooh

And even when we're in the middle of an argument, huh
Cussin' each other out, oh, yeah
In my heart I'm admirin' your feisty ways
Then we kiss and make up, never wanna let us break up

Baby, keep on lovin' me (Lovin' me like you do, yeah)
Lovin' me just like you do (Ooh...ooh...ooh...believe
Me, yeah, mmm)
I wanna prove to you faithfully (Whoa...)
I will keep on lovin' you

If by chance for whatever reason I got handled
And landed myself in jail
You would call everyone you knew raisin' hell
To help me make bail, ooh...ooh...

That's why I don't mind spoiling you, spendin' quality
Time, huh
'Cause you hold me down, oh, yeah
There's so many women that could learn from you
You know how to keep a man, you just let him be a man
Oh

Baby, keep on lovin' me (Lovin' me like you do, yeah
Yeah)
Lovin' me just like you do (Baby, I want you to please
Believe me)
I wanna prove to you faithfully (Whoa...I'm gonna keep
On lovin')
I will keep on lovin' you (Listen, baby)

Damn what people say {I ain't goin' nowhere}
I see my soul with you forever, baby
Till my dyin' day {I ain't goin' nowhere}
Nowhere, so proud to see you keep on {Lovin' me}

Baby, keep on lovin' me (Baby, lovin' me like you do)
Lovin' me just like you do (Won't you please believe
Me)
I wanna prove to you faithfully (Huh, baby, I'm gonna
Keep) (I'm gonna keep on)
I will keep on lovin' you (Yeah...) {Lovin' me}

Baby, keep on lovin' me (I'm gonna keep on lovin' you)
Lovin' me just like you do (Let me get down on my
Bended knees)
I wanna prove to you faithfully ('Cause I want you to
Believe me, baby)
(I'm gon' keep on lovin' you, yes, I will)
I will keep on lovin' you (Every day, every hour)
{Lovin' me}

Baby, keep on lovin' me (I'm gonna do everything I
Can)
Lovin' me just like you do (Please, please, baby)
I wanna prove to you faithfully (Please believe me
Baby)
I will keep on lovin' you (Oh...oh...oh...) {Lovin'
Me}

Baby, keep on lovin' me (Somebody say I don't need ya)
Lovin' me just like you do (Don't know how much I can
Say, baby)
I wanna prove to you faithfully (Wanna prove to you
Every day)
I will keep on lovin' you (I need you
Baby-baby-baby-baby-baby-baby-baby-baby) {Lovin' me}

Baby, keep on lovin' me (All I want you to do is keep
Lovin' me)
Lovin' me just like you do (Lovin' me, lovin' me
Yeah, yeah)
I wanna prove to you faithfully (Please believe me
Baby)
I will keep on lovin' you (Yo', Mike City, we outta
