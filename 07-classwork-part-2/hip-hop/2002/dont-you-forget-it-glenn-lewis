[Verse 1]
Faraway from that life so young
That's when you used to know
Many dreams since then you've had
Have come and gone that might show
But stress don't you let it
Don't you forget
Trust you'll find your way to love
Hope is what your heart is made of

[Chorus]
And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home
For that little girl
Hold on to your world
And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home
For that little girl
Hold on to your world

[Verse 2]
You're worlds apart
From first where life would start
Understanding what it means to have got
Nothing but your heavy broken heart
The memory of what used to be
With change comes responsibility

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you forget where you are
Ain't where you've been
Life's lessons that
Made you into a woman

[Chorus]
And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home
For that little girl
Hold on to your world
And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home
For that little girl
Hold on to your world

Yeah yeah
Hold on,  hold on yeah yeah uh uh ooh ooh

[Verse 3]
Don't you be afraid
Cause a heartbeat away
Is all and everything
That's ever meant me, and will mean to you
No need to cry, you can dry your eyes
Cause you can count on the love that trough the years
Helped you face your fears and subside your tears
Everything will be okay
Don't you be afraid (no oo oo..)
Don't you be afraid (na na na na)

And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home for that little girl
Hold on to your world
And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home for that little girl (Hey baby)
Hold on to your world (Don't you be afraid)

And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home for that little girl
Hold on to your world
And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home for that little girl
Hold on to your world

And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home for that little girl
Hold on to your world
And don't you forget it
Don't you forget your way home for that little girl
Hold on to your world
