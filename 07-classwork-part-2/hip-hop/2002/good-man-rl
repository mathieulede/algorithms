You could find me in the Gentlemen's club
Substitutin' lap dance just for love, love, love
Goin' home to an empty house
Thinkin' who should I call for some fun, hey

I never knew love until you loved
Never thought that I'd fall in love
Till you brought out a man
The man I always knew I could be, baby

I can't count the lovers that I've had
And all of those relationships gone bad
I wanna thank you for guiding me
And showing me love

I was just a boy and not a man
Falling deep in love was not the plan
Baby, because of you and what you do
You made me a good man, oh, baby

Used to change my numbers every other the week
Gettin' crazy crank calls from them freaks
I be, in V.I.P wit a bottle of somethin
Tryin' hard to push up on some peps

â€˜Cause I-I never knew love until you, love
You showed me a true love
You gave me the chance
Now I understand how to be a good man, oh, yes

I can count the lovers that I've had (I've had)

All of those relationships gone bad (Relationships)
I wanna thank you for guiding me
And showing me love(love, yea)

I was just a boy and not a man (Not a man, no)
Falling deep in love was not the plan
Baby, because of you (You, you, you) and what you do
You made me a good man

Thank you for lovin' me
Where is the love that you promised to love and
When was the love that we share, where is your love
Oh, yeah
But if it ain't you, my love's for nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
(Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...)

I can count the lovers that I've had (Baby, baby)
All of those relationships gone bad
I wanna thank you for guiding me
And showing me the hope

I was just a boy and not a man
Falling deep in love was not the plan
Baby, because of you and what you do
You made me a good man, oh, baby

It's all because of
You-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you
