I got your legs spread all over the bed
Hands clenched in the sheets
Hair wild as hell I know
The only thing on your mind is sexin me
Girl I can feel your temperature rising
You should feel my nature too
Come on you should its gonna be a bumpy ride
Girl let's do what we came to do

Girl when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love
Girl when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love (come to daddy baby)

On the balcony ripping the rails
Slowly I'm pulling you near
Sayin shhhh babe dont make to much noise
There's alot of people who live around here
Emotions running high
My hands planted on your thighs
You feel me going up and down
And round and round and round

Girl when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love
Girl when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love (come to daddy baby)

Girl your drive wait in the back seat
Windows tinted it's getting deep
Fog all over the glass
I dont know how long I can last
With you moaning crazy
Girl keep on calling me
I'll take you to exctasy
And when I'm done you'll be fast asleep

Girl when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love
Girl when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love (come to daddy baby)

The house the boat and the jeep babe
In the tube in the pool or the beach babe
Get your grove on (get your grove on) get your grove on {x2}

Girl when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love
Girl when we make love all night
When we make good love all night
When we make love all night
We really make love (come to daddy baby)
