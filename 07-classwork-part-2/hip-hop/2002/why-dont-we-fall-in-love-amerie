[Verse 1]
So many things I'm goin' through
So much that I wanna do
It startin' to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really guaranteed
So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly, you and I
We fall in love, so many reasons why

[Hook]
Why don't we (So why don't we), don't we
Why don't we, why don't we (Yeah)
Why don't we, why don't we fall in love (Why don't we fall in love)
(It's so many reason)
(It's the only thing that matters to me)

[Verse 2]
Why don't we fall in love
It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one I never want to go
Think I never did know what to do
A love I never felt, now I feel for you
Why don't I just swallow each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend

[Hook 2]
Why don't we, don't we (Why can't we)
Why don't we (Why can't we), why don't we (Why can't we)
Why don't we, why don't we fall in love (We, can't we fall)
Why don't we, why don't we (Yeah, yeah)
Why don't we, why don't we fall in love (Oh)
Why (Yeah)

[Pre-Hook]
Come with me
Tomorrow ain't guaranteed, no
Baby, let's be
Baby, let's be

[Hook 2]

[Outro]
Oh...oh...
No, no, no, no
Whoa...oh...
Oh...oh...oh...
Oh
Oh, yeah
Oooh, oh yeah...
