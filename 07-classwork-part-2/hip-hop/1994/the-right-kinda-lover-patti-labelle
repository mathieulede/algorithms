A real man, strong but tender
Baby that's the kind a man I need
To his love I will surrender
'cause he'll keep his mind on pleasing me

He's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sure 'nuff
He's got the stuff
He's the right kind a lover for me

An interesting conversation
Every once in a while
Always prompt and attentive
'cause my darlin' knows that that is my style

He's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sure 'nuff
He's got the stuff
He's the right kind a lover for me

Ev'ry night when I get down on my knees to pray
I thank the Lord for sending Mister right my way
This kind of love had to come from heaven down
I ain't never gonna let him go because I need this kind a man around

He's the right kind a lover
I'll never need another
Sure 'nuff
He's got the stuff
He's the right kind a lover for me
