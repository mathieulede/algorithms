I'm waiting
For someone who could turn my life
Around
Someone who could make me feel
The way I used to feel
But she never comes

I'm searching
But there's no one that I'd care to talk
About
And all the lovers in the world
Don't amount to much
'Cause what I want is just one love

And I'd give anything
And everything
To fall in love
Just this one time
I'd like to find
What I've been dreaming of
Well I could find someone to hold me
But that wouldn't be enough
But I'd give anything
To fall in love

Now I lay here
I'd rather not be sleeping by myself
Staring at the wall
I question it all
Will she ever come

And I'd give anything
And everything
To fall in love
Just this one time
I'd like to find
What I've been dreaming of
Well I could find someone to hold me
But that wouldn't be enough...
But I'd give anything
To fall in love

I'm gonna keep on making wishes
I'm gonna keep on being strong
I won't settle for less than true love
I'm gonna keep in holdin' on
I would give

And I'd give anything
And everything
To fall in love
Just this one time
I'd like to find
What I've been dreaming of
Well I could find someone
To hold me
But that wouldn't be
Enough
But I'd give anything
To fall in love

I'd give anything
To fall in love

In love...
