[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Well it's the M-I-crooked letter coming around the South
Rolling straight Hammers and Vogues in that old Southern slouch
Please, ain't nothing but incense in my atmosphere
I'm bending corners in my 'llac boi
Cause that's how we be rolling here
Deep, the slang is in effect because it's Georgia
Kicking the khakis and Adidas
Packing yo' heaters cause you 'sposed to, cousin
Catfish and grits is how my flow flows
Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go
See juice and gin used to be my friend from the beginning
Now I'm just a player sipping sauce every now and then
To catch a buzz like a bumble bee, niggas who tried to fuck with me
Get sprayed like Raid cause it ain't nothing see

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
My heat is in the trunk along with that quad knock
No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get you sprayed
Who raise yo block? The one and only OutKast
Many a nigga falling fast and I continue blasting, swiftly
They ain't gon' get me, got something fo' em
The devil up in yo grill and you still don't even know em
Show em, who's the OK like collard greens and Hoecakes
I got soul, that's something that you ain't got
That's why your style is rot-
Ten, stop in the land of ATL
Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale, swell
Swollen got my pockets
Business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

[Hook : Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell ho
We knocking em off they feet like a Southern hustler supposed to do
I's in the house, house like a joint is lit fo my kin folks
And all the niggas that was down, since we been broke
Taking em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Well okey dokey KastOut
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic coupe de ville can you handle that you rat?
I take my time cruising round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers it's your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge, p-u-m-p
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel til it's empty, get me
See I get friendly getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me
Cause sleeping you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

[Hook : Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 5: Big Boi]
Well Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all the - be rolling like that today hoes
So back up off get up on it if you want it ya'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point
With that College Park, hemp-smoke style
Is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

[Verse 6: Andre 3000]
Step up in my shoes you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue
The sun is beaming it seeming
That I glisten, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side
Full of pride
Now ain't that something
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't braille but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches
Dungeon if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, Outkast
Southernplayalistic
