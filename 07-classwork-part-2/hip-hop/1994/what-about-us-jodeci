Come and talk to me
Can I talk to you
Come and talk to me
K-Ci
Yeah, we can do this
I wanna love you (x8)
Girl I'm reaching out my hand
Trying to make you understand
That you don't have to be alone
Cause I wanna be your man
Girl I need you in my life
Just wanna live right by your side
So girl I won't be satisfied
Until you give this love a try

Chorus:
I'm in need of love
And baby you're in need of love
So what about us
On and on and on til the break of dawn, and it's on
I'm in need of love
And baby you're in need of love
So what about us
On and on and on til the break of dawn, and it's on

Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel me
I can feel you lady

Satisfaction guarenteed
If you come and get with me
Girl I can get down on my knees
So let me please let me do you lady
Cause I know just what you need
I need your love
I need your love
Girl listen to me

I'm in need of love
And baby you're in need of love
So what about us
On and on and on til the break of dawn, and it's on

Shoobie doo-wop shoobie doo-wop I wanna love you (x5)

I'm in need of love
And baby you're in need of love
So what about us
On and on and on til the break of dawn, and it's on (x3)

I wanna love you
I wanna love you

I'm in need of love
And baby you're in need of love
So what about us
On and on and on til the break of dawn, and it's on (repeat until fade)
