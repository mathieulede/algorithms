[Hook]
Straight from Crooklyn, better known as Brooklyn
Never taking shorts cause Brooklyn's the borough

[Verse 1: Special Ed]
Panic, as another manic depressant
Adolescent stares at death, now what's left
When there ain't no guide, and a whole lot of pride
It might be a homicide, so let the drama slide
We don't want no problems, B
Get your name in the obituary column sheet
Cause life is too short and it just gets shorter
I wish I had a quarter for all my people they slaughter
Last year alone, in the dead zone
Walk straight but don't walk late
Cause I'm coming with a hate only made from what it made me
Cause nobody ever played me
Now it's only getting worse
Buckshot and Ace in the land of the waste
Kicking you in your face

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
We be doing it up Crooklyn style
What does it take to get you wild
My mentality is getting iller, killer
Instinct that's trying to infiltrate, but wait
I know you wanna enter but I can't let you in
My mind state's the maddest, I'm gone with the wind
Because it is survival of the fittest
When the shit hits the fan I got my shank in my hand
Black man with the permanent tan
I come from the 'ville and never ran, damn!

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
I'm feeling another part of reality
Hit me when I represent the F.A.P
Straight from the 'ville, Tilden played the building
I mean literally when I say I make a killing
For my cipher, see I'm finning to bust a piper
Original heads represent the Brooklyn all-nighter
Do or die I'm saying it's you and I
Bring your click so we can get stone like Family Sly
Peace to C.I. and the Bush
Mighty Mateen, Ruck and the Rock giving the push

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: Masta Ace]
We did it like that and now we do it like this
We did it like that and now we do it like this
Go inside your mind and find a time that you miss
And just think about the steel in your fist
It's just an extension of your arm, it's that ghetto type of charm
That makes all the homeboys swarm
Can I drop the bomb, oh yes I can
Move with the groove, smooth like Geechie Dan
Who is the man, that kid there
Who is the chick with the pick in her hair
Angela, uhh, Davis and we roll like Avis
Rent-a-Car kid, there you are

[Verse 5: Special Ed]
You know where to find me whenever you need me
If you know the Ave, follow the path
To the land of the aftermath but don't frolic in the midst
Crazy ass Crooklyn kids
Cause they always throwing a body on my lawn
I'm getting a Rottweiler without a collar
Get off my block, boy and give me a dollar
For the trouble, or get blown up like a bubble

[Verse 6: Buckshot]
Let's take a sec to think back
To the year of the 7-0 when Brooklyn was the place to go
Flow on a journey up to Crown Heights
Ebbets Field, feel the reel to reel on your life
Trife individuals live in the PJ's
Dee Evil, check my DJ, hey
Play what I wanna play in the day
But in the night, I feel the right took the left
Bucktown, Brooklyn, break it down
Heads from state to state, travel as I unravel the rate
Howard, Tapscott & Sutter
I remember way back in the days playing hot peas and butter
Brother, if you want another lesson, Crooklyn session
Take it back, Black Smif-n-Wessun

[Verse 7: Special Ed]
Press your luck, you get stuck by Buck for your bucks
Masta Ace has the taste for ducks
And duck sauce so tell Lord Digga
Dig a grave for the bones, sticks and stones
While I kick some ancient poems through your domes
Act went back to attack your homes
So, Tip, can I flip? (Yes, you can)
I'm in the World War with Muhammad, my man

[Verse 8: Masta Ace]
Feels so good to be a Crooklyn Dodger
Uh-huh, what's happening to ReRun and Roger
I think I seen 'em wearing Timberlands and running down the block
From Dwayne and Dwayne had a Glock
Cause he be selling rock for the Partridge Family
And Reuben Kincaid drives a 300-E
And he be pimping Chrissy From Three's Company
Plus he stuck Mr. T for all his jewelry
This is a 70's thing from the days
When kids didn't act so crazed in Crooklyn

[Hook x2]
