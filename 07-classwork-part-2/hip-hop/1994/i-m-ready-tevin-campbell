[Verse 1]
Baby, it was uncool to love me
And then leave me standing here now without a goodbye
And maybe I am the fool you call me
'cause I'll be here standing, waiting, to hear you say to me

[Chorus]
I'm ready (you know I'm ready) to love you (to love) forever (forever)
Hey love
Come and love me forever more
[Repeat]

[Verse 2]
Sometimes when I'm alone I feel sad
I know you'll leave me once again and take my pride
And maybe I am the fool you call me
'cause I'll be here standing, waiting, to hear you say to me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And once again I'll be right here
Waiting to share your love
But I hope this time for once
We'll forever mean it, oh

[Chorus]
