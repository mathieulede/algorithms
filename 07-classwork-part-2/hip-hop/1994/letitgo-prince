[Interlude] - Female Voice (Prince)
Ready or not, here I come
(Come on)
(Come on)

[Verse 1]
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason to let somebody know
"Lover here, lover there" - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
"Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows"

[Chorus 1]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus 2]
But now I've got to let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let my feelings show (let it go)
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 2]
All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn, there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except for me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
Fourteen years and tears I've longed to sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass to put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
I am ready for the real (Come a little closer)

(let it go)
(Lay back an' let the vibe just flow)
