[Intro]
Turn it up, my baby, my baby, turn it up
Turn it up, my baby, my baby, turn it up
Turn it up, my baby, my baby, turn it up
Turn it up, my baby, my baby, turn it up

Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go

Here is the way that we get in the mood
The environment is set by you
No matter where you are, it's something to do
Turn the music up and feel the groove

1 - Turn it up, and let's all groove
Turn it up, let your body move
Turn it up, let the rock sound
Turn it up, when it shakes the ground
Turn it up, when ya feel alone
Turn it up, let the volume flow
Turn it up, if it feels good
Turn it up, when you know you should

Why don't you just take a while to enjoy yourself, for yourself
Cause you sure deserve a break today
Don't put off 'till tomorrow, why wait another day
Cause every spirit needs some time to play

This feelin' feels so good, you don't wanna let it go
Step into the rhythm, let it flow
Don't matter who you are, the beat makes ya move
Just turn the music up and you will feel the groove

Repeat 1

Yo, this one's dedicated to them real niggas

To my homies in the streets
Yellin' nella's in the trees
To all y'all fools gettin' beats
(Turn it up, turn it up)

To the cuties in the house
To the hatecha's at the mall
To the brothers playin' basketball
(Turn it up, turn it up)

To the playas and the macs
Gangsta leanin' in them cadillacs
And all them tricks on their backs
(Turn it up, turn it up)

To the pimps and the hoes
To the gangstas and the gigolos
Come y'all and all the rest of y'all nigga-roes
(Turn it up, turn it up)

At the beach in the sand
With a lover hand in hand
Come on yo, that sounds like a plan
(Turn it up, turn it up)

At the park on a picnic
To the fellow with the biggest dick
Don't thik about comin' quick
There's gonna be somebody shovin' in this motha fuck'
(Turn it up, turn it up)

All the feaks in the club
Yo, y'all show the DJ some love
He's the one that you're thinkin' of
(Turn it up, turn it up)

To the cronies in the 'hood
If you doin' like you should
Where Jimmy Brown on wood
(Turn it up, turn it up)

Terry Lewis, Jimmy Jam
Lemme hear that track slam
Ho, yo nigga, I don't give a damn
(Turn it up, turn it up)

Just turn that shit up niggas
