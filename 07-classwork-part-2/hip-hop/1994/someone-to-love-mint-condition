It feels so good when I'm with you
Pure ecstasy
It's just the little things that you do
That makes me want to be right there
When you need
Someone to love

[Chorus:]
Cause if its love you seek
I'll give you all the love you need
Just take my hand
And I'll lead the way
If you need someone to love

Your lips your eyes they get to me baby
And I lose control
Such a warm personality
You make me want it more and more and more each day
I want to be your someone to love

[Chorus]
I'll give you more
More than you've ever know
A love you can call your own
My heart and soul
I'll give to you
I'll be dedicated
I know that we can make it baby

[Chorus x 2]
Someone to love
Someone to hold
Someone to kiss
With you I want to grow old
Someone to squeeze
Someone to tease
So just believe
