Shh...
I know just what you need
Oooh... oh yeah
Oooh... ooh yeah
Oooh... yeah, yeah, alright
Listen, hush

Hush, don’t say a word
Just come on in, my baby
Your body language explains
It all
Girl, you need love

It’s been a hard day
For you and me
But now we’re free
Enjoy a summer’s evening

Now the work is over
Let the tension fade
Now it’s a quiet time
For loving, babe

Let me hold you near me
I ain’t too proud to beg
’Cos it’s a quiet time for loving
Yeah, yeah

Hush, grab a special
Hold that says I love ya, yeah
I’ll rub it on you girl
And you can rub it all over me
I love that part

No phone, no TV
No company
It’s just you and me
In our own world of ecstacy
Ohh...

Now the work is over
Let the tension fade
Now it’s a quiet time
For loving
Now it’s a quiet time for play

Let me hold you near me
I ain’t too proud to beg
Now it’s a quiet time for loving
Quiet time for play

Oh you play the game so well
Using all my energy
Everytime you hold me close
I know you know what to do
When you did
When you did to me girl

Oh oh oh...
It’s a quiet time to play
Hush, ooh
Don’t say a word
Come on, come on
Hmm, ahh

Do you want me
Ah girl I want you
I can’t keep it quiet baby
’Cos I want you, yeah

Hush, love me, to love me
Let me love you, woah
To love me, to love me
Let me love you, oooh

Hush, let me hold you near me
You’ll never go wrong
In my arms, my arms
Let us get away
We gotta get away

I want you so bad
I can hardly wait
Ohh yeah
Do do do, do do do, babe
I want you so bad I can...
Do do, do do, do do do do...
Do do do...
