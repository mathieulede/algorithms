[Intro]
Aight (aight)
I'm aight if you aight (I'm aight)
I be better - get some of that bass
{word, give it up} aight, yeah

Rinking twinking body shaking
'Nough attacking brain's a-racking
Clock tocking Chuck shocking
Flavor Flav ain't never shaving

(One, two, three. four, hit it)

[Verse 1: Chuck D (& Flava Flav)]
It's another record, check it, mad methods
To put my brothers and sisters on a deathbed
You know he cheated, took what he wanted but now you blunted
Suckin' up to the devil, steppin' down a level
It's who they fear is you
Who protects us from us and you from you
Yes and it counts, (fuck the 40 ounce)
I sued them bastards, yeah they got bounced
I did 'em like a demo (threw 'em out the window)
I took a 98 cause I never liked a limo
But pump pump pump pu-pump pump it up
A mad rhyme, for mad times, that's what's up
Some ain't gonna change, I got em in a range
I gotta rearrange, so I'm buildin' back your brain
Wreckin' records with funky stuff
Am I loud enough? (Yeah) You got to give it up

[Hook x4: Flavor Flav]
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

[Verse 2: Chuck D (& Flava Flav)]
Come again with the same old bounce
I'm calling a foul and once again it counts
Mad tense mad tense brothers know
The blunts in the back got the black behind and that's whack
(And once again it's on!)
Hey Jimmy cracked corn cracker singin "I don't care", it's on
I'm coming with a rhyme (what?), I'm lettin go a rhyme (yeah!)
I gotta get a rhyme through the rough and crazy times
Call me a Hannibal lecture, yes I checked her
They don't hear me though, so here I go
I'm sick and tired so Sly'll take ya higher
When I'm taking his sound to bring you down
Rappers ripping a lyrical kicking finger-licking
But to the rhythm I'm giving but never cotton picking
Like James Brown, I'm saying it loud
Am I loud enough? You got to give it up

[Pre-Hook x2: Flava Flav]
Some ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change
Some ain't gonna never ever change

[Hook]

[Interlude: Chuck D, Flavor Flav]
And when I'm coming, some young dumb and fulla cum
Some second guessing my lessons about saving young
Some don't know, like Run said "so here we go"
Where it is inside, whoop there it is
There it is
There it is, damn right
My man X is a bad mother (shut your mouth)
I'm talking about Terminator, he's the man
There it is, can you hit me off with another one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
I never did represent doing dumb shit
Some gangsta lying - I'd rather diss Presidents
Dead or alive, bring 'em and I'll swing 'em
I vocalize, I just rap, I don't sing em
Flick em, and I fling em, you can go with em
Hall of Fame for the game for the points I Dave Bing 'em
Go Grandmama, close but no cigar
I got mine, for I'm using my rhyme
The flow go wherever I want, and that's clever
Give a piece of my time, to prevent some crime
And who behind putting the guns to the young ones
The ones that make 'em is the ones that take 'em
Rugged for no reason, down in duck season
I don't want my mama, on the street wearing armor
So check yourself before ya wreck yourself
Respect yourself, ha, you gotta give it up

[Hook]
