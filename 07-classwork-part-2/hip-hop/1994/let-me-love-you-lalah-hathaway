Telling me what you gon' do
Pointless cause you don't come through
Wasted breathe and words on you
I've done all i can do
It's true one time i let you under my skin
But you overstayed your welcome na na na nana
Planned the tricks you scandalized
You make your moves you try to hide
Cause i began to realize all of your seldom ways
It's true i've made up my mind
Your wrong for me by your side
The love i know but you'll never find
That i'm not in your picture
Let go baby
Gotta let it go
Don't you let it slow your roll
Hold on to the words ( i gotta )
Let go baby
Don't you cry no more
For you remain in control
Baby let go
Let go ( shine shine )
Let go
So to keep it real and true
I'ma do what i'ma do
Best do the same thing too
(right now it's time to move on)
I can't get used to being a pawn in your love game
You won't have me again na na na nana
Let go baby
Gotta let it go
Don't you let it slow your roll
Hold on to the words ( baby baby )
Let go baby
Don't you cry no more
For you remain in control
Baby let go
Let go 10x
Baby baby da di da di dada
Baby let go
Let go baby gotta let it go
Don't you let it slow your roll
Hold on to the words
Don't you cry no more
For you remain in control
Baby let go
