What you want me to do?
Just taste me Horace?
Is that all?
I'll tell you when I get there
I'm the kind of man
Ooh
That will give you just what you need
Just what I need?
Now lay on your back
There ain't nothing I won't do to please you
Take me
(chorus:)
I'm not afraid to taste your love
When it comes to making love I do what I gotta do
I'm not afraid to taste your love
When it comes to making love I do what I gotta do
(Verse one:)
I'm on fire
And the taste of your love
Is all I desire
I wanna get freaky, discreetly
Behind closed doors
Let me love you down completely
And to satisfy I won't deny
There ain't nothing I won't try
Hickies on your neck
Hickies on your thighs
I'm not afraid to explore below your navel
Baby I'm willing
Horace is able
(Chorus:)
I'm not afraid to taste your love
When it comes to making love I do what I gotta do
I'm not afraid to taste your love
When it comes to making love I do what I gotta do
(Verse 2:)
I'll take my time I won't rush in
Make sure you're nice and wet before we begin
To make love
I'll run my tongue up over your body
Caress you oh so gently
Love you down completely
I'll get down to it
You know I'll do you right
I'm not a minute man
I'll make it last all night
I'm not afraid to explore all your sexy body
Baby come over and lay down beside me
(Chorus:)
I'm not afraid to taste your love
When it comes to making love I do what I gotta do
I'm not afraid to taste your love
When it comes to making love I do what I gotta do
(Bridge:)
Baby I'm hungry
Come to mommy baby
Won't you feed me?
I got it right here
Aww Yeah
Can I, Can I eat right there?
It's yours baby
Is it good?
Yeah
Ahh you know you like it
Don't front baby
Just give it here
Oh oh oh girl
I'm not afraid to taste your love
{I'm not afraid to taste your love}
When it comes to making love
{Making love}
I do what I gotta do
{Do what I gotta do}
I'm not afraid to taste your love
{I'm, I'm not afraid baby}
When it comes to making love
{ooh}
I do what I gotta do
{I'm willing, baby I'm able}
I'm not afraid to taste your love
When it comes to making love
{On the coffee table,}
I do what I gotta do
{baby don't deny that,}
I'm not afraid {on the kitchen floor} to taste your love
{baby just close the door}
When it comes to making love
{whatever you want me to do,}
I do what I gotta do
{baby whatever}
I'm not afraid to taste your love
When it comes to making love
{In the backseat of my car}
I do what I gotta do
{Girl you know who you are}
I'm not afraid{oh} to taste your love
{Taste your love}
When it comes to making love
{Love}
I do what I gotta do
{All I desire}
I'm not afraid to{I'm on fire} taste your love
{Just wanna take you higher}
I do what I gotta do
{see baby I wanna get freaky}
