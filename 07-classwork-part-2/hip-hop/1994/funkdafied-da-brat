[Refrain x3]
So, So, So Funkdafied
So, So, So Funkdafied
So, So, So Funkdafied

[Jermaine Dupri]
Open up, open up
And let the funk flow in
From this nigga name J and his new found friend

[Da Brat]
I'm hitting switches like Eric on the solo creep
For yo jeep it's the B.R.A.T

[Jermaine Dupri]
Putting the dip in your hip from right to left

[Da Brat]
It's the ghetto ass bitch and I'm So So Def
Nigga that's my click, nigga that's who I rolls with
And we kicks nothing but the fat shit
Them calls me the funkdafied, funkalistic, vocalistic
With the real shit, we got the shit you can't funk with
[Why?]
Because we so funkdafied
[Why?]
We make you move from side to side
Well, it's da G H da E T T O, nigga
Brat and J.D. coming like that big baby
So lay back and listen as I catch up on my pimping
And freak this duet just like Ashford and Simpson

[Refrain x4]

[Da Brat]
Putting it down ain't no thang to me
And ain't too many hoes that can hang with me
It's like that and as a matter of fact
When it comes the Brat tat-tat-tat
I got the shit to make your neck snap back
Meaning I got the shit that a get'cha bent
Tear the roof off this mutha like Parliament
I'm on a roll In Control like Janet, dammit
Brat, you're the funk bandit and they can't handle it
I know, that's why I keep hitting em with this grammer
Letting niggas know that I'm the real mama jama
Straight to the head like a chronic sack

[Jermaine Dupri]
I pass the mic to the Brat

[Da Brat]
And yo I passed it back

[Jermaine Dupri]
Well, a sistas and fellas
It's time to get your groove on
I provide the funkdafied sounds that make yo move, homes

[Da Brat]
Breaking these fools off proper like
It's S.O. S.O. D.E.F. dynamite

[Da Brat]
Humunah, humunah, comin' up at cha like Ralph K
And since this ain't no Honeymoon, I'm here to stay
And the way we coming at cha
Baby we can't miss
There's a new Tag Team in town

[Jermaine Dupri]
Nigga, Whoomp, there it is

[Refrain x5]
