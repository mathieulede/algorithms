Sunrise, there's a new sun a-risin'
In your eyes I can see a new horizon
Realize, that will keep me realizin'
You're the biggest part of me
Stay the night, need your lovin' here beside me
Shine the light, need you close enough to guide me
All my life I've been hopin' you would find me
You're the biggest part of me

[Chorus:]
Well, make a wish (make a wish)
Well and I will make it come true
Make a list (make a list)
Of the things He'll do for me
Ain't no risk now
Let His love rain down on you
So He can wash away the past
So that we may start anew
Rainbow, risin' up on my shoulders
Love flows, gettin' stronger as we're older
All I know, all I wanna do is serve Him
He's the life that breathes in me
Forever, and your word is yet forever
Together, we will always be together
For better, and for me there's nothin' better
You're the biggest part of me

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
More than an easy feelin'
He is my joy thing
How can I tell you what it means to me
Found someone who believes in me
Hey, hey

[Chorus]
Rainbow, risin' up on my shoulders
Love flows, gettin' stronger as we're older
All I know, all I wanna do is serve Him
He's the life that breathes in me
Forever, and your word is yet forever
Together, we will always be together
For better, and for me there's nothin' better
You're the biggest part of me
