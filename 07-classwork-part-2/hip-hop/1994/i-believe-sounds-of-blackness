I believe...

Chorus:
I believe in the power and I never ever doubt
Every minute every hour I believe...
I believe in myself cause I know ill get my help
From the power in the sky I believe..
Verse 1
No need askin where ive been just ask me where im goin, cause i won't be ashamed to tell ya,i live my life knowin, all the roads ahead of me are filled with peace and love

Every step so heavenly you'll fall and bounce right up
All miracles and dreams are realized for me through faith
Nothing seems impossible if you believe
Chorus
Verse 2
Lookin in the mirror I can see my eyes are glowing, living testimony, that the spirit keeps me goin, oh im feeling so good, got to raise my hands an rejoice, say a few words to praise him, everytime i lift my voice, all miracles and dreams realized for me through faith nothin seems impossible if you believe..
