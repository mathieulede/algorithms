[Chorus]
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I ain't satisfied
You don't have to worry, I won't waste your time, I ain't satisfied

[Verse 1]
Love is made, made of many things
And one of them is trust but I can't trust you anymore
Things you say, say, how about the things you do?
They won't hurt me, no, they won't hurt me anymore

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Love can make, make a stronger man but you don't love me
You don't love me and I don't feel you're always strong
The hearts you break with your simple lies and you
Better watch out baby, the next heart may be your own
I gave you my love, my life, my time, mine was your own
Though you stripped me to the bone
When I asked you how you feel, if our love was the deal
You told me, we got it goin' on, now I feel that love is gone

[Chorus]

I'm alright, I'm alright, I gave you my love, my heart
And soul, you took my love, now you want to take control
When a good thing comes your way
Why can't you stay? I can't go on another day

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You know I'm gonna be alright, you know I'm gonna be alright
You know I'm gonna be alright, why? Why? Why?
You know I'm gonna be alright, you know I ain't satisfied
You know I'm gonna be alright, you don't have to worry
