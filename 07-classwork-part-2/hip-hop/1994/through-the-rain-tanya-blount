I'm not looking for a fantasy
All I want is reality and you
I'm not looking for a diamond ring
Not into material things
All I want is your love

I'll be there
Through the thick and rhin
Keeping my loving strong
It will go on and on
And on and on and on

Through the rain
And storms together
We can make it last
Boy, you know our love's forver
Take the time to see

And we'll go through
The rain and storms together
We can make it last
Boy, you knew our love's forever
Take the time to see

Hard times may come and go
But I'm here to let you know
I'll be here by your side

No matter what they may say
Your faith can abide in me
I'll always be here for you, baby

It doesn't matter how hard it gets
I'm keeping my loving strong
It will go on and on
And on and on and on

Through the rain
And storms together
We can make it last
(Gonna make it last)
Boy, you know our love's forver
Take the time to see
(Take the time)

And we'll go through
The rain and storms together
We can make it last
Boy, you knew our love's forever
Take the time to see

Don't you worry
I know the stormy night?
Here to tell you
Everything's gonna be all right

Through storm and rains
I'll be there by your side
That's what love is all about

Through the rain (through the rain)
(Through the rain) through the rain
(Through the rain, through the rain)
(Through the rain, through the rain)
(Through the rain, through the rain)
(Through the rain, take the time to see)

I said through the rain
(Through the rain, through the rain)
I said through the rain
(Through the rain, through the rain)

I'll be missing you, baby
(Through the rain, through the rain)
(Through the rain, take the time to see)
I ain't going nowhere, baby

(Through the rain, through the rain)
Through storms together
(Through the rain, we can make it last)
Boy, you know our love's forever
(Through the rain, take the time to see)

And we'll go through
(Through the rain, through the rain)
The rain and storms together
(Through the rain, through the rain)
We can make it last
(Through the rain, through the rain)
Boy, you knew our love's forever
(Through the rain, take the time to see)

No matter what they may say
Your faith can abide in me
Now that I bring myself to say

I'm not looking for a fantasy
All I want is reality and you

And we'll go through
The rain and storms together
We can make it last
Boy, you knew our love's forever
Take the time to see...
