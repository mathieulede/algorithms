[Intro]
My mind is telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
I (baby) don't want to hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess (chill)

[Hook]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind


[Verse 1]
See I know just what you want
And I know just what you need girl
So baby bring your body to me (bring your body here)
I'm not fooling around with you baby
My love is true (with you) with you is where I want to be (girl, see)

[Pre-Hook 1]
You need someone
Someone like me
To satisfy your every need

[Hook]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind


[Verse 2]
You say he's not treating you right
Then, lady, spend the night
I'll love you like you need to be love (Girl, won't you try some of me)
No need to look no more
Because I've opened up my door
You'll never feel another love you see

[Pre-Hook]
You need someone
Someone like me (girl)
To make love to you baby constantly
You need someone
Someone like me (girl)
To make love to you baby constantly

[Hook]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
