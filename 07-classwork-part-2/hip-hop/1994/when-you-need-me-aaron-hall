Who was there for you
When you needed a real man to hold?
And who was there for you
When you needed a shoulder to cry on?

Through all the men you supposedly have loved
I'm the only man that stayed be your side
I promise you baby till the day I die
Whenever you need me I'll be there

When you need me, oh, when you need me
When you need me, I'll be right there
When you need me, oh, when you need me
When you need me, oh

When you need me, oh, when you need me
When you need me, I'll be right there
When you need me, oh, when you need me, oh

Before you go to sleep don't forget to say a prayer
Say a prayer to the Lord above that he would keep us near
'Cause true love is hard to find, so baby, let?s not waste no more time
Only God knows how much I really love you
I don't want nobody else but you, baby

When you need me I will be right by your side
When you need me I will be there before you can call me
When you need me you don't have to worry or cry
'Cause when you need me I will be there

I was blessed the day I found you, sometimes I just can't believe
That someone like you, so beautiful, can stay with a man like me
So, whatever made us sad in our past, let's put all that behind
'Cause what we share right now is a sacred vow
I'll be with you, I'll be with you, ooh baby, baby

When you need me I will be right by your side
When you need me I will be there before you can call me
When you need me you don't have to worry or cry
'Cause when you need me I will be there

You and I is all that we need, baby
So let's not look nowhere else, baby, for love
Satisfaction is what I'm guaranteed to give
So hold me, kiss me, never leave me baby
'Cause I promise, baby

I'll be right there for you before you call
I'll be right there for you, I'll hold you all night long
I'll be right there for you, I'll help you ease your pain
I'll be right there for you, I'll be there for you

I'll be right there for you to dry your eyes
I'll be right there for you sweet baby, don't you cry
