Oh, so long for this night I've prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon's in the sky for our love

If allowed, may I touch your hand
And if pleased, may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what it is that was always meant
Is a ribbon in the sky for our love

In the sky, in the sky
(Ribbon)
In the sky, in the sky

We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I and I
And a ribbon in the sky, a ribbon in the sky
(Ribbon in the sky)
A ribbon in the sky for our love
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love, oh yes

Ribbon in the sky
Don't you know there is a ribbon in the sky, listen

For so long for this night I've prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon's in the sky for our love

It's is no coincidence or a lucky chance
Ribbon in the sky
It's is no coincidence or a lucky chance
Ribbon in the sky

It's is no coincidence or a lucky chance
Ribbon in the sky
It's is no coincidence or a lucky chance
Ribbon in the sky

It's is no coincidence or a lucky chance
Ribbon in the sky
It's is no coincidence or a lucky chance
Ribbon in the sky
