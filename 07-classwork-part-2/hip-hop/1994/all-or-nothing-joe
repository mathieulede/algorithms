Believe it theres no limit
You wanna be my lady

Verse 1:
I told you from the start
Just how things would be
Expectation for the one
Who would be with me
Now i tell you once again
I hope you understand
Just what you have to do
If you want a second chance
I don't need a fool around kind of woman
A woman who just can't be
Happy and devoted
Just to me
I need a one of ten kind of woman
A woman that i can trust
Who is grateful and concerned
About us

Whose class looks real good
Treats her man the way that she should
One who would give me all her love
One who will have me wanting more

I don't need a fool around kind of woman
A woman who just can't be
Happy and devoteeeeed just to me
I need a one of ten kind of woman
A woman that i can trust
Who is grateful and concerned

Bridge: i need someone yeah
Someone to hold me tight
