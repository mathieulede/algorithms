Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax

Here we are in the room together
Holding hands and it's gonna get better
And I know that you're in the mood, yes

So I put your purse down
And take off your jacket
Oh girl it's about to get nasty
You'll love what we gonna do

So lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax

Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax, relax, relax
Lay your head on my pillow
And just relax

The cutie pies they all know
They can always lay on my pillow
The cutie pies they all know
They can always lay on my pillow

The cutie pies they all know
They can always lay on my pillow
They can always, they can always
