(Intro)
Yeah, I don't want you to hold back any longer baby
Because tonight, I'm gonna give you all the little things
I know you've been waiting for so brace yourself, and listen

(Verse 1)
I hear you callin', Here I come baby
To save you, oh oh, baby no more stalling
These hands have been longing to touch you baby

And now that you've come around, to seeing it my way
You won't regret it baby, and you surely won't forget it baby
It's unbelievable how your body's calling for me
I can just hear it callin', callin' for me

(Chorus)
My body's callin' for you, my body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you, my body's callin' for you


(Verse 2)
Tell me, what's your desire, baby your wish
Is my will oh yes it is baby, let me take you higher
Show you how you should feel, baby
Oh, so I speak now and forever hold your body

Whatever it is you want from me, lady
You see you don't have to say nothing
I know when your body wants something
And it's easy for me to see that your body's callin' for me

(Chorus)
My body's callin' for you, my body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you, my body's callin' for you

(x4)
I'm listening baby, I hear you callin' me

My body's callin' for you, my body's callin' for you
My body's callin' for you, my body's callin' for you

See your body's yearning for me
You see I'm wild enough to know when a body's yearning
I"ll say it again, You see I'm wild enough to know when somone's yearning
Girl you want me, because I can hear you callin' for me
I can hear it a mile away, callin' for me

My body's callin' for you, my body's callin' for you
