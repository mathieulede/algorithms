U send me swingin'
Oh u send me swingin'

[Chorus]
I wait for the day
So we can go swing
Won't you look right my way
Oh you send me swingin'
U send me swingin'
Oh u send me swingin'

[Verse 1]
I never thought I really find
Someone so beautiful and kind
Oh what you've done to me
With just the little things you do
You've got me crazy over you
And it's getting stronger

[Bridge]
When I'm with you
I fall deeper in love
Swingin'
This feeling is the one thing my heart is sure of
So I...

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Just thinking 'bout you
And all the things that we could do
(together as one)
If only you could see
How sweet your love is to me
So Heavenly

[Bridge]
No other way
To say just how I feel for you
Swingin'

See everyday that passes
My heart swings closer to you

[Chorus]

When I'm with you
I fall deeper in love
Swingin'
This feeling is the one thing my heart is sure of
So I...

[Chorus x2]

[Ad-Libs]
Oh you know you
Swingin' me
'Round and Round
My heart's
A joyful sound

Waiting for you
To come my way
I'll swing you, I'll swing you
My way
