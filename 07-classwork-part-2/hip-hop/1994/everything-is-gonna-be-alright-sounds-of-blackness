[Intro:]
Alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Alright, alright
It's gonna be alright, yeah
Alright
Everything is gonna be alright

[Verse 1: Billy Steele]
I feel like just blowin' up
Life out here is mighty rough
All these things I can't control
Got me by the strangle hold

[Pre-Chorus: Carrie Harrington]
It's so hard for us to deal with the harsh realities
That can take us to a place where we never want to be
But in time all things are healed
Keep your head up, don't give in
'Cause in just a little while
Everything will be alright

[Chorus:]
Everything is gonna be alright
Let me help your peace of mind
Everything is gonna be alright
(Sure enough gonna be alright)
Everything is gonna be alright
There's gotta be a little pain sometime
Everything is gonna be alright
(Sure enough gonna be alright)

[Verse 2: Big Jim Wright]
Said it's my turn, but you don't notice me yet
What you see is what you're gonna get
No I won't change and if I'm acting insane
Then I'm playing in the key of what you want me to be

[Pre-Chorus: Core Cotton]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus: Core Cotton]

[Chorus]

Said it's gon' be alright
Said it looks like it feel alright
See now

[Chorus]
