[Intro: Dwayne Wiggins]
I remember when we first started this song
All the fellas: Tim, Raphael… Who me? I'm Dwayne
[Course starts & repeats in background]
And I'm an Aquarius
See we were over in Trinidad Tabaga for a while
We met a few friends, had a good time, ya know
But while we were there, we experienced something called… Slow Wine
Naw it's not a drink. Pay attention, let me explain...

[Verse 1]
Say lady, you know the one thing that we're missin'
Please girl pay attention, you see I'd rather show than tell
How you, you've got to lift up my emotions
But slow plus a four letter word is the one thing on my mind
(Slow wine, so fine) If I can wine you in my arms
(From left to right) Slow wine
(Slow wine, so fine) Yeah, just let your body flow
(From left to right) So nice if we could…

[Course]
(Slow Wine) gotta keep it nice and slow
(Slow wine) gotta use your body and soul
(Slow Wine) gotta keep it nice and slow
(Slow wine) gotta use your body and soul

[Verse 2]
Well I, I got the notion that you want to…
Oh what a beautiful thought, slow wine by candle light
It would be nice, try to imagine the fun that we'd have
Girl you'd be the roller coaster and I'd like to take a ride
It would be so nice
(Slow wine, so fine) If I can wine you in my arms
(From left to right) Slow wine
(Slow wine, so fine) Hey Girl! All my body's yours
(From left to right) Now it would be, now it would be so nice
If we could…

[Course][X2]

[Bridge]
Slow and the four letter word, is the one thing on my mind
And if all should come so natural that a child could learn to flow
No, I'm not talking sex, maybe later but for now just flex
'Cause I've finally built up the nerve to just slow wine with you would be…

[Course in background]
It would be so nice if you could use your body
Won't you keep it close to me
Nothin’ more! You and I slow, slow, slow, slow wine
Ya baby!
