Girl, you know you knock me out
You looking real good with your dukes on baby!
Girl you know you knock me out

Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy
Summer bunnies drive me crazy

1,2,3,4 it's time for me to jet
Where ya goin' off R?
The beach, that's a bet
It's summertime so it's time to get  summer, b summer
Some of those and I won't call hoes!
Cause in the 90s you gotta respect the ladies
So step up to 'em and say, we love you sweet Sadie
That's how you get your true mack on but
Brothers be steppin' up poppin' that sad song
Hey don't I know you from somewhere?
Can we go somewhere to be alone?
I pull up in the lot, pop the trunks
Make their heads bob
And it's sunny so it's time to get a summer bunny

[Hook] x4

It's five o'clock and my voice code is 22
So beep, beep, beep, it's time for me to make a move
I'm on my way to a picnic, ayo R we got time it don't start till 6
But I wanna be early, fool
So I can catch the new bunnies comin' in
Like the old school
Strollin' the block so I can check the scenery
The sun blaze, the day is feelin' good to me
I can just smell the funky beats
You know the flavor in between the sheets
I saw my boy Big L, let's get this straight, he said I know I got a album and a mail a day
So who's the bunny lookin' sweet like a honeycomb?
He said, "No my brother, you got to get your own"

[Hook] x4

This party is packed, word to the mother
I love it when there's three bunnies for one brother
And wine coolers is what I'm packin'
And when I get my buzz on is when I start bunny-jackin'
Jackin' fools for their bunnies!
Cause I'm the K, the E, the double L, the Y
They wanna get with me
And the PAs in the house
So check, check, check it out
My stomach is growlin' so it's time to get my hungry on
Some soul food, Kool Aid and you know it's on
Than after that I hate to eat and run but I'm outty my homie Tamika invited us to a block party!
So we roll up in all I saw was thousand daisy dukes
The brothers yellin', summer bunnies!

[Hook x4]

[x4]
Let's break it down -
You're lookin' real good with your dukes on, baby

[8x]
Ayo Dre! Ayo what up Check it out!
Girl you know you knock me out! Get it!

[Hook until the song ends]
