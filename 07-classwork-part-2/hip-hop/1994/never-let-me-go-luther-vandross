Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tommorow
My darling won't you hold me tight
And never let me go

Dry your eyes
No tears, no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might
And never let me go

A million times or more

We said we'd never part
But lately I find
Your a stranger in my heart

Give me the right
In summer or in spring time
To tell the world that your mine
And never let me go
And never let me go
