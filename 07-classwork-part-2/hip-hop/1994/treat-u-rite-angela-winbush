Come on, (3x)
Ooh, ooh
Come on baby
Let me show you how (4x)

Your imagination it seems
Your letting it run away
So tell me
Have I ever dissed you
And if i did it was
Because you deserved it

I would never leave you
Unless you gave me a reason to
Until then i'm gonna love you
And stick by you
You don't have to worry

Chorus:
You know
I'm gonna treat you right
(Gonna treat you right)
You know
I'm gonna treat you right
Treat you right
(Gonna treat you right)
You know
I'm gonna treat you right (oh, no)
You know
I'm gonna treat you right (baby)
(Ooh, i'm gonna treat you right, ooh)

I see a little tension
You know
It's written all over your face
Boy, a little affection
I'll give it to you
Any time and any place
You don't have to worry
You know
I'll be right there for you
All i want
Is a little in return
So honey, won't you show me
That you love me too

(Chorus)
Ooh, gonna treat you right
I'm gonna treat you right, boy
Ooh, ooh
Treat you right, ooh
Gonna treat you righ boy
That's what im gonna do
Gonna treat you right boy
Oh, ooh
Yea gonna treat you right
Love yes i am, ooh
Ooh

(Come on baby 4x)

You don't have to worry
You know i've been right
There for you

(Chorus)
Every day yea
And every knight boy
All of my life
Baby
I'm gonna treat you right

Gonna treat you
Gonna treat you, you, you
I gotta treat you right

Bump Bee Yah Doo
Baby don't you know
That i treat you right
Bump bee yah do baby (3x)
