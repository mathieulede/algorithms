One can have a dream, baby
Two can make a dream so real
One can talk about being in love
Two can see how it really feels
One can wish upon a star
Two can make a wish come true, yeah
One can stand alone in the dark
Two can make a light shine through
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
One can have a broken heart
Living in misery
Two can really ease the pain
Like a perfect remedy
One can be alone in a bar
Like an island he's all alone
Two can make just any place
Seem just like being at home
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two, yeah
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two, ha
One can go out to a movie
Looking for a special treat
Two can make that single movie
Something really kind of sweet
And one can take a walk in the moonlight
Thinking that's it's really nice
But two lovers walking hand in hand
Is like adding just a pinch of spice
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two
Ooh, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ooh, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ooh, doo, doo, doo, doo
Ooh
It takes two, baby
It takes two, baby
Just me and you
You know it takes two, ha
It takes two, baby, yeah, yeah
Me and you, just me and you
It takes two, baby
