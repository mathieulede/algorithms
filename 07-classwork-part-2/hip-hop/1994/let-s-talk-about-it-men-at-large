Baby, can we talk? Let's talk, wanna talk about
(Love)
Baby, can we talk? Let's talk, wanna talk about
(Sex)
Baby, can we talk? Let's talk, wanna talk about
(Your mates)
Baby, can we talk? Let's talk, wanna talk about
(C'mon, let's flex)

Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

Baby, I enjoy
The dinner, the movie, the time, we spend together
Now I wanna get serious, yeah
Won't you take my hand?
Turn the lights down low so I can get you in the mood
Girl, I wanna groove with you

Let's talk about it
Let's talk
(C'mon, baby)

About the birds
(About the birds)
And the bee's
(And the bee's)
Sugar, you and me, getting it on

Let's talk about it
(Let's talk, I really wanna talk about)
Let's talk about a kiss and a touch
I want you so much

Ooo, I can feel the heat
I can look in your eyes and tell that you feel it too
Baby, you whine as much as I do
I'll take my turn and do it real slow
'Cause I wanna feel, I wanna feel every part of you

Let's talk about it
Let's talk
(C'mon, baby)

About the birds
(About the birds)
And the bee's
(And the bee's)
Sugar, you and me, getting it on

Let's talk about it, let's talk
(Ooo, I wanna talk about it)
About a kiss and a touch
I want you so much
(I want you so much, ooo)

Can we roll?
I want to make you scream until you, lose control
Touch you all over your body, have it your way
Don't have to get right to let a little more foreplay
I know you like it, baby, yeah

Call my name, I'll make it worth your while
Glad you came, I'm gonna get you, babe
(Ooo)
I aim to please, do the thing that'll make you
Weak in the knee

Baby, can we talk, wanna talk?

Let's talk about it
(Oh)
Let's talk
(I really wanna talk, yes I do)

About the birds
(Birds)
And the bee's
(And the bee's)
Sugar, you and me, getting it on

Let's talk about it
(Let's talk about it)
Let's talk
(Just you and me)

About a kiss
(Kiss)
And a touch
(Touch)
I want you so much
(So much)

And now you got a serious hold on me
And everything you do is alright
And, ooo, I'll be gentle, I'll be careful
Yes, I will

Listen
I don't mean to be sweating you
All I wanna do is just talk to you
All I wanna do is just talk to you
All I wanna do is just talk to you
All I wanna do is just talk to you

Baby, I'm in love, can I have your attention?
There's something on my mind that I'd really like to mention
There's so many things that I need to express
Like how I long for your love and your tender caress

I'll take you slow, baby, I won't speed you
'Cause you know I need you
I'll cook, clean and feed you
I'll climb the highest mountain
And you know I'll scream and shout
So baby, please, can we talk about it?

Let's talk about it
Let's talk
(Let's talk about it, babe)

About the birds
And the bee's
(You and me)
Sugar, you and me, getting it on

Let's talk about it
(I like the way it's going down)
Let's talk
(Just you and me)
About a kiss and a touch
I want you so much

Let's talk about it, baby
