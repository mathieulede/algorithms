In My Songs

Introduction: Hello, This is Eddie Levert, I want to thank you all for loving and supporting my son throughout his career. He had just finished this album when we went to South Africa. And he was extremely proud and anxious for everyone to hear his newest collection. It is with his wish and mine that I proudly present the one you all nicknamed "The Teddy Bear", my son, Gerald Levert and his new album "In My Songs"

If I could only find a lover to sing about

Oh, oh yeah See I know what I want
Something real, something I can feel
And I know it don't come easy
I wanna be with somebody who can share my ups and downs (ups and downs)
And when they're feeling bad I can be the one to make a smile (make a smile)
Make her realize that I'm the special guy I sing about

(If I could only find her) If I could only find her, a love, I'm searching, I'm searching here and there and everywhere (if I could only find her) find, if I could find a love to sing about when I
