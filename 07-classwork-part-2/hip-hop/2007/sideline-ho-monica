Ho,Ho,Sideline Ho, You's a ho, you's a ho, sideline ho

(Verse 1:)
When you called his phone, did he pick it up Noooooooooo, cause we was makin love. Did you meet his moms, have you met his kid noo ooh o, did you know my kid was his

(Chorus:)
Get your shit together your makin a fool of yourself yeah, it don't matter if he spends the night his home is somewhere else, Ain't you tired of being on the side line, tired of getting yours after I gets mine, baby second place don't get a prize, when you gonna realize you wasting your time, baby ain't you tired of him gettin in , hittin it real quick then rollin, and ain't you tired of you need a little change and he lie about what he holdin, ain't you tired of spending all the holidays alone, tired of being his little sideline ho

(Verse 2:)
Do he take you out, do he foot your bills, noo ooh o, cause I know what his balance is, have you been to his church, do he ask you to pray, noo ooh o, cause Sundays family day

(Chorus)

Do you got benefits, no, credit cards, no, house keys, no, then you's a sideline ho, do you get pillow talk, no, held at night, no, if you don't make his breakfast you's a sideline ho

(Chorus)
(Repeat 3x's)
You's a ho, you's a ho, sideline ho
