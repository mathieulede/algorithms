[Intro]
Yeaa! Yeaa!

[Hook]
She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name, then you get her number
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer
Then you get some brain in the front seat of the Hummer

[Verse 1]
Gucci, let me set the record straight:
Hater: you participate
3 girls with me like I'm going on Elimidate
Say you got a man, but your man ain't here
The ice in my ear shine like a chandelier
Jumping out the phantom, don't you think I'm handsome?
Watch on my wrist cost more than a mansion
Bet your baby-daddy ain't icing like the kid be
Got your baby mama front seat of my Ferrari

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Gucci, Gucci Mane La Flare. Baby, I'm that guy
Girls' eyeballs pop when they see when my Lamb' pass by
My money long as a limo
Just to show off, I put my wrist out the window
I ride through the 6, little kids scream "bingo!"
I fell off in the spotlight, ay, lets mingle
Then the DJ play my new single
The club got crazy, all the girls went psycho

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Gucci! Don't be conceited, girl
I know you're freaky, girl
I know your secret, girl
But I'm gonna keep it, girl
Oh, you's a college girl?
Go on and be a Gucci girl
Oh, you's a Gucci fan?
Let's go to Gucciland
You dig a Gucci man
Cause only Gucci can
Drop a rack, pop your back with a rubberband
You diggin Gucci, Gucci
Let's do the oochi-coochi
Oh, that's your girlfriend?
Why don't you introduce me
