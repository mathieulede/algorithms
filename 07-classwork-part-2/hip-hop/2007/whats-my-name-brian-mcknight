Tell me when was the last time
You were truly satisfied
And if I'm wrong then
Tell me that it wasn't with me
Thought it's been a good while
Girl you know I'm still qualified
To lay hands on your body like it
Used to be
…And OOOOOH

I didn't know you were missin' me
So much, girl you knew what
Would happen when we touched
I'm not in a hurry there's no rush
And I'm not gonna stop
Til' you get enough

What's my name? can you say it?
What's my name? stop playin'
What's my name? I need to hear it
What's my name? can you feel it?
What's my name? so excited
What's my name? that you like it
What's my name? I need to hear you say it

See I know what you want
Girl you know I aim to please
I could put in less work but
That's not my style…Yeah
Pushin' past real good
Takin' you to ecstasy
When it's all said and
Done I wanna see you smile
Oh how I long to see you smile

I didn't know you were missin' me
So much, girl you knew what
Would happen when we touched
I'm not in a hurry there's no rush
And I'm not gonna stop
Til' you get enough

What's my name? can you say it?
What's my name? I'm not playin'
What's my name? I need to hear it
What's my name? can you feel it?
What's my name? so excited
What's my name? that you like it
What's my name? I need to hear you say it

Baby all I want to do is put a
Smile upon your face
Make it last so that it
Cannot be erased

When you want this to stop
Just let me know
Gonna take it nice and slow
I'm gonna tell you that
I'm also Glad you came
And I hope you feel the same

Every time you want
You know where to go
