[Verse 1]
Nothing can make you high
Or put fire in your eyes
Or give you a chance to fly
When you need the wings
When all that you've got is doubt
And nothing can stop you from feeling down

[Pre-Hook]
But oh, I know, I know exactly how you feel

[Hook]
But can you believe now
When you're on your knees now
Begging and pleading now
Can you believe
When all that you've got is doubt
And no one to pull you out
When your heart is slowing down
Can you believe?

[Verse 2]
See the person I love the most
Is so far away tonight
And no other medicine or promise is
Gonna heal me up right
But I got to believe
That her and me
Will be together
Cause that's all I got

[Pre-Hook]
And oh, I know, when you're down at the bottom
Can you believe?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Can you believe when all hope seems gone
When your mother and father can't keep you safe from harm
Can you forgive in your heart?
Can you ask for forgiveness
When nobody else believes?
Can you believe?
Can you believe in yourself?

[Hook]

[Outro x6]
If nobody's watching
You will never know
