I see you lookin at me
Tryin to figure out how I move to the beat
So good
Guess I got in my blood
Everytime the dj spinnin cut
Gets busy, gets busy on the one
I came to party
Just to show you how it's done
Fellas you can 2 step if you want too
B5 giving you something to move to

(Chorus)
Bumping your trunk
Let the speakers bump
Hit the switch on the 6 4 make it jump
Gota brand new dance
Can you see me stunt
You can do it like me just turn it up
Get low

Bring it up slow

So sophisticated, educated
Standing in the crowd
Cuz she looking at me
Cuz she like the way I put it down
She recognise me from my video
And all my shows
I told her it's my taste
And this is how it goes
Gets busy, gets busy on the one

Just to show you how it's done
Fellas you can 2 step if you want too
B5 giving you something to move to

(Chorus)
Bumping your trunk
Let the speakers bump
Hit the switch on the 6 4 make it jump
Gota brand new dance

You can do it like me just turn it up
