[Verse 1:]
I Notice Everytime When We're Out Together - And You See Some Hottie
Passing By You Quickly Turn Your Head (Uh Uh)
Don't Try To Shake It Off Say Whatever - Baby I Ain't Blind
Cuz I'm Not Trying Blame You

[Trans-Chorus:]
What's On Your Mind? - What Turns You On? - Cuz Baby It's Ok
You Know I Love You And Tonight - We're Gonna Play

[Chorus:]
I Wanna Be With You - Turn The Lights Down Low - Pull My Shirt Up
Slow
Open The Buttons One By One - And Watch You Come Undone
I Wanna Be With You - From My Skin Tight Jeans To The Lingerie
Tonight I'm Gonna Be - Every Woman - In Your Fantasy

[Verse 2:]
Switch Your 2-Way Off And Light The Candles
Put The Slow Jam On
Cause All There Is Is You And Me Here
Baby Lean Back Make Yourself Comfortable
Take Your Shoes Off Loosen Your Tie
Cause You Ain't Going Nowhere Tonight

[Bridge:]
Let Me Cook A Little Something For You
It's My Kitchen And I Know What Im Gon Do
Work The Dough With Extra Care - Add A Little Spices Everywhere
Steam The Meat With Wine And Juices
Turn Up The Heat - No Excuses
Whip The Eggs And Prepare The Candies
Taste The Flavors Make Sure It's Ready

[Chorus X2]
