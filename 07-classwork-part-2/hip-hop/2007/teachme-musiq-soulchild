[Verse 1]
I was told the true definition of a man was to never cry
Work till you tired (yeah), got to provide (yeah)
Always be the rock for my fam, protect them by all means
And give you the things that you need, baby
Our relationship is (Suffering). Trying to give you (what I never had)
You say I don't know how to love you, baby. Well I say, show me the way
I keep my feelings deep inside, I shadow them with my pride
I'm trying desperately, baby just work with me

[Chorus]
Teach me how to love. Show me the way to surrender my heart
Girl, I'm so lost, teach me how to love. How I can get my
Emotions involved. Teach me, show me how to love
Show me the way to surrender my heart
Girl, I'm so lost, teach me how to love. How I can get my
Emotions involved. Teach me, how to love

[Verse 2]
I was always taught to be strong, never let them think you care at all
Let no one get close to me, before you and me
I done shared things with you girl about my past that I never tell
To anyone else (no), just keep it to myself (yeah)
Girl, I know I lack affection and expressing my feelings
It took me a minute to come and admit this but, see I'm really tryna
Change now, wanna love you better, show me how
I'm trying desperately, baby please work with me

[Chorus]
Teach me how to love. Show me the way to surrender my heart
Girl, I'm so lost, teach me how to love. How I can get my
Emotions involved. Teach me, show me how to love
Show me the way to surrender my heart
Girl, I'm so lost, teach me how to love. How I can get my
Emotions involved. Teach me, how to love

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody ever took the time to try to teach me what love was but you
And I ain't never trust no one enough to let them tell me what to do
Teach me how to really show it and show me how to really love you baby
(Teach me, please just show me) cause I'm (willing) to let go of my fears
Girl I'm (serious) about (all that I've said) Girl I (wanna love you)
With (all of my heart) Baby show me where to start

[Chorus]
Teach me how to love. Show me the way to surrender my heart
Girl, I'm so lost, teach me how to love. How I can get my
Emotions involved. Teach me, show me how to love
Show me the way to surrender my heart
Girl, I'm so lost, teach me how to love. How I can get my
Emotions involved. Teach me, how to love

[Outro]
Teach me, how to love you baby
Girl you just teach me how to love you better
You know I wanna love you better girl
