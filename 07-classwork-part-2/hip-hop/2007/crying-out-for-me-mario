You keep on going in circles girl you’re trying to find your way out
But its time I put on my cape and
Put that s on my chest

But I’m stuck in the middle of seeing you hurt
I know when you love him
And you wanna make it work
And I can’t help but think that I've known you first
It’s getting louder, girl
Can’t ignore it no more

[Chorus]
I can hear your heart crying out for me (crying out for me)
