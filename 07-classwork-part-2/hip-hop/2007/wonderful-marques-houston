Trauma burning up my mind
She's a spot in the shade
Thirsty for her all the time
She's my cold lemonade

If there was a way i could put it, make it
So that you could understand
That im only half a man without her (oh no)
Gonna give my all, my heart, my mind, my soul, take it
Ain't no other word that can describe it
Baby baby you are

Wonderful
Your style, your vibe, your body
Amazing
Ohhhh just gotta tell somebody
Wonderful
Hey! to put it simply you are
Everything (everything babe)
Youre so wonderful

Music to my melody
You are where i belong (yeah)
Girl together you and me
We're a beautiful song

If there was a way i could put it
Make it
So that you could understand
That im only half a man without her (yeah)

Gonna give my all, my heart, my mind, my soul, take it
Ain't no other word that can describe it
Baby baby you are

Wonderful
Your style, your vibe, your body
Amazing
Ohhhh just gotta tell somebody
Wonderful
Hey! to put it simply you are
Everything (everything yeah)
Youre so wonderful

Baby let's be up on the moon
Lets watch the stars get
Jealous of your shine (hey babe)
Nothing that better for me (nothing better baby)
Girl everything is too wonderful

Wonderful
Amazing (so amazing baby)
Wonderful (to put it simply you are)
Everything (everything girl)
Youre so wonderful

Wonderful
Amazing
Wonderful
Everything
Youre so wonderful
