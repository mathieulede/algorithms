[Intro]
Yeah, you know what's funny
Seems every time I try to forget about you
My feelings pull you back in
You know, cause I got somebody else
And you got somebody else
But you and I both know what it really is
But still, you know what I'm sayin' B

[Verse 1]
Ran across a picture you took of me and it got me thinkin'
Bout how we used to be
It was just you and me
Still hear you say you love me, put no one else above me
But that was back then, now you're just a memory
If I didn't go away to school then where would we be
Probably still together and somewhere happy
If I'm supposed to be moved on, in a new relationship strong
Then why are you still hauntin' me

[Hook]
They say if you love something let it go
And if it comes back then that's how you know
I got to the stop light then I made four rights
Now I'm back where I started and you're back in my life
The further I go the closer I get back to you
I say I moved on til' I'm reminded of you
Can somebody help me
Help me get out of this circle
Out of this circle

[Verse 2]
I drove past your house the other day
I didn't even mean to, I went the wrong way
I ain't seen your mama in a while
When she looked at me she smiled
And asked me if I'm doin' okay
Took everything I had not to bring up your name
And wonder if you came home for the holidays, yeah
She asked if I could stay awhile cause you had come in town
And you were just five minutes away

[Hook]
If you love something let it go
And if it comes back then that's how you know
I got to the stop light then I made four rights
Now I'm back where I started and you're back in my life
The further I go the closer I get back to you
I say I moved on til' I'm reminded of you
Can somebody help me
Help me get out of this circle
Out of this circle

[Verse 3]
Now everybody that's listenin' to this
If you got that person that makes you wonder, "what if?"
Let me hear you say yeah, say yeah
Say yeah, oh yeah
If you understand how I feel
Then grab that person, gotta let them know what's real
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah hey

[Hook]
If you love something let it go
And if it comes back then that's how you know
I got to the stop light then I made four rights
Now I'm back where I started and you're back in my life
The further I go the closer I get back to you
I say I moved on til' I'm reminded of you
Can somebody help me
Help me get out of this circle
Out of this circle
