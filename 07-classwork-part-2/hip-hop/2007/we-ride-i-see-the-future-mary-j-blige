Just can't help it
I love my hun
All that I need
And all that
I want

Said I
Just can't help it
I love my hun
All that I need
And all that I want

Everybody asking
"Why Mary ain't mad no more?"
It seems
Like a question
That I've already answered
Like too many
Times before
Now ladies
If you got a man
And he treat
You real good
Ain't you gon' flex
Every chance
That you get
Now ain't you gonna
Love him
Just like you should
Especially when you
Never thought
You would
Yeah
Oh you know
That I'm
All into the feeling
And I never
Look to lose it
Oh for sho'
This is consistent
With you
I find a rhythm

From the day
To the night
We ride
We ride

The future baby
You and I
Better with time

And it is
What it is
And I
Just can't help it
And I felt
What I felt
No
I just can't help it
I see the future, baby
Me and you
That's how we do

I got a song
In my heart
That's all
That I need
I sing it
A cappella
I sing it
To the beat
What we are
Is classic
You know it
Because your
Attitude shows it
Now fellas
If you got a girl
And she treats
You right
Ain't you gonna spend
Every dollar, every cent
Eh
Ain't you gonna make sure
She stay fly
Especially when
She's reppin'
You for life

From the day
To the night
We ride

You are mine
I told you before
I wouldn't lie
I need you
And more
Gotta stay
With you
I am safe
With you
Let me
Repeat it
In case you forgot
Love is a mountain
And we're
At the top
Yeah
Breath and strength
Cause I see
The future in your eyes
