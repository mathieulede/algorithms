[Spoken]
I know you usually don't hear me talk like this
But I got a little game that I want to play
Are you ready?

[Verse 1]
When I think about you…
I think about giving myself to you
Cause you know I want you babe
And…
I will do anything
I know your thinking the same thing babe

So come and get it, get it (come and get it)
I'm so excited
I can't hide my feelings (I can't hide my feelings) Get it
I won't stop until we start over and finish (finish)
Tonight it's all about my baby
I'm feenin for you get me high
I can't stop you feel me right?

[Chorus#1]
Close the door
Bed or floor
I just want more
I can't get enough of you
What I got in store
It's all of yours
I just want more
I can't get enough of you

[Chorus#2]
Close the door
Bed or floor
I want more
I can't get enough of you
What I got in store
It's all of yours
I just want more
I can't get enough of you

[Verse 2]
When I think about us
I think about the way that we make love
The way that you make me sweat
Make me want a cigarette
And I ain't no smokin' chick
But you got me wantin' it
So don't stop (Yeah)
You making me high (Ohhhhh)
I feel it right there (Yeah)
We tossing and turning
So keep it right there (Yeah)
My adrenaline is pumping right
Stomach muscles getting tight
Skin so wet my finger slides

Gone take you to a place
You ain't never been (Again and again, want you to feel it baby)
Ohhh ohhhh

I'm bout to handle my business that's (You…)
Make sure you handle Meee too

[Chorus#4]
Close the door (ooh)
Bed or floor
I just want more
I can't get enough ( I can't get enough baby) of you
What I got in store
It's all of yours
I just want more
I can't get enough of you

[Chorus#5]
Close the door (ooh babe)
Bed or floor
I just want more
Cause I can't get enough of you
What I got in store
It's all of yours
I just want more
Cause I can't get enough of you

Come back baby, who's gonna be first to get loud
I know you'll lose after the second round
Then the consequence, maybe, that you'll have to switch to third round and make me scream like when I put it down (now)

Put on a little show
To let you baby know
By then I should be screaming uncontrollably
Hope your ready to stay up
One time is not enough (One time)
Cause nothings too much baby
You're just what I want baby

[Outro]
Close the door
I want you
I need you baby
Baby what I got in store
Oooo it's all yours
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Baby I just want to play
Until you take my breath away
Do you feel me
I know you do
Cause I feel you too
I can't get enough of you
Oooh
Cause I can't get enough of it
It's all, all yours
I just can't get enough anymore
When everything is over
We'll start over again
This time we'll make it last
Won't end
No no
I just want it
I can't get enough of you
