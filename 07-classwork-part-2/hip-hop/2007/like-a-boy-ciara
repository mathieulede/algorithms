[Verse 1]
Pull up your pants (Just Like Em')
Take out the trash (Just Like Em')
Getting ya cash like em'
Fast like em'
Girl you outta act like ya dig
(What I'm talkin' bout')
Security codes on everything
On vibrate so your phone don't ever ring
(Joint Account)
And another one he don't know about

[Pre-Hook]
Wish we could switch up the roles
And I could be that
Tell you I love you
But when you call I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me?
Like where you be at?
Cause I'm out 4 in the morning
On the corner rolling
Doing my own thing
Oh

[Hook]
What if I
Had a thing on the side
Made ya cry
Would the rules change up
Or would they still apply
If I played you like a toy
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

[Chopped & Screwed] x2
Can't be getting mad!
What You Mad?
Can't Handle that!

[Verse: 2]
Girl go head and be (Just Like Em')
Go run the streets (Just Like Em')
Come home late say sleep like em'
Creep like em'
Front with ya friends
Act hard when you're with em' like em' (What)
Keep a straight face when ya tell a lie
Always keep an air-tight alibi
(Keep Him In The Dark)
What he don't know won't break his heart

[Hook]

[Chopped & Screwed] x3

[Bridge]
If I was always gone
With the sun getting home
(Would Ya Like That?)
Told you I was with my crew
When I knew it wasn't true
(Would Ya Like That?)
If I act like you
Walk A mile off in yo shoes
(Would Ya Like That?)
I'm messing with your head again
Dose of your own medicine

[Hook]

[Chopped & Screwed] x4

[Outro]
If I played you
Would yo like that?
Had friends...
Would you like that?
Never call?
Would you like that?
Hell naw
You wouldn't like that
No!
