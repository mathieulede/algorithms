[Intro:]
There's only one [repeat x4]
You're the only one [repeat x2]

[Verse 1:]
My baby
He's the perfect ten
(Perfect ten)
He punches in at 9:00
Ate the breakfast that I made for him
Hops in the seven
He get six figures

When he gets off at 5:00
I'm glad he's hungry for three letters
And I'm in the mood
(In the mood)

And he's the only man that I give it to
If ya man don't be stressing
Ya need to count your blessings
Ladies, let me see them hands now
Help me with this countdown

[Chorus:]
Ten
So many reasons why I stick with you
Nine
And my body adore you cause of the things you do
Six
If I let you go, I'm a fool
Cuz, boy, there's only one u

Five
Said I never wanna let you go
That's from my heart
Four
Ever and ever
Just to be with you
That's what I want

Three
No, I never wanna leave
Your love is too good to me
Two
There's never a wrong you can do
That's why there's only one u

[Verse 2:]
I count the seconds till he's at my door
I kissed his lips
At least a thousand times before
Still get that feeling

My knees get the trembling (my)
My head start to spinning (my)
He's one and a million to me
And he don't have to say a word
(Don't say a word)

When he gets me with a dozen roses
I know I got a winner
So if you got a winner
Ladies, let me see ya hands now
Help me with this countdown

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Seeing me without you by my side
So many reasons why
I'm your girl and youâ€™re my guy

You're all I need
You're all I need to get by
Like Method Man and Mary Blige
You don't have to wonder why

[Repeat Chorus:]
