It's been a hell of a week
Have work and
Boss keeps yelling at me
What a dirt and

Home is killing me too
It's the worst calls
Kids done got out of school
On my nerves and

Come down, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
I'm going now
Ooh, I'm going now

I'm popping cows, chopping dollars
It's the weekend

I wanna dance, got my hands, see some mashing
DJ, don't play no slow jam

I wanna dance, got my hands, see some mashing
DJ, don't play no slow jam
After the club I'll make love my own way

Come down, Monday, Tuesday
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
I'm going now
Ooh, I'm going now

I'm popping cows, chopping dollars
It's the weekend
Can't stop me now
Ain't nobody stop me now

DJ, don't play no slow jam
I wanna dance
