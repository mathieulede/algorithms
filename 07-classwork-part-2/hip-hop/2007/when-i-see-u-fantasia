[Verse 1:]
I put your picture on my mirror
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach
There's a pain

See you walk in my direction
I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand
But my knees go weak

What's happening to me?
Anybody can you tell me what it means?
I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
Is this the reason why

[Chorus:]
You're always on my mind
When you come around
I get shy
When I see u, when I see u

Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see u, when I see u

[Verse 2:]
I scribble X's and O's in my notebook
Checking how my hair and nails look
I feel myself in the zone
I get nerves when you call
So I say I'm not home

I see your face
When I hear my favorite song
Should I send a email at home
You're the number one topic on the phone
I wonder if you know
Or do you have a clue?

I lay my head on my pillow
You got me staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
What's the reason why?
Yeah

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Something now is taking over me
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm not gonna run
I'm, just gonna stand here and see
Ooooo, yeah

[Repeat Chorus x2]
