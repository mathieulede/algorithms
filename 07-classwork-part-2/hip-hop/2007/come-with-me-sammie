[Verse 1]
Oh no no
I know you think it ain't my place, to say how I feel
But I'm going to say it anyway, cause I gotta keep it real
I know you're tired of tryin', to make it be
Something that's truly not (truly not)

Girl it kills me everyday to see you in tears
And it amazes me the way, you put up all these years
You be tweaking, tryna' make it work
But you keep ending up hurt, oh baby listen to me

[Chorus]
You don't have to wait, I can ease your pain
You don't have to be left out in the rain
Don't you just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it, come with me

You don't have to stay up, waiting by the phone
You don't have to ever feel like you're alone
Don't you just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it, come with me, yeah

[Verse 2]
You're the type that always said, you don't need a man
Who's gonna make you're heart stop, over and again
And now you're telling me that you're ok
But you don't realize you're getting more pain than gain
And I ain't never been, the kind to steer you wrong
If you trust me as your friend, then trust me with you heart, girl
It'll take a lot to understand you need yourself another man, woah

[Chorus]
You don't have to wait, I can ease your pain
You don't have to be left out in the rain
Don't you just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it, come with me

You don't have to stay up, waiting by the phone
You don't have to ever feel like you're alone
Don't you just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it, come with me, yeah

[Bridge]
Don't give up girl (Don't give up girl)
Don't give up girl (Don't give up girl)
Don't give up girl, you don't have to do it baby
Don't give up girl (Don't give up girl)
Don't give up girl (Don't give up girl)
Don't give up girl, you don't have to do it baby
Don't give up girl (Don't give up girl)
Don't give up girl (Don't give up girl)
Don't give up girl, you don't have to do it baby
Don't give up girl (Don't give up girl)
Don't give up girl (Don't give up girl)
Don't give up girl, you don't have to do it baby

[Chorus]
You don't have to wait, I can ease your pain
You don't have to be left out in the rain
Don't you just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it, come with me

You don't have to stay up, waiting by the phone
You don't have to ever feel like you're alone
Don't you just say you're fed up, tired of love
Whatever you need, I got it, come with me, yeah

[Outro]
Oh baby, don't give up on love, shawty
Because I'm here, I'm here
