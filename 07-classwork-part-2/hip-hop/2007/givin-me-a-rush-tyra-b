[Chorus:]
You're giving me a rush, rush
Everytime that you come around
And we touch, touch
I can't get enough

You're giving me a rush, rush
Everytime that you come around
And when we touch, touch
I can't get enough

[Verse 1:]
Tell me all your secrets
I won't tell a soul
I'll keep it on the low

Just tell me what you do
That makes me want to lose control

We got a special thing
Can't let nobody come between

I know you're feeling
Hope you're feeling the same way
That I feel

[Hook:]
They'll never understand the way I feel
Wonder why we're so affectionate
Why, why?
Just tell them that it's human nature
[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
It doesn't matter who's around
Or where we are
Baby, it feels like we're alone

You take me places
No one's ever taken me before

You ain't gotta say it (you ain't gotta say it)
Cause I know what you're gonna say
Baby, can you send it
Just rush (rush) your love right away

[Repeat hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Take me
Away from here
So far away

Baby
Something about the way
When you touch me
You make me feel so free

[Repeat Chorus:]
You're giving me
You're giving me
