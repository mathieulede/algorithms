[Intro: T-Pain]
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Broke up with my girl last night so I went to the club
Put on a fresh white suit and the mini coupe sittin on dubs
I'm just lookin for somebody to talk to and show me some love
If you know what I mean... uh-huh
E'rybody jockin as soon as I stepped in the spot
Two hundred bitches and I'm bettin ain't none of them hot
Except for this pretty young thing that was workin all the way at the top
Shawty what is your name?

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Oh she made us drinks, to drink; we drunk 'em, got drunk
And then I think, she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that
We hit it off somethin proper like

[Hook: T-Pain]
I like the bartender (oh if you're lookin for me)
I'm at the bar, with her (uh-huh, okay)
I like the bartender (yeah, if you're lookin for me)
I'm at the bar with her (ohhh uh-huh, okay)

[Verse 2: T-Pain and Akon]
Got a brand new girl so I'm feelin all good inside
Feel like I put some brand new 24's on a brand new ride
Triple shot of Patron on the rocks with a lil' bit of lime
I'm just keepin it real... uh-huh
Baby still workin at the club so I'm gettin in free
Wednesday night I'm on the list T-Pain plus three
E'ry time I hit the spot babygirl taking care of me
How do you think I feel?


[Bridge: T-Pain]
Oh she made us drinks, to drink; we drunk 'em, got drunk
And then I think, she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that
We gon' have fun at my spot tonight

[Hook: T-Pain]
I like the bartender (oh if you're lookin for me)
I'm at the bar, with her (uh-huh, okay)
I like the bartender (yeah, if you're lookin for me)
I'm at the bar with her (ohhh uh-huh, okay)

[Verse 3: Akon]
Shorty I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out
Unless I'm in the M6 doin tricks freeway burnt out
Got a passenger side that's empty wantin it to be yo' spot
Put you on my Billboard we can act like the charts I can end up on top
Don't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby
Just lookin at you from a distance, lookin like a God damn star baby
So my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car?
'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorr'

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Oh she made us drinks, to drink; we drunk 'em, got drunk
And now I know, she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back (uh-huh)
And then I think that (uh-huh) we gon' have fun at my spot tonight

[Hook]
I like the bartender (oh if you're lookin for me)
I'm at the bar, with her (uh-huh, okay)
I like the bartender (yeah, if you're lookin for me)
I'm at the bar with her (ohhh uh-huh, okay)
