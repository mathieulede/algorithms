Yea, I feel sexy right there
Yea, feel it all this way

B. McKnight, with Tim & Bob
This is not another love song

See, I know what you're thinkin'
You're feelin' like a lucky guy
I was the same way
'cause she was hard to come by
I was on her so hard
That I almost lost my hustle
So go 'head, playboy, do your thing
Don't be mad if she calls my name

Walkin' around, sportinn' her, holdin' her hand
Doin' it big like you're the man
But she was my girl
She used to be my girl
I must admit that she's a 10
Bet she didn't tell you about way back when
When she was my girl
She used to be my girl

See, I know how you're feelin'
I used to be in your shoes
So calm down with the attitude
You're just a next somebody new
You never know how much she's feelin' you
So be happy that you got her
Don't know much about you, dude
Sorry, I gotta break the news

She's still thinkin' 'bout me
And I'll tell you why
She couldn't even hold her head up when you walked by
Well, don't go hatin' on me
It's just a game
You want her, you got her
Take her, you got her
To me it's all the same

Walkin' around, sportin' her, holdin' her hand
Doin' it big like you're the man
But she was my girl
She used to be my girl
I must admit that she's a 10
Bet she didn't tell you about way back when
When she was my girl
She used to be my girl

Walkin' around, sportin' her, holdin' her hand
Doin' it big like you're the man
But she was my girl

She used to be my girl
I must admit that she's a 10
Bet she didn't tell you about way back when
When she was my girl
She used to be my girl

Erotic, exotic
You must admit she's got it
She used to be my girl
Sexy with talent
Built like a stallion
She used to be my girl
You got her so flaunt her
Know everybody wants her
She used to be my girl
'cause you might not be the only
So never leave her lonely

She's still thinkin' 'bout me (she's still thinking 'bout me, and looking here)
And I'll tell you why
She couldn't even hold her head up when you walked by (hey, yea)
Don't go hatin' on me
It's just a game
You want her, you got her
Take her, you got her
To me it's all the same

Walkin' around, sportin' her, holdin' her hand
Doin' it big like you're the man
But she was my girl
She used to be my girl
I must admit that she's a 10 (she used to be down with me)
Bet she didn't tell you about way back when (she used to be a freak for me)
When she was my girl (we used to hold hands, she used to understand)
She used to be my girl (she used to be down with me)

Walkin' around, sportin' her, holdin' her hand (she used to take trips with me)
Doin' it big like you're the man (she used to wiggle her hips for me)
But she was my girl (she used to lick her lips for me)
She used to be my girl (she used to, she used to)
I must admit that she's a 10 (she used to, she used to)
Bet she didn't tell you about way back when (she used to be my girl)
When she was my girl (she used to be my girl)
She used to be my girl (she used to be my girl)

Yea, yea, yea, yeaa, used to be my girl [x3]

Walkin' around, sportin' her, holdin' her hand
Doin' it big like you're the man
But she was my girl
She used to be my girl
I must admit that she's a 10
Bet she didn't tell you about way back when
When she was my girl
She used to be my girl
