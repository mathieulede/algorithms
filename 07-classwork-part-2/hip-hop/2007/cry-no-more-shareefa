You know what this is already, man
It's something quite phenomenal, man
Your boy, Darkchild, Def Jam, DTP, let's go
I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
And I can't keep thinking about you
Too many things in my mind beside you
I seen things deeper than you
And I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
Over all the times you play me
Over all the stress and mess I don't need
Over all the stuff that hurt me
And I just can't cry no more
Now there you go just buggin' out
That's why I'm so through with you
Can't be playing games with you
Because the craziness come with you and I just hate it
You'll never stop to think about all hardship I done seen
People shot in front of me
And I thought you change everything
But you playing the same
And I, I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
And I can't keep thinking about you
Too many things in my mind beside you
I seen things deeper than you
And I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
Over all the time you play me
Over all the stress and mess I don't need
Over all the stuff that hurt me
And I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over, you, you, you, you
Over, you, you, you, you, over, you, you, you, you
Just can't cry no more
Now every time I think about all things you put me through
What was I suppose to do?
I was in love with you and I was falling
And you know what you was doing to me
When them broads would run their mouth
How you have them up in my house
You don't deserve me, shut your mouth
Save the talk, I'm out
And I, I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
And I can't keep thinking about you
Too many thing in my mind beside you
I seen things deeper than you
And I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
Over all the time you play me
Over all the stress and mess I don't need
Over all that stuff that hurt me
I could never be sucker woman who scorn
I've been fighting heavy since the day I was born
'Cause baby I'm a rider, I'm a soul survivor
I could never be sucker woman who scorn
I've been fighting heavy since the day I was born
'Cause baby girl's a rider, I'm a soul survivor
I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
And I can't keep thinking about you
Too many things in my mind beside you
I seen things deeper than you
And I just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over you
Over all the time you play me
Over all the stress and mess I don't need
Over all that stuff that hurt me
And I just can't cry no more cause I'm over, you, you, you, you
Over, you, you, you, you, over, you, you, you, you
Just can't cry no more cause I'm over, you, you, you, you
Over, you, you, you, you, over, you, you, you, you
Just can't cry no more 'cause I'm over, you, you, you, you
Over, you, you, you, you
