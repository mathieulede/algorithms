Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete

Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believin' you
You don't what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
And now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened
There is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died
So long ago

Oh, I'm screamin' out at my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worse
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen
I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start, but I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you'll think you gave to me
But now I gotta find my own
My own
