(extended version)
Get me off
I'm your bomb getting ready to explode
I need you to get me off
Be your slave do anything i'm told

Chorus:
I'm a sex shooter
Shootin love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come on play with my affections
Come on kiss the gun
Guaranteed for fun

I need you to pull my trigger baby
I can't do it alone
I need you to be my main play thing pillar of stone

Chorus:
No girls body can compete with mine
No girls rap can top my lines
No girls kiss can ring your chimes
Come on boy lets make some time

Chorus
I'm a sex shooter
Shootin love in your direction
I'm a sex shooter
Come on play with my affections
