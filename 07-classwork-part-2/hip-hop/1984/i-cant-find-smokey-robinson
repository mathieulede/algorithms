Every now and then
Somebody comes into my life
Oh, and for a little while, it seems
They're the answer to my dreams to my prayer

As sudden as they come, they start to fade
Like floating smoke rings
Oh, how can they stay with me when
They're only penciled in
Though you're gone, you're always there

I can't find my way to a very special somewhere
I can't find myself, 'cause without you, I'm just out there
I can't find that person, I wanna put that much in
I can't find anybody like you, who makes touchin' more than touchin'

Take me in your arms, hold me close, I need to feel you
Oh, to me there's nothin' like your touch
It's what I need so much, oh yes, I do, my love

So I say all my love, if you can find it in your heart
To do just one thing for me, come back
Come back, come back, come back
Come back, come back, come back

I can't find sleep at night, I'm either watchin' TV or walkin'
I can't find any conversation that means more to me than talkin'
I can't find satisfaction, even when I do surrender
I can't find anybody like you, who makes tender more than tender, oh

I've been lookin', there's just nobody around, oh, no, no
No sense lookin' for who can never be found

I can't find anybody like you who gets my full attention
I can't find anybody who means enough for me to mention
I can't find that person, who makes me wanna surrender
I can't find anybody like you, who makes tender more than tender

I've been lookin', there's just nobody around
No sense lookin' for who can never be found, yeah, yeah

I can't find, I can't find, I can't find
