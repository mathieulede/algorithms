Hit it!
We'd like to dedicate this record to all the DJs in the entire world
And all the ladies sing along
(chorus)
Hey DJ just play that song
Keep me dancing all night (x3)
Hey DJ just play that song
Keep me dancing all night long!

Now thank DJs, MCs, cable TV, and radio station personalities
For the new tunes we here today
Playing clear across the nation
And thank them for country, funk, jazz
And disco records of the past
We're living in a time of rock n roll
Hip-Hop, new wave, and classical
Come on everybody turn your dial
Up and down down and up find your sound
Get you face off the tube
And let em make you
Dance you out your doggone shoes
Scratch out the beat
Excuse me while I dance!
(chorus)
Hey DJ I must confess
And when you mix with your arms your feet head your mouth knees and feet
Boy you're smoother than Doctor Jay
You didn't come to the party in a limousine
Yet your cuts are fresh and your raps are mean
Take your two turntables and a microphone
And keep em (dancing)
Keep em dancing all night
(chorus)

Hey don't forget about me man!
And who are you son?
I'm the street DJ!

Thank DJs that rock in the street
For rockin the funk and for rockin funky
For scratching the beat and for scratching the drum
While the MC's rocks to the microphone
Rockin the house is what it's all about
I know just like that you can turn it I'll rock
You never lost a battle you never won an award
But one thing's for sure
You're always down by law!

*Instrumental break*

You say you wanna be a DJ?
What must you do to be a DJ?
You gotta make them
Dance you out your doggone shoes
(chorus)
Where are all the DJs?
Well they're locked England playing in the club
In the USA on cable TV
On your radio stations and out in the streets
Rockin the house with the greatest of ease
So when you come to the spot rock to the top
For the DJ rocks the beatbox
(chorus)
You know what Jeff?
It's a pity that she's so dirty
She's only dancing just to be friendly
So friendly she drives me loco
The girl's so silly she makes me love sooo-
No no no see man that's our last record
That's already been a hit

Hey DJ (x4)
