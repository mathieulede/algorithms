Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

I've been watching you
Just to see how far you would go
You're gonna have to prove
Make a move and let it show

I know it's getting late
And you gotta go home
But before you go, baby just

Show me, show me what I gotta do
And baby, if you love me
(You love me)
I'll do anything for you, show me, oh, oh

It's hard for you and me
To put our feelings on this play
But if you look into my eyes
You'll know why I feel this way, baby

I know it's getting late
And you gotta go home
But before you go, baby just

Show me, show me what I gotta do
(My sweet babe)
And baby, if you love me
(You love me)
I'll do anything for you, show me

Oh baby, come on and
Show me, show me what I got to do
(Show me)
Baby, but before you go
(You love me)
Come on and show me

I know it's getting late
And you gotta go home
But before you go, baby
Ah, open up and let me in, baby, yeah

Show me, show me
And baby, if you love me
