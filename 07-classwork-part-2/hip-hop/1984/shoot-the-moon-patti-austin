Pressure slowly buildin' like a sky about to rain
Somethin' so electric in the air
All this time we?re killin' only leads us back again
To the feeling that?s been waitin? for us here

It?s too late to be cautious
If it?s a mistake, it?s one we?re meant to make

Shoot the moon
?Cause one heart is the most we can lose
And if we shoot the moon
There?s no way that the stars can refuse

Feel the tiger stalkin? in the jungle of the heart
Hungry for the tender and the warm
We can keep on talkin? but as long as we?re apart
The feelin' just can?t break into a storm

Take a chance when the music is playing
You dance, there?s no reason we can?t

Shoot the moon
?Cause one heart is the most we can lose
And if we shoot the moon
There?s no way that the stars can refuse

Finding you here
Had the odds of a million to one
And you?re the one
Now, it?s up to us to finish what fate has begun

Take a chance when the music is playing
You dance, there?s no reason we can?t

Shoot the moon
?Cause one heart is the most we can lose
And if we shoot the moon
There?s no way that the stars can refuse

Shoot the moon
(There?s nothin' standin' in our way)
?Cause one heart is the most we can lose
And if we shoot the moon
(It?s just the chance we have to take)
There?s no way that the stars can refuse

Shoot the moon
(There?s nothin' standin' in our way)
?Cause one heart is the most we can lose
And if we shoot the moon
(It?s just the chance we have to take)
There?s no way that the stars can refuse

Shoot the moon
(There?s nothin' standin' in our way)
?Cause one heart is the most we can lose
And if we shoot the moon
(It?s just the chance we have to take)
There?s no way that the stars can refuse
