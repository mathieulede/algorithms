[Verse 1]
Ump, ump, ump, so you can see we're back into this same old mess
Seems like everytime we get out of one situation we're back into it all over again
All you people that watch you talk, you better get it together or we won't get it done
We sit down while you cuss and fuss, but guess who's suffering, nobody but us
Now we're a deticated people and we do our job
But the harder we work the game gets hard to beat
One for all and all for one but it's harder to play when you can't have fun

[Chorus]
Heeeeeeeeeey, you talking out the side of your neck
Heeeeeeeeeey, you're gonna get what's comin to you yet
You carry the weight but we carry the force and thats ain't fair So stop rockin the boat
You think you get away with political crimes
But don't take this for granted
Just get out of my house
Now some of the people some of the times but not all of your people all of the time
Trick you get, bored too
General Matt Conrad, Ronnie Reagon too

[Chorus]
Heeeeeeeeeey, you talking out the side of your neck
Heeeeeeeeeey, you're gonna get what's comin to you yet
You carry the weight but we carry the force and thats ain't fair So stop rockin the boat
You think you get away with political crimes
But don't take this for granted
Just get out of my house
Now some of the people some of the times but not all of your people all of the time
Trick you get, bored too
General Matt Conrad, Ronnie Reagon too

[Chorus]
Heeeeeeeeeey, you talking out the side of your neck
Heeeeeeeeeey, you're gonna get what's comin to you yet
You carry the weight but we carry the force and thats ain't fair So stop rockin the boat
You think you get away with political crimes
But don't take this for granted
Just get out of my house
Now some of the people some of the times but not all of your people all of the time
Trick you get, bored too
General Matt Conrad, Ronnie Reagon too
