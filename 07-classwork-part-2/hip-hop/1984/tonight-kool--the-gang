Tonight, ooooh
This is the night you'll see the light
Tonight, ooooh
This is the night you'll see the light

My 16th birthday I was so shy
Not yet a man but ready to try
Music playing people swaying
I looked around, oh, she caught my eye
Smoke-filled room I couldn't hardly see
There she was moving closer to me
She told me her name before I could speak
Took my hand and then she said these words to me

Tonight, ooooh
This is the night you'll see the light
That's what she said me
Tonight, ooooh
This is the night you'll see the light

Hey beautiful girl so lovely tonight
Show me the way show me the light
Music playing people swaying
Next thing I knew we started to groove
Dancing and dancing moving so free
A feeling of love had come over me
I held her close and knew it was right
What a birthday surprise I had finally seen the light

Tonight, ooooh
This is the night you'll see the light
Tonight, ooooh
This is the night you'll see the light

Tonight, you will finally see the light baby
Tonight, you will finally see the light baby
Tonight, you will finally see the light
You will see, ooh you will see the light
Tonight you will finally see the light
Ooooh yeah

Oh come on I want to dance with you
Oh come on I want to dance
Oh come on I want to dance with you
Oh come on I want to dance with you
