For your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Verse 1:]
This time I'll follow how my heart feels
'Cause it's going with the thoughts in my mind
The vibes are right, so baby, let's get started
Come on, let's stop wasting my time
Tell me what you want

[Chorus:]
I'm waiting for your love
(I really need you)
My body's burning for your love
(Stop this fire)
I'm waiting for your love
(To come to me, and I don't want no substitute)

[Hook:]
For your love
(I will let you have me baby)
For your love
(Any way you want)
For your love
(There's no limit on the love I give)
For your love
(For the love I get from you)

[Verse 2:]
It's alright for me to love you, baby
Just as long as I know you love me back
So think about loving me creatively
Use your mind, heart, body
Don't hold nothing back
Kiss and hold me
Whisper sweet nothings in my ear
To help me keep my passion flowing
Ooh, I'm ready now!

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for your love
(I really need you)
My body's burning for your love
(Stop this fire)
I'm waiting for your love
(To come to me)
Tell me what you want
I'm waiting for your love
(I really want you)
My body's burning for your love
(Stop this fire)
I'm waiting for your love
(To come to me)

[Hook]

[Ad-libs:]
I need your loving
Give it to me baby
I want your loving
Ooh, today

[Bridge:]
All the time I felt I was in love before
I never felt this kind of feeling
That you're giving me
(For your love)
Your sweet love, baby
Has opened up my heart
Now every beat is yours

[Chorus]


For your love
(I'm waiting for your love)
Ooh, I really need you
Stop this burning sensation, ooh baby
Let's start a fire, ooh baby
I've got to have you

For your love
(I really need it)
For your love
(I really want it)
Give it all to me
I want it, I got to have it

[Chorus] (2x)

It's alright

[Chorus]

I need it, baby
Let's get the thing going
I want you
Come on and give it all to me
I really need you
