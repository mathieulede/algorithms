[Intro]
Holiday
Celebrate
Holiday
Celebrate

[Chorus]
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice

[Verse 1]
Everybody spread the word
We're gonna have a celebration
All across the world
In every nation
It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come together
To release the pressure
We need a holiday

[Chorus]
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice

[Verse 2]
You can turn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days
Put your troubles down
It's time to celebrate
Let love shine and we will find
A way to come together
And make things better
We need a holiday

[Chorus]
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice

[Bridge]
Holiday
Celebrate
Holiday
Celebrate

[Chorus]
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be, it would be so nice

[Outro]
Holiday
Celebrate
Holiday, celebration
Come together in every nation
