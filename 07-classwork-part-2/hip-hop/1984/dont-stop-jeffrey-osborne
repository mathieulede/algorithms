Baby, don't stop
Baby, don't stop

[Verse 1:]
Everytime I look at you
My heart starts dancing
And every little thing you do is entrancing

You open up a door
I never knew before
You leave me wanting more

[Chorus:]
Don't stop
When the love's gone crazy
Never thought I'd ever be san
Baby, don't stop
My whole world has gone crazy
I can't fight this feeling anymore

[Verse 2:]
I was on the telephone
It's so frustrating
Hanging up and all alone

Anticipating
The magic of your touch
That warm electric rush
You keep me rising up

[Chorus:]
Don't stop
When the love's gone crazy
Never thought I'd ever be sane
Baby, don't stop
My whole world has gone crazy
No use fighting this feeling anymore

Don't stop
When the love's gone crazy
Never thought I'd ever be sane
Don't stop
My whole world has gone crazy
I can't fight this feeling anymore

Baby, don't stop
Baby, d n't stop

[Bridge:]
Oh
Baby, don't stop
You open up a door
I never knew before
You leave me wanting more

[Chorus:]
Don't stop
When the love's gone crazy
Never thought I'd ever be sane
Baby, don't stop
My whole world has gone crazy
I can't fight this feeling anymore

Don't stop
When the love's gone crazy
Never thought I'd ever be sane, baby
My whole world has gone crazy
I can't fight no baby
Oh no, baby

Don't stop
You leave me wanting more
And more and more
Don't stop, baby
Baby, don't stop

Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
