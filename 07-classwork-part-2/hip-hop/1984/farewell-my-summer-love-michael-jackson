Ooh, farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh
I found my happiest days
When you came to see your grandma in may
I bumped into you by the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye, bye, don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh, yeah
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down?
Or someone that you don't forget, no?
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye, bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah
Ooh, farewell, farewell
Ooh, farewell, farewell
If you remember my name
(Drop a line)
Drop a line sometime, yeah, yeah, ooh
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl oh yeah
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, farewell yeah, yeah, yeah
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell
