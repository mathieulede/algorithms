You know you had me
With your sensuous charm
Yet you looked so alarmed
As I walked on by
In awsome wonder
You had to know why i did not respond to carry on

Chorus:
Love me in a special way
What more can I say
Love me now
Love me in a special way
What more can I say
Love me now (love me now)

Cause Im special
Not the average kind
Who'd accept any line
That sounds good
So reach into your chain of thoughts
Try to find something new
Because what worked for you so well before
For me it just won't do

So reach into your chain of thoughts
Try to find something new
What works so well with you before
For me it just won't do

So reach into your chain of thoughts
Try to find something new
What works so well with you before
For me it just won't do
