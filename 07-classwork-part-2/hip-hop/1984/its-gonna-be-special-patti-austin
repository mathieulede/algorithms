I've seen the many shades of love in my life
Until I met you no one shined so bright
Some say that passion can't survive for very long
But I get this feeling you and I can make them wrong

'Cause it's gonna be special
This love for you and me, just wait and see
It's gonna be special
It's written in the stars and here we are

It's gonna be special
Gonna be special

I promise

We'll find a way to keep the thrill in our touch
We'll have tomorrow 'cause we know there's no rush
Out in the street we'll feel the beat of our hearts
The night is ours, so let the celebration start

'Cause it's gonna be special
This love for you and me, wait and see
It's gonna be special
It's written in the stars and here we are

It's gonna be special
Gonna be special

Darling, I've been waiting for you, now that you are here
It is extraordinary, boy, and is it clear
Special, gonna be special

'Cause it's gonna be special
This love for you and me, just wait and see
You know it's gonna be special
It's written in the stars and here we are, here we are

Gonna be special
This love for you and me, that's the way it's gonna be
It's gonna be special
It's written up in the stars, baby, baby, here we are

It's gonna be special
This love for you and me, you gotta wait, you gotta wait and see
It's gonna be special
It's written up in the stars and you know here we are, here we are

It's gonna be special
Gonna be special
It's gonna be special
