I-I-I-I.....can´t get off my high horse
And I can´t let you go
You are the one who
You are the one who makes me feel
So real
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh! What am I supposed to do
Oh! What am I supposed to do baby
When I´m so hooked up on you
Then I realise
Oh I realise
That you are somebody else´s guy
Oh yeah
Why you wanna do this to me boy?
(Ooh ooh ooh
Somebody else´s guy)
Can you remember the times we spent together
Sharing our days in the sun
Then I found out that you were somebody else´s
Lover
After all the plans we made, now were shattered
Still I can´t get off my high horse
I can´t let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh what am I supposed to do
When I´m hooked so on you
Then I realise that you´re somebody else´s guy
That day in September, I´m sure you can remember
That´s when all the stuff hit the fan
You told me a lie and you didn´t have an alibi
But baby yet I still cared
You know I loved you so baby that I can´t let go
No, no
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh what am I supposed to do
When I´m hooked so on you
And realise you´re somebody else´s guy
You know I loved you so baby that I can´t let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh what am I supposed to do
When I´m hooked so on you
And then I realise that you´re somebody else´s
Guy
(Oh I can´t get off my high horse and I can´t
Let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do when I´m hooked so
On you
And realise that you´re somebody else´s guy)
(Oh I can´t get off my high horse and I can´t
Let go
You are the one who makes me feel so real
Ooh, what am I supposed to do when I´m hooked so
On you
And realise that you´re somebody else´s guy)
I, I, I, I can´t let you go no
See you are the one who makes me feel so real
What am I supposed to do
When I´m hooked so on you
Then I realise that you´re somebody else´s guy
