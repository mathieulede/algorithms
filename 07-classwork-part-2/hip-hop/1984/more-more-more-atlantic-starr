Hey, there mister
So it seems again we meet
The first time we met it was crazy
You swept me off my feet

I still imagine your lips, boy
Kissing me here and there
Ooh
And if my hands could touch your body
They'd caress you everywhere

I want you to love me down, oh
Let's go for what we know
Hold me so tight
Then love me some more

Fine, fine fella
Where do I begin?
I guess I should start
By telling you, sugar
That you're the perfect ten

Let's find a nice warm cabin
Way up on some hill
Then you and I
Will close up the world around us
And do the things we feel

Won't you come on, boy
And love me down
Yeah
And let's go for what we know

Hold me so tight
And then love me some more
Oh, oh, oh

Love me down
Yeah
And let's go for what we know

Hold me so tight
Yeah
And then love me some more, more

Ooh, never before have I felt this way
And how I feel about you
Is crazy I must say

But one thing's for sure
I know it feels good
So come on
Love me, boy
Oh, I wish you would

Boy
This must be my lucky day
And I'm so glad
The wind that blew you in was heading my way

Oh, come on, boy
And love me down
Yeah
And let's go for what we know

Hold me so tight
Yeah
And then love me
Love me
Love me down

Love me down
I go crazy when you love me, baby
Love me down
I go crazy when you love me, baby
Love me down
Ooh, love me down
Baby, yeah
