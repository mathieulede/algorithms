We come together, we're on tonight
It doesn't matter if the feeling's right

We're always in control
Never letting go of this off and on love
Baby, off and on love
You know we got this off and on love
Off and on love, whoo!

When we choose to, we can turn it off
No use staying if the feeling's gone

We're always in control
Never letting go of this off and on love
Baby, I ain't gonna let go
(Off and on love)
No, I won't let go
Off and on love
It's the way we feel
Off and on love

(Why)
Ooh, tell me why
(Do people seem to need)
They say they need love as security
Ooh, not with you and me
Off and on, my love
Oh, baby, off and on, my love

Our friends wonder just what it is
That keeps us wanting nothing permanent

We're always in control
Never letting go of this off and on love
Off and on love
Shoo-bop, shoo-shoo-ba-doo-wop
Off and on love
Off and on love, yeah

(Off and on love)
When we choose to, we can turn it off
(Off and on love)
Ain't no use staying if the feeling's gone
(Off and on love)
Never letting go of this off and on, my love
(Off and on love)
Baby, off and on, my love

Off and on, my love

Off and on love
When we choose to, we can just turn it off
Ain't no use in staying if the feeling's gone
Off and on love
Our friends wonder just what it is
That keeps us going strong
What we don't want nothing so long

Off and on love
Off and on love
Off and on love
Off and on love...
