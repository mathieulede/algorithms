Push the Button
(Hook)
Are we going to take control
Or are they going to take control our lives

(Repeat Hook)

Push the Button
Verse1

Computer Age is now
Everyone must have a machine
They say it going to make life easier
Well I can't stand it.(echo)

They say we should put them in control
Well maybe we should give them a soul

I guess we must might think that we're gods

Our willness will be never. (echo)

I know the Lord cannot be to glad
In fact i'm sure he must be quite mad
To seeus take this world vrom our lives
And give it to Computers

For him, we sit in our easy chairs
As Owa Suszi sign our well fare

Who will suffer, Who will Survive
It's up to the Computers

Push The Button

(Repeat Hook)

Push The Button!!!
