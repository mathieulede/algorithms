I believe (something's on your mind)
There's something on your mind
Tell me, tell me
Just lay it on the line

I believe (something's on your mind)
There's something on your mind
Tell me, tell me
Girl, stop wasting time

You've been acting kinda strange on me lately
Is there something on your mind?
I seem to get the feeling every time I'm near ya
That I'm running out of time

How can you walk away and leave me hanging?
Just leave me hanging on
I know there's something going on
You just can't hide it
Now tell me that I'm wrong

Girl, you can see what's on your mind
We can talk it over
There is no need for you to hide
What you feel inside your heart

(If something's on your mind)
(Just lay it on the line)
(If something's on your mind)
Tell me
(If something's on your mind)
Tell me girl
(Just lay it on the line)

Girl, sure wish you would state the situation
What you're taking me through
But baby, I can't imagine what I'd do without you, girl
Let me know
If someone else has taken my place inside your heart
Don't disappear on me without a trace

Don't you know?
Don't you know I believe?
(Something's on your mind)
That something's on your mind
Tell me tell me
Just lay it on the line
I believe
(That something's on your mind)
That something's on your mind
You better
(Just lay it on the line)

Love is a feeling that we share
We belong together now
I can understand
How you and me can give up on love
Whoa girl, you can say what's on your mind
We can talk it over
There's no need for you to hide
What you feel inside your heart

(Something's on your mind)
I know, I know
Sooner or later
(Something's on your mind)
I know that something's on your mind
I got the strange feeling
That something's on your mind
(I know I know)
Sooner or later

Something
Something's on your mind
Won't you tell me?
Won't you tell me what it is?
Won't you tell me?
(Something's on your mind)
I know, I know
Sooner or later
(Something's on your mind)
