[Verse 1]
A man came around in the neighborhood
And he promised to take you to Hollywood
That's what he said, he played with your head
And then he skipped town with all your bread
Got hit by a car, fell to the ground
And people all over start to gather around
And he was hurt so bad it seemed to be
But he was only down for the currency, huh
Ladies at the corner looked so fine
And man oh man I wish she was mine
I mean she looked so cute with the skin tight suit
But she was selling that body as a prostitute

[Pre-Hook]
Well it might sound sad
Or it might sound funny
But thats what people do for money

[Verse 2]
My man doing bad, commit a crime
But they caught him in the act, now he's doing time
And I asked him why, with tears in his eyes
He said I did it for the M O N E Y
Huh I got no money and times getting rough
I'm on Public Assistence, but that ain't enough
I got to get a gun and stick up someone
And later be sorry for what I've done, huh
A girl got married against the law
She married a man she never seen before, huh
And then she split, ain't that a myth
Cause it was all done for Citizenship

[Pre-Hook]
Well it might sound sad
Or it might sound funny

[Verse 3]
Teenage girls dating senior citizens
I said tell me girl, what's happening
She says I'm down on my luck, so what the f...
I'll see if I can lay him for a couple of bucks
Three cards in my hand, one red, two black
You know red is making money, Black, you make nothing back, huh
You took a try and now I'm sorry
You lost all your money in three card molly
One dollar in your pocket, and now you're broke
But you're dying from hunger and you need a smoke, huh
You play a three to win eight to one
You lost your only dollar now you have none
Huh it might sound sad
Or it might soung funny
But that's what people do for money
Put 40 hours in at a minimum wage
Friday here, and you get paid, huh
You played some dice
And now you're paying the price
Huh you got to tell the story to your wife,huh
50 dollar sneakers and you got no job
Tell me how you do it when times are hard huh
You rob the bank and make big cash
But tell me, how long does that life last

Or it might sound funny
