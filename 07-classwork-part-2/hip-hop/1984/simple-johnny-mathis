I know someone's done you wrong
But girl you've cried too long
It's time to live again
I won't try to complicate your life
I'm not that kind of guy
But I think I ought to tell you
Love is

CHORUS:
Simple
Easy as 1 2 3
That's how love should be
All you gotta do is trust in me
Cuz it's
Simple
Just like the birds and bees
It's simple biology
So don't you wanna fall in love with me?

You've got to find
A new place to begin
It's time you let love in
Girl, what are you waiting for?
This time there'll be no sad good-byes
No teardrops in your eyes
Girl I'm gonna make it beautifies

(Repeat chorus to end)
