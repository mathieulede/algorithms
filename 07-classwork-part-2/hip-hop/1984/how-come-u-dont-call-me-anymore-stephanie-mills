I keep your picture beside my bed
And I still remember everything u said
I always thought our love was so right
I guess I was wrong
I always thought u'd be by my side
Mama, now u're gone

What I wanna know baby, what we had was good
How come u don't call me anymore?
Yeah

Listen
I still light the fire on a rainy night
I still like it better when u holding me tight
Now, um
Everybody said, everybody said that we should never part
Ooh yeah
I always did think we looked kind of cute together myself
Say to me baby, baby, baby, why, why u wanna go and break my heart?
Why'd u wanna do it?

All I wanna know baby, what we had was good
How come u don't call me anymore?
Why don't u call me girl?

Sometimes it feels like I'm gonna die
If u don't call me, mama, girl, u gotta try
Down on my knees beggin' u please, please

Why can't u call me sometime baby, yeah

Just one lousy dime, baby
Why can't u call me sometime?
Oh, no, no
Why on earth can't u just pick up the phone? Yeah
U know I don't like bein' alone
Why?
Why must u torture me?
Why u gotta torment me so?
