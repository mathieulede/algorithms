Ooh... hoo...
Ho... ho...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

As the sun sets and the night goes around
I can feel my emotions comin' down
But now I pull the covers off my bed
Saying to myself, "Tonight I'll forget"

Tears, tears
Falling like the rain
Tears, tears
Another heart knows my pain

Tears, tears
All the tears your heart wouldn't hide
Tears, tears
Now the tears become a good cry

If I could go back and change the hands of the clock
My heart would be sinking when you heard it tick-tock
For the one that I love has gone far, far away
It gets harder and harder to face another day

Tears, tears
Falling like the rain
Tears, tears
Another heart knows my pain

Tears, tears
All the tears your heart wouldn't hide
Tears, tears
Now the tears become a good cry

Every night
When I lay my head down to sleep I hope and pray
That this will be the last time I weep

I've heard it said
That a man is not supposed to cry
He ain't supposed to cry
But love is blind
And you will see that it's the reason why I cry

Tears, tears (Ho, ho, ho)
Falling like the rain (Tears)
Tears, tears
Another heart knows my pain

Forget, forget
I keep saying to myself
But realizing
That there'll be nobody else

Tears, tears
Falling like the rain
Tears, tears
Another heart knows my pain

Tears, tears
All the tears your heart wouldn't hide
Tears, tears
Now those tears become a good night cry
