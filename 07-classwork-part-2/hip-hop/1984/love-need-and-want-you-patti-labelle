[Verse 1:]
I love you
I love you
Honey, I love you
I do

More than you ever know
It's for sure
You can always count on my love
Forever more

I need you
I need you, baby
I need you right now
Say, can you understand
Your my man and my one desire
Is keeping you satisfied

[Bridge:]
Baby, when we
When we're together
Say I'm alright and you're alright
It's like paradise
I just want you to know how I feel
How I feel

[Verse 2:]
Oh, I want you
I want you, sugar
I want you so bad

I got a burning desire
My soul's on fire
Can't you see
You are my everything

[Repeat Bridge:]

Oh, I love you
I love you
Honey, I love you
I do

More than you ever know
It's for sure
You can always count on my love
Forever more

I love and need and want you baby
I love and need and want you baby
I love and need and want you baby
Love and need and want you baby

I love and need and want you, baby
Love and need and want you, baby
You can count on me forever more

I love
And I need
And I want
You

I got this burning desire
My soul's on fire
You can't count on me forever more

I love
Baby, I need
Baby, I want
Your love

Oh I love you
I need you
You can always count on my love
Forever more
