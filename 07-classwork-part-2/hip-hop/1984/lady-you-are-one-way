I've been with you for a while now
And you're still so nice
Not like all the others I've been around
Who love to fuss and fight

You've changed in no way
You're always at your best
I love your style, your personality
You're better than the rest

You're so considerate when it comes to me
I'm so glad to have you
So splendid you are to me
I love your everything

'Cause you're a lady
Lady you are
You're a lady
And I'm so proud of you

You're so sweet and innocent
In all the things you do
Not to mention your lovely smile
So plentiful and true

You've changed in no way
You're always at your best
I guess that's why I really love you
You try so hard for me

Multitude, self gratitude
You deserve in every way
Astonishing you are to me
I love your everything

'Cause you're a lady
Lady you are
You're a lady
And I'm so proud of you

Lady, lady

You're a lady
Lady you are
You're my lady
And I'm so proud of you

I wouldn't know what to do with myself
If I ever lost you, no, no
I love the way you carry yourself
'Cause you're a lady

I-I-I don't wanna lose you, no
'Cause you're a lady
Lady, I'm so proud of you

You're better than the rest
You're a lady
I love the way you carry yourself
'Cause you're a lady

I-I-I-I don't wanna lose you, no
