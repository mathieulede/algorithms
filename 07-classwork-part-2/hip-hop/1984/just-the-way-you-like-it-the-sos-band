You have been single for a long time
And I don't wanna cramp your style
Still you insist you want to settle down
But I know better
You can't change years overnight
And asking that, I would never do
So here is the solution that comes to mind

As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it

I have never had a guy
Who has as many girls as you
But numbers cannot take the place of quality
I have no doubt
By this decision to see us through
And my love is so strong for you
And by your side I always will remain

As long as I can be your number one
You still can have your fun
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
Until you settle down
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it

Just the way you like it
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Just the way you like it
Ooh-ooh...

If you plan on loving me for a lifetime
It doesn't matter what you do
With other girls, they just can't change your mind
(Oh, no)
'Cause when you're tired of them
You'll come back to me
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I won't tie you down
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You can play around
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
'Cause you know where the best love is found
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Right here

As long as I can be your number one
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...)
You still can have your fun
(Ooh-ooh...)
Whenever you need love
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it
You keep your other girls
(Oh-oh)
Until you settle down
('Til you settle down)
Whenever you get bored
I will give it to you
Just the way you like it

(As long as I can be your number one)
Anyway you need it
(You still can have your fun)
Anyway you want it
(Whenever you need love)
Anytime, anywhere
