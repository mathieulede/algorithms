Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe you'll get over
Try and luck might
Come your way

Here I am on a cloud
If you want me
Take the chance
Cry
Love
Out loud

As I drift through the sky
Shooting Cupid's loving arrow
You just might try
But don't miss me
Take your time and aim

Cause you've only
Got one chance
I think you better touch

Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe you'll get over
Touch a four leaf clover
And luck might get you over

Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe you'll get over
Try and luck might
Come your way

Like the wind
I am free
Going places
Being things I wanna be

To settle down
Is, oh, so hard
But I will grant you that one chance
Pick the right card

But don't miss it
Take your time
Pick it
You only got one chance
You'd better

Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe you'll get over
(Maybe you'll get over)

Touch a four leaf clover
Luck might get you over
(It just might get you over)

Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe you'll get over
Try and luck might
Come your way

I'm free as a bird
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To catch me
Is to catch a leprechaun

Hold on to your rabbit's foot
And I just might be yours forever
But you'd better

Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe you'll get over
(Maybe you will get over)

Touch a four leaf clover
Luck might get you over
(It might get you over)

Touch a four leaf clover
Maybe you'll get over
(Try it)
Try and luck might
Come your way

Touch a four leaf clover
You might get lucky
You just might get me

You, yeah, oh
Just might get lucky
Touch a four leaf clover
You never know
Maybe you'll get over

Come on, baby
Touch it
Cause you just might do it

Like the wind
I am free
But you know I think you
Just might be the one for me

So come on and touch it
(Touch a four leaf clover)
Touch that four leaf clover
(Maybe you'll get over)

Ooh, babe
Oh, babe
Just might get lucky
