Come, if you got real love for me
Stay away, if got games and tricks for me

I wanna man that means everything he say
And not a boy full of play
Pulling rabbits out of his hat everyday
Oh, Baby I'm scared of you

I... I don't believe in magic (magic)
I believe in love everlasting
I can't understand that

Houdini, Houdini, was great magician
He could crack a lock, from any position

But my heart, is nothing like those locks
And your falling last of my brand of stock
Like little red riding hood, you're the fox
Oh baby I'm scared of you

I... I don't believe in magic
I believe (I believe) in love ever lasting

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I... I don't believe in magic
I believe (I believe) in love ever lasting

Don't go pulling no rabbits out your hat
It'll be all I want from that
Baby now I can't go for that

I can't understand that baby (naw naw)
I can't understand that baby

You ain't no Houdini
Ah, I know I ain't

I can't understand that baby
Oh, Like Rudolph Valentino
I can fall down on my knees
Pull flowers out my sleeve
Because I know you will be pleased,I wonder

I can't understand that baby
I can't understand that
Look, I can pull flowers out my hat
Do a disappearing act
Come back on you so strong
Girl I really turn your loving on,I wonder

I can't understand that baby
I can't understand that
I need a man
I'm available

Mean everything he say
Don't need a boy full of games and tricks everyday
I can't understand that baby (naw naw)
I can't understand that
