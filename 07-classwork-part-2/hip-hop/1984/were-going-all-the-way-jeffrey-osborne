[Verse 1:]
We’re just beginning
And I know we’ve each been
Down this road a time or two
And never could make it through

But I’ve got this feeling
That we’ve stumbled into
What we’ve both been waiting for
And maybe even more
It doesn’t matter where we’ve been
Cause this time I know for sure

[Chorus:]
We’re going all the way
(All the way)
Headed far forever
And that’s where we’re gonna stay

The more you’re near me
The more I know it
We got it all here
If we just don’t blow it

We’re going all the way
(All the way)
If the two of us both want it
I’d lay my money on it
Starting today
(Starting today)
We’re going all the way

[Verse 2:]
I know for certain
That there’s more than magic
In these feelings that we found

We’re standing on solid ground
But now we’re both ready
Ready for the real thing
Cause our dues have all been paid

We’ve finally got it made
Believe me
When I tell you there’s no need to be afraid

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
We’re gonna weather all the showers
And hold together
Through whatever comes
I know we got the staying power

We’re gonna make tomorrow ours
If we just stick with it
And give it all we’ve got to give it

[Chorus:]
We’re going all the way
(All the way)
If the two of us both want it
I’d lay my money on it
Starting today
(Starting today)
We’re going all the way
Mmm, hmm

Oh, oh
Baby, we’re going all the way
(All the way)
If the two of us both want it
I’d lay my money on it
Starting today
(Starting today)
We’re going all the way

Mmm, mmm
Hmm, hmm
Ooh, hoo
