Loving spirit
Loving me
Love in silence
Loving me
The sweetest sound of love
The sweetest murmur of motion
Go where you will
Angel of the kiss
Heaven sent you to me
Heaven sent you to me
Blue birds
The sky light up
Heart felt
A little fire fly light
And you will be
Something special
You are the key to everything
You renewed me
You blessed me
Heaven sent you to me
Heaven sent you to me
