[Chorus:]
You're the best thing yet
To ever come into my life

[Verse 1:]
An understanding hand
When the world calls me grand
You protect my heart
Right from the start

Sensitive vibes
Are strong and true
The very best
I've always shared with you

And if I should fall
Or if I'm stading tall
I can see you standing there
Always willing to share
Each and every part of me
You see things I never, never see

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Verse 2:]
Deep down in my mind
I wonder at the blessing that I could find
Someone as loving as you
Could bring into my life
This feeling so right and so true

Like the flowing waters of a sliver stream
And like the misty vision in a midnight dream
Such a wonder of life to me
So rare is found such a reason to be

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Bridge:]
Like the flowing waters of a silver stream
And like the misty vision in a midnight dream
Such a wonder of life to me
So rare is found such a reason to be

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Repeat x2:]
You're so wonderful
You're so beautiful
You're the best thing yet
To ever come into my life
