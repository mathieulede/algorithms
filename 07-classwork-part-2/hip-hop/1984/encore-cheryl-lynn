Chorus:
Your love so good deserves an encore
(Your good love deserves an encore)
Your love so good deserves an encore
(Your good love deserves an encore)

Going to a show tonight
After working hard 9 to 5
Not talking about a movie, no
Or a Broadway play, this show is live

And I know it's you I want to see tonight
Want to see you tonight
I'll buy my ticket at the door if it's alright
So your show can make me feel good again

Repeat Chorus

I can give you rave reviews
You sold out my heart with love
And every time that I'm with you
Boy, you take control, I'm your captive audience

And I know it's you I want to see tonight
Want to see you tonight
I'll buy my ticket at the door if it's alright
So your show can make me feel good again

Repeat Chorus

Can't get enough, ooh
Of your gentle loving touch
I can't get enough
So intense, it drives me nuts
Makes me want to break it down now

Feels so good, feels so good
It deserves an encore
