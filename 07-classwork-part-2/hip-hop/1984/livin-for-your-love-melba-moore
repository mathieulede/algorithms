I got rid of what was loneliness
When I found you made my heart beat fast
Took my breath away
I didn't know exactly what to do
But I had to make the moment last
And tempt you here to stay
Now I know it's you that I want
And you I need
Beside me
Baby, baby
I know it's real
Life's complete
With this love
That you're givin'
Hold me all night
Just all night
Cause I'm livin' for your love
Oh baby
Gonna give you all I've got
And she's got alot
I'm just livin' for your love
I'm just livin'
Got me livin' for your love
No more going to a restaurant
Where the people sit for just for one
It's much more fun for two
They say that good things come to those who wait
But I can't wait another day to give my love to you
Now I know it's you that I want
And you I need
Beside me
Cause you know baby
I know it's real
Life's complete
With this love
That you're giving
Hold me all night
Just all night
Cause I'm livin' for your love
Ooo baby
Gonna give you all I've got
And she's got alot
I'm just livin' for your love
Got me livin'
Got me livin' for your love
I'm just livin'
I'm just livin' for your love
And you know I need it and I'm livin' it baby, yeah
Oh baby, gonna give you all I've got
All I've got (and she's got alot)
I've been livin' for your love
Got me livin'
Ooo baby, aww baby, yeah baby
I'm just livin' for your love
Yeah, ooo baby
I'm just livin'
Ooo baby
Yeah baby, ooo baby
