Now you know we've been through a lot today
That's why we need to just sit back
And enjoy this evening
So if you'll choose me and you're my choice tonight

Right tonight, you're my choice tonight
You really got me, yeah, feeling right
Look out, girl, sure gon' be a heavy night

Choose her, beg her, what's your pleasure, girl
In the evening when the day is done
Why don't you ease back, honey
And let me be the one

To hold you, just to know you, girl
There's got to be a way
All the signs we go, easy, soft and slow
So how can we no, when

Feels so right, you're my choice tonight
It's you, baby, you, you, baby
What delight
Down right heaven like

Take this love, let it fly, oh girl, in the midnight sky
I said you got me, baby, feeling right
You're my choice tonight
Yes, you are, yeah

Come on, choose me, baby
Ooh, choose me, baby
Come on and choose me, baby
Would you do that, would you do that for me?
I did sound so good

I got love inside, made with us in mind
And it's ready to be tried
It's an all night plan for love makin'
As much as we can stand, ooh girl

Feels so right, you're my choice tonight
What delight, down right heaven like
Why don't you take this love
Let if fly, in the midnight sky
Feelin' right, you're my choice tonight

Come on and choose me, baby
Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby

Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby

Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby

Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby

Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby

Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby
Choose me, baby
