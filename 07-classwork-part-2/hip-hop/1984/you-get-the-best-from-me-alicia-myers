Hey Mr. Goodbye, you know who you are
You're my sugar, sugar, sugar-coated baby
Honey, you're my star

I've traveled many miles just to find someone like you
And no way I'm gonna give you up
Cause I know you feel the same way too

Say say say say, say say say say
Say say say say, say say say say

Say Mr. Goodbye, you know who you are
You're my sugar-coated, baby
Honey, you're my star

I've traveled many miles just to find someone like you
And no way I'm gonna give you up
Cause I know you feel the same way too

Say say say say, say say say say
(You get the best of me)
Say say say say, say say say say
(You're all these eyes can see)

Now, my thirst for love ended
When my heart suggests about you
That's when I knew you were Mr. Right for me
The more I'm with you, the more I feel that it is true
Keep on loving me, I love the way you do

I've traveled many miles just to find someone like you
And no way I'm gonna give you up
Cause I know you feel the same way too

Say say say say, say say say say
(You get the best of me)
Say say say say, say say say say
(You're all these eyes can see)

Say say say say, say say say say
(Don't you know you get the best of me)
Say say say say, say say say say

Say say say say, say say say say
(Get the best)
Say say say say, say say say say
(I've traveled a mile to find someone like you)
Say say say say, say say say say
(You know you get the best)

Say say say say, say say say say
Say say say say, say say say say
Say say say say, say say say say
Say say say say, say say say say

Say say say say, say say say say
Say say say say, say say say say
Say say say say, say say say say
(Sugar-coated, baby)
(You get the best from me)

Say say say say, say say say say
(You're my sugar-coated, baby)
Say say say say, say say say say
(Don't you know you get the best)

Say say say say, say say say say
Say say say say, say say say say
(You're my star, Mr. Goodbye)

Say say say say, say say say say
(You, you are, you are the best)
Say say say say, say say say say
(You, you are, you are the best)

Say say say say, say say say say
(You, you are, you are the best)
Say say say say, say say say say
(You, you are, you are the best)

Say say say say, say say say say
(You get the best of me)
Say say say say, say say say say
(You're all these eyes can see)

Say say say say, say say say say
(Don't you know you get the best from me)
Say say say say, say say say say
Say say say say, say say say say
(Best from me, the best from me)

Say, say, say, say, say, say, say, say
(You get the very best, Mr. Goodbye)
