You make many promises
And they sound so sweet
Talk like yours
Will knock most any girl right off her feet

When will you deliver?
Words can’t warm my night
Conversation’s nice
But I need a man to hold me tight

Some days you just don’t have to say it
(Say it, say it, say it, say it)
Cause sometimes words get in the way
So don’t give me your lines

I want action
Oh, so tough
Action
If you really want my love

Like the way you think
The way you speak your mind
You want to get together
Well, that suits me just fine

You call me up to tell me
The things you’d like to do
You and I got time for love
But never follow through

You set me up, oh, so tough
(So tough, so tough, so tough)
Now I’m craving your love
It’s time to show your head

I want to see action
Show me the real deal face to face, oh
Action
Got to know if you can keep up the pace

Don’t say one thing
And do another
Don’t put yourself in the middle of a minefield
And then run for cover

Action
It’s your move
Action
Put it into action
Let’s see what you can do

Action
Action
Action
Action
Action

Action
Action
Action
Action
Action

Cause everybody needs love

And I want action
I’m all talked out
Action
Tell me what you’re all about

They say that action speaks louder than words
Now tell me
Are you gonna go for what you know
Or stand there looking absurd?

Action
It’s up to you, got to put it into
Action
Got to follow through
Uh, huh, uh

Can’t control temptation
Much to my surprise
You’re driving me crazy
I can’t help but speak my mind

I’m so fascinated
You’re making me come alive
So come on now, baby
I wanna be with you tonight

Action

It’s up to you
You know what I wanna do
I’m all talked out
Tell me what you’re all about

Ah…

Action
It’s up to you
Action
You know what I wanna do

Action
I’m all talked out
Action
Tell me what you’re all about
