Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

I have opened up my eyes
Now I can see clearly
You told there's no other guy
Who would be as good to me

I fell in love
And didn't stop to think what you were doing
But now I know
I don't need you at all, you're no good for me

I've changed my mind
I'm takin' back my love

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

I would never let you down
So you began to use me
You were always afraid of my
Female sensitivity (And you knew that)

I do my best to give you what you want
And you abuse me
It's time you go
I'd rather be alone without the heartache

I've changed my mind
I'm takin' back my love

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Ohohoho
Change of heart
You made me change my mind, yeah, yeah
I'm takin' back all the love I gave to you, baby

Ohohoho
Yeah, you, yeah, you
Yeah, you!

Ohohoho
You, give it back to me
I'm takin' back my love

Give me back all my love (My love, my love)
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love (My love)
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart (Oh, oh, oh, my love)
Give me back all my love (My love)
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love (My love, my love)
I've had a change of heart
Give me back me, give me back me....

Change of heart
Change of heart

Change of heart
Change of heart

I'm takin' back my love
Give me back

Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love
I've had a change of heart

Give me back all my love (My love, my love)
I've had a change of heart
Give me back all my love (My love)
I've had a change of heart
