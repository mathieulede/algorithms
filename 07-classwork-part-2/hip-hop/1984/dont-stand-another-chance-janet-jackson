Standing at the edge of time
'Bout to lose my mind
Cause you try to take him away from me
I won't let it be
You just walk into my life
And try to take away my only prize

But you better give credit
Cause his love is right here for me
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance

He belongs to me
Just wait and see
Take him in my arms
Give him love
Not too much of me
Nothing you can do or say
To make him look your way

So you better give credit
Cause it's gonna come walking my way
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
(Oh)

You don't stand another chance
(You don't stand, baby)
You don't stand another chance
(You don't stand)
You don't stand another chance

Sit and wait at home
'Bout to leave me alone
(I know, baby)
You'll be with him when he's up
Not down
To keep him on the ground

Let me tell you something
It's true
He's not in love with you
So you better give credit
Cause it's nothing coming down your way

You don't stand another chance
(Not a chance, baby)
You don't stand another chance
(You don't stand, baby)

You don't stand another chance
(Baby)
You don't stand another chance
(You don't stand)

Well, you know somebody's gotta lose
We all can't win
Maybe next time, okay?
You guys are confusing

You don't stand another chance
(You don't stand)
You don't stand another chance
(You don't stand, baby)

You don't stand another chance
(You don't stand, baby)
You don't stand another chance
(Another chance)
