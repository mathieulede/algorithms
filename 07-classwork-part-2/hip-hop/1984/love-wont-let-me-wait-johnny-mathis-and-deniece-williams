The time is right, you hold me tight
And love's got me high
Please tell me yes and don't say no
Honey, not tonight

I need to have you next to me
In more ways than one
And I refuse to leave
'Til I see the morning sun
Creep through your window pane
Because love won't let me wait

The time is right to turn down the lights
And take my hand
We'll take a flight and spend the night
In Wonderland

Now move a little close to me
You owe it to yourself
And I will selfishly take a little for myself
And it's because of you
That love won't let me wait

I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
We'll explode in ecstasy
And I won't take the blame
'Coz love won't let me wait

I need your love so desperately
And only you can set me free
When I make love to you
(Love to you)
We'll explode in ecstasy
And I won't take the blame
(And I won't let you take the blame)
'Coz love won't let me wait

Come spend this night in Wonderland
(I want to spend it in Wonderland)
Love won't let me wait
I need to have you next to me
(I want you close to me)
'Coz love won't let me wait

Come spend this night in Wonderland
(I want to spend it in Wonderland)
'Coz love won't let me wait
