Walking sadly through the park
I hear crying in the darkness

And thought I act like I cannot hear

Their situation is very clear:
A girl who's trying to tell her guy

The time has come that they say: "Good-bye"

And his answer tears my heart apart:
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay

Girl
I'll just forget you
You'll see I'm right
You won't get to go away

Love ain't gonna let you
Walking with you through the park

Now it's my voice in the darkness
Just like the girl trying to tell her guy

I'm telling you
We must say "Good-bye"
I can't believe when I hear once more
The very words that were said before -
Come from deep within your broken heart:

Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
.. 
I'll give you one night
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
.. 
I'll get you one more night
Give me tonight
Give me tonight
Give me tonight

Give me tonight
Give me tonight
Give me tonight
.. 
His voice echoes in the darkness
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
.. 
Yes
I'll give you one more night
Give me tonight
Then if you don't wanna stay
