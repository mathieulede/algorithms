One Way Love
Waiting in the shadows
For your love to shine
All my senses reaching
For some sign of light
Waiting for the answers
That will free my heart and mind

You have kept me drifting
Somewhere far from shore
Clinging to a lifeline
That I can't find anymore
Have I ever told you
"This is not what love is for?"

Am I strong enough to walk away?
Am I brave enough to let it change?
Am I wise enough to mean what I say?
Cause a one way love is no love at all
No, a one way love is no love at all

I can feel the distance
Forming with your words
I feel your resistance
To the things that you have heard
But I know what you're losing
And the lessons we have learned

Am I strong enough to walk away?
Am I brave enough to let it change?
Am I wise enough to mean what I say?
Cause a one way love is no love at all
No, a one way love is no love at all

BRIDGE:
So much we will never know
I'm missing you before I go

Am I strong enough to walk away?
Am I brave enough to let it change?
Am I wise enough to mean what I say?
Cause a one way love is no love at all
No, a one way love is no love at all

Am I strong enough to walk away?
Am I brave enough to let it change?
Am I wise enough to mean what I say?
Cause a one way love is no love at all
No, a one way love is no love at all
