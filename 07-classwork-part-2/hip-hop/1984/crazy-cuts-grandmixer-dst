[Cuts by Grand Mixer DXT]

[Intro]
Late one night in the Boogie Down Bronx
The Grand Mixer was working hard
Trying to invent a new form of scratching
So that the elevation of hip-hop could continue
Unaware of the fact that not only was he inventing a new scratch form
But was altering the structure of basic DJ
To him, he found it a success
But his colleagues found him disturbed
And immediately had him committed
They say he was mad, he was insane
And his cuts were..crazy

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
I got those crazy cuts on my mind, all the time
I got those crazy cuts on my mind
And I know you're gonna like it

[Instrumental]
