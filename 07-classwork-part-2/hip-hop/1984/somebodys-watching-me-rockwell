[Verse 1: Rockwell]
I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone in?

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

[Verse 2: Rockwell]
When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on tv see me or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why...

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

(Instrumental)

[Verse 3: Rockwell]
I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
Well is the mailman watching me?
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now (booo! ) - the IRS?

[Hook : Michael Jackson]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

[Hook : Michael Jackson]
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
