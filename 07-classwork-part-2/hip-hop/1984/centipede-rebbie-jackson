[Verse 1:]
Your love is like a raging fire
You're a snake that's on the loose
The strike is your desire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire

[Verse 2:]
I feel a longing for your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To give him all your love
Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Like a centipede you've got
A lot of loving to touch

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know
In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawling
And the moon starts to glow
Then disappears
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawling
He'll be crying in the night
So many tears

[Chorus:]
Crawling like a centipede
Centipede

[Verse 3:]
You came to strike him with your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To bite him with your love
Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Like a centipede you've got
A lot of loving to touch

[Pre-Chorus]
