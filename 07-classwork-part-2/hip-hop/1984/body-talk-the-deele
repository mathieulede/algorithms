Pimp dolls, jam
Jigglettes, slam
Pimp dolls, jam
Jigglettes, slam
Turn it

Just because I shake and party
And roll my sexy body
Don't mean that I'm tryin' to tease

It's called body talk, it's not like the walk
'Cause this time
You're wearin' blue jeans

You rub your left leg slow
And let your body go
And do a little sexy scream
(Oh)

Jam, let's party out
Make your body sweat and shout
A visual sex machine

You're talkin', body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
(Talk body to me)
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk, oh

Jigglettes gonna slam
Yeah, pimp dolls jam
Let your body talk to me

You're lookin' real fine
You're workin' overtime
You're footloose and fancy free

Now it's all about the feel
'Cause now you know the deal
So pump your body 'cross the floor

And put it in the groove
Gonna make it real smooth
And then you're gonna want some more

You're talkin', body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
(Talk body to me)
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk, oh

Say baby, what's that you're doin'?
Well, it looks like your body is talkin' to me
I'm hearin' something, what's that?
Go on, get it, girl
(Ooh)

Sexy body, sure looks good to me
(Body talk with me)
Your sexy body
(Oh, baby)
Sure looks good to me
(Body talk, slam)

Come on and shake your body
I want to hear your body
(Your body)
So come on and shake your body
(Your body)
I want to hear your body

Hey, you got to baby, baby, you got to baby, your body
Hey, you got to baby, baby, you got to baby, your body
Hey, you got to baby, baby, you got to baby, your body
Hey, you got to baby, baby, you got to baby, your body

Your sexy body, sure looks good to me
(Body talk with me)
Your sexy body
(Oh, baby)
Sure looks good to me

Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
(Talk body to me)
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk, oh

Mmm, there she is again
I wonder what she's tryin' to say to me
B O D Y T A L K, talk baby
(Ooh)

Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk
(Talk body to me)
Body talk
Talk body to me, body talk

I like the way you walk, baby
(Body talk, talk body to me)
I wanna hear your body talk, baby
(Body talk)
(Talk body to me)

You know it's really not your fault, baby
(Body talk, talk body to me)
Oh, baby
(Body talk)
Oh

I like the way you walk, baby
(Body talk, talk body to me)
I wanna hear your body talk, baby
(Body talk)
(Talk body to me)

You know it's really not your fault, baby
(Body talk, talk body to me)
Oh, baby

Body talk, talk body to me
Body talk, talk body to me
