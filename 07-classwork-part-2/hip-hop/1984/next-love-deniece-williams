You just the next love in line
Causing a commotion this time
You just the next love in line
Causing a commotion, this time

I hear you're his new lover
You two deserve one another
Breakin' hearts must be your new past time

Right now
Everything seems cozy
Is he sending you candy and roses?
See how he's feeling a month from now

You just the next love, in line
Causing a commotion, this time
You just the next love in line
Causing a commotion, this time

He'll love you then he'll leave you
Mark my words
He's only going to leave you
He's had enough once he's got in your heart

He'll tell you it's forever
Say the right things to make you think he's clever
That's too bad
I thought you were much too smart
Far too smart

You just the next love, in line
Causing a commotion, this time
You just the next love in line
Causing a commotion, this time

He'll make you
He'll make you
He'll make you fall in love

He'll break your
He'll break your
He'll break your break your heart

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la...

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la...

You just the next love in line
Causing a commotion this time
You just the next love in line
Causing a commotion this time

He'll break your
He'll break your
He'll break your break your heart

He'll break your
He'll break your
He'll break your break your heart
