Heart Don't Lie
Heart Don't Lie
*Nobody try things hide (?)
*From what you feel inside
Five long month's we've been going steady
I know it seems like a long time
When I ask the question you say you're not ready
I'm sure it's time for this right now
Don't try to hide it
With words that just aren't true
It's showing in your eyes
I see it, so do you
**('cuz your) Heart don't lie
**You can tell me any old thing
**Heart don't lie
**It won't let you be deceiving
**You know your heart don't lie
I don't want your life, just want to share it
Want the same thing, though I just don't know
So throw away your mask and set your heart freee
Love's a masquerede, girl, can't you see
Why try to hide it with words that just aren't true?
You know you want me 'Cause I feel it and so do you
Brother, you're looking nice
Love me, and your heart don't lie
