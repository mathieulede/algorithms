[Male]:
Someone to count on in a world ever changing
Here I am, stop where you standing
What you need is a lover, a man to take over
Oh, girl, don't look any further
[Both]:
Strange when you think of the chances
That we've both been in a state of mind
Too cool to be careless. Looking for the right thing
Oh baby don't look any further

[Female]:
Tonight (tonight) we're gonna taste a little paradise
[Male]:
Rocking all night long. Rocking all night long
[Both]:
Daylight (daylight) I'll still be looking in your heavenly eyes
[Female]:
Oh we rocked on and on and on

Chorus:
[Both]:
Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o yeah
Don't look any further. Don't you look no further
Day o umba day o na jam bay um bay o yaeh
Don't look any further

[Male]:

To love you all over (love you all over)
[Both]:
Oh baby don't look any further (further)
Don't look any further

[Female]:
Tonight (tonight) we're gonna taste a little paradise
[Male]:
Rock you all night long

Day o umba day o mambu ji ay o
