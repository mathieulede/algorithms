[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Live life like if I want, I do
If I want love, I get it, get it, I get it
Fooled me twice, if I fall for you
If I go there, forget it

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
So you better stay up, player
Yeah, you better keep up, player
Cause tonight is a game-changer
So you better stay up, player

You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back
But it ain't enough
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back
Cause it ain't enough

You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Playing with fire, if I burn, you do
If I hurt, you won't let it (you won't let it)
Stacked my deck like I ain't gon' lose
Like a victim, forget it

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe]
So you better stay up, player
Yeah, you better keep up, player
Cause tonight is a game-changer
So you better stay up, player

[Chorus: Tinashe]
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back
But it ain't enough
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back
Cause it ain't enough

You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love
You and I make so much love

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
All right, baby girl, I don't want them other bitches
You be talking that shit, calling me a player, yeah
Ain't no competition, fuck the opposition
I'm the man of my city, just like the mayor
I met her in the hotel lobby
Then we started loving in the elevator
You know I had to eat that
Tongue on her body, see you later, alligator
Rolling 'round in the bed, smacking her on her ass
She a stone-cold killer, 45 in the back
Mama told her never mess with a nigga like me
I took her to Fruit Town to meet my OG
I took her to the west side, like "What's up?"
We was on the east side, we fucked
Now we sitting court-side, P-dub
Put me in the bed, you ain't gotta worry 'bout it

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe & Chris Brown]
So you better stay up, player
Yeah, you better keep up, player
Cause tonight is a game-changer
So you better stay up, player

[Chorus: Tinashe & Chris Brown]
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back
But it ain't enough
You and I make so much love
Why you got me all fucked up?
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back
Cause it ain't enough

[Chorus: Tinashe & Chris Brown]
You and I make so much love (I been wanna give up, nah)
Player (But you're making it rough, nah)
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back (You got me holdin' back, holdin' back)
You and I make so much love (I been wanna give up, nah)
Player (But you're making it rough, nah)
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back
Cause it ain't enough

[Outro: Tinashe]
(Ain't enough) Player
(Ain't enough)
