DJ keep playing and playing and playing
Get your music on
And on and on and on
DJ keep playing and playing my song
Get your music on
And on and on

Turntable mixer
You're my favorite DJ in the world, oh, oh
When I'm on the dancefloor
Your music makes me a freakin' girl, oh, oh

The way you make me feel
I can't deny your beats are so fly
I'll meet you in the DJ booth
So I can feel it more
Keep on playing

You be checkin me
While my body's moving on the floor, oh, oh
We're keeping eye contact
Baby, you know I'll be back for more, oh, oh

Check one, check two
You know what to do
You got my body so hot
Making love to my mind
As you watch me shake it
(Shake that ass girl, I'll make it nice and wet)

Hey, yo, it's MI flava radio
And the clock on the wall says

You never know when somebody short
Might have to be nice to you
