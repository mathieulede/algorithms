Welcome to Fantasy Island

Music and sexin' go together like a hand in glove
Making love on the dance floor with my clothes on
I need to feel the rhythm of a body here next to mine
So baby can we break it down
If you think that you can take me down

1 - Do you wanna come party
Do you wanna get up
Just a move your body
Til you can't get enough

Do you wanna come party
Do you wanna get up
Just a move your body
Til you can't get enough

2 - You're a freak and you know it
You want it, you show it
You need it, you're feenin
Everyday and every night
You're a freak and you know it
You want it, you show it
And you need to call Adina tonight

Don't think I'm tripping
I just wanna have fun
I got my Vodka and my Henn
I'm bout to find me one
Scoping while I'm toking feeling good tonight
Good and fired up 'cause I'm doing way too much

Repeat 1
Repeat 2 (2x)

What you gonna do
Do you wanna go down
What you gonna do
Do you wanna go down
What you gonna do
Do you wanna go down
What you gonna do
Do wanna go down

Repeat 1
Repeat 2 (2x)

Ad lib
