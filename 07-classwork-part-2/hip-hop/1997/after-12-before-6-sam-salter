It's the remix
Sam Salter

[Repeat 5x]
Get your back up off the wall
Dance, c'mon

[Repeat 2x]
How you gon' leave if you didn't give Sam a dance?
Get your back up off the wall

[Repeat 2x]
You wanna get up?
Well then you gotta get down

I heard the phone ring it's you
Tellin' me all I do is neglect you
The first thing that I don't wanna say
"You know I've been workin' hard all damn day baby"
I don't give a damn what your friends say
Cus you know they all want me anyway
You know that I'll be true to you
My love can't start until you get down

[Hook x2]
Get down on it, after 12 baby
Get down on it, before 6 lady
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, get down on it

And now that 12 o'clock is here
I wanna please you and I'm being sincere
The rest of the night is yours and mine
We're gonna chill, relax and unwind baby

I go to work tired each and every day
Cuase I spent the night before pleasin' my babe
You know that I am true to you
But love can't start until you get down

[Hook]x1
(Shekspeare)
Me and my man, we make you all dance
How you gon' leave without my man Sam?
We can rock a party 'til the early light
If you come after 12 then it's on tonight
He gets props from coast to coast
And if you gotta shorty, he'll love you both
My man Sam brings flav through the air
Remix style for real, Jon and Shekspeare

(Tricky)
Ya ni**a's try to front, like the red ain't crunk
But you keep it in the trunk cause you know it bumps
Then you take it to the crib where your girl lives
Then you set the mood right and you handle your biz
All night, every night, all the cuts you like
When the crew, they bite but it ain't as tight
If you wanna be a baller, shot caller
Then I guess you wanna be Sam Salter

[Hook]x1
[Repeat 4x]
Get your back up off the wall
Dance, c'mon
