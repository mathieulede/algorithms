Ohhh
Yes you are
Tell me the truth

Tell me the truth now baby
Have you found another lover
Someone who cares
And holds you tight
I won't cry
I won't shed a tear
But when your well runs dry
You're gonna miss my loving baby
The way i hold and touch and kiss

The way i do you like this
And do you like that
The way i do you like this
And do you like that
The way i do you like this
And do you like that
The way i do you like this
And do you like that

Now one day
You'll see, it'll be reality
And all pain will come
You'll search for me
High and low
But all remains
Is a memory
Of how i used to hold and touch and squeeze you baby I

The way i do you like this
And do you like that
The way i do you like this
And do you like that
The way i do you like this
And do you like that
The way i do you like this
And do you like that

The way i do you like this
And do you like that
The way i do you like this
And do you like that
The way i do you like this
And do you like that
The way i do you like this
And do you like that
