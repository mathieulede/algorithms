[Chorus:]
I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go
But I really need to know
Can we get it together?
Get it together
(Get it together)

I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
(I don't wanna stay)
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
Get it together

[Verse 1:]
You don't know
The pain that I feel
You've taken my love for granted
And you just wanna see it your way
Hey

It's about that time
I'm gonna tell you
What's on my mind
(What's on my mind)

I'm fed up with you
Not being here with me
When you know love is all I need

[Chorus:]
I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go
But I really need to know
Can we get it together?
(Can we get it? yeah)
Get it together

(And I don't wanna)
I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
(Don't want to stay)
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
Get it together
(Let's get together, babe)

[Verse 2:]
I cannot go
Cause being confused just takes control
I hope we can start brand new
'Cause I don't want to lose you
Oh, no

With a love we share
Baby
It's oh so rare
I'm willing to try
And make you see
That all you need is here in me

[Chorus:]
I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna go
Let me know how you feel
(Let me know how you feel)

(I don't wanna)
I don't wanna stay
(Don't wanna go, oh, no)
I don't wanna go
But you gotta let me know
(You gotta let me know)
Just how you feel
(Just how you feel, yeah)

(I don't wanna stay, no, no)
I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go
(And I don't want to go)
But I really need to know
Can we get it together?
Get it together
(Come on, babe)
(Let's get it together)

I don't really wanna go
I don't really wanna stay
But I really hope and pray
Can we get it together?
(Come on, boy)
Get it together
(Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge:]
See, I'm so confused
I just don't know what to do
And I don't understand, no

You know
I don't wanna stay
You know
I don't wanna go
Baby, please
Listen to me

[Chorus:]
(I don't wanna)
I don't really wanna stay
I don't really wanna go
(Don't wanna go)
But I really need to know
Can we get it together?
(Can we? Yeah)
Get it together
(I hope, I pray, baby, baby)
