Um, mmm, is it something that I'm missin'?
Um, mmm, is it something that you got?
Um, mmm, not to go to a sleep about a dream, yeah, baby

What's stopping you from loving me?
When I can give you all you need
What's stopping you from loving me?
You must be sleepin', still out there creepin'

Everything you do, oh, you know I like
Girl, it ain't cool saying okay and then stay inside
Girl, I'll be patient, I'll even change my ways
Looking for your love is like walking through a stage

What's stopping you from loving me?
When I can give you all you need
What's stopping you from loving me?
You must be sleepin', still out there creepin'

Is it the way I talk, oh, that you don't like
Baby, I'll change and I'll try to make it right
How could you give somebody else the time of day
When he won't show you love, not in my special way

What's stopping you from loving me?
When I can give you all you need
What's stopping you from loving me?
You must be sleepin', still out there creepin'

I'm just telling you what I think is best
Girl, I won't trouble you, no, not like the rest
Don't you tell me yes and then tell me no
Girl, I can take the hint if I gotta go

What's stopping you from loving me?
When I can give you all you need
What's stopping you from loving me?
You must be sleepin', still out there creepin'

What's stopping you from loving me?
When I can give you all you need
What's stopping you from loving me?
You must be sleepin', still out there creepin'

(Oh I, oh I, oh I)
I could be that you want, babe
(Oh I, oh I, oh I)
Come on, baby, let's talk, baby

(Oh I, oh I, oh I)
Don't you want to give it up, girl yeah
(Oh I, oh I, oh I)
How I want it, how I need it

What's stopping you from loving me?
When I can give you all you need
What's stopping you from loving me?

What's stopping you from loving me?
When I can give you all you need
What's stopping you from loving me?
