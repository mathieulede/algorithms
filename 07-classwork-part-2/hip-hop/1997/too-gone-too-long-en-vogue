Did I hear you say that
You want another chance
You need another try
You're ready to reclaim your prize

So, you want my love back
Why'd you let it slip away
Why'd you ever let me go
Your change of heart has come too late

Well, the door is locked
You can't get in
The game has changed
You've been

1 - Too gone, too long, baby
To ever get back again
In my heart

Too gone, too long, baby
You're too many tears too late
To ever come back, to get back in my arms

Been gone
Too gone, too long

Didn't you hear me say that
You'd be a fool to leave
You'd regret the road you chose
You'd come running right back to me

You had such a good love, sugar
You'll never find with no one else
But what I knew all the time
You had to find out for yourself

And now you'll never know
That love again
You're on your own
You've been

Repeat 1

Been gone
Too gone, too long

Did you really think I'd take you back
Let you back in my life
Oh, baby
Just like that
Someone new is loving me
Loving you is what used to be
Baby, you're too late
To win my heart again

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

No, never
No, never
Just too long
I don't need you
I don't want you
Later for you baby
Oh, oh
Hit the road, Jack
And don't you come back
No more
No more
