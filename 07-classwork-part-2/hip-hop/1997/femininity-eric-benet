Oooh, what you do to me (yeah, yeah)

Quietly, your silhouette approaches me
A vision far too lovely to define (hey, yeah)
Tenderly, you take complete control of me
The feminine seduction of body, soul and mind (yeah)

CHORUS:

Touch me, and I feel your femininity
Girl, you're the lady women want to be
Softly, you move when you're making love to me
Love me every night with femininity

A child of innocence is how you look at me
But it's the woman's touch that makes it feel so right (so right)
Your lips consume my deepest sensitivity
It feels so good, it makes me wanna cry (make me cry)

CHORUS:

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Femininity (ow!)
Oh, femininity

Let me feel myself inside you once again
I love the way you say it's just for me
A lady in the purest sense of elegance
But when the lights go down, girl, you're making love
Strong, wild and free

CHORUS

I like the way you take control of me
Lady, you have a little certain quality
Not many girls would ever dare to be
The lady that you are
Femininity
