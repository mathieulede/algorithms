I want the party jumping to my scene
I gotta make it move you if you know what I mean
Let's get it started, gotta stack the cream
I'm making power moves, trying to stay on the scene
But it doesn't matter who you are
Everybody wants to be a star
Rise, Rise
So get ready 'cuz here I come
To represent where I'm from
Rise, Rise
(Listen to me, let me tell you)
I came to get the job done
Hold on tight 'cause here I come to
Rise, Rise
All ride with the top down
Straight hip-pop to underground we
Rise, Rise
And some might wonder of my capabilities
But they won't hold me back
Never throw me off track
'Cuz you know it's like that
Make no mistake, won't hesitate
No, that's not my style, keep on rising all the while
East to west and southern belt
Everybody like to party all night
Won't stop till we get it right
Rise, Rise
It's a showdown, can't slow down
The time is now for me to shine
Rise, Rise
I came to get the job done
Hold on tight 'cause here I come to
Rise, Rise
All ride with the top down
Straight hip-pop to underground we
Rise, Rise
Yeah, yo
You can't stop my shine
Don't matter what rocks your buying
I got the kind that blind
Even when it's dark 'cuz I park the ride
Spark lice with the fellas
Half are jealous, 'cuz of the cash in the ellis
Four-hundred, y'all want it but you can't get it
Betta forget it, and settle for a damn rent-it
Any women in their right mind, gonna like mine
He just rhyme, I got the pipeline
So, I like 'em read to the bone
Girl, I'll make you moan when your daddy getting home
Hit you in the zone, now who the king of the thrown
That be bringing their dog when you feenin' to bone
Honeys be singing my song, hummin' the ad lids
Some of the baddest mommies want me to run in their marriage
Joey crack is the true playa
The new mayor of rap
Back with that ol' school flava, what?
What? What? What? What? Uh,yeah
I gotta break it down one time
One time is here to blow your mind
C'mon and let me do my thing
Gone tear this party out the spring
I gotta break it down one time
One time is here to blow your mind
C'mon and let me do my thing
Gone tear this party out the frame
