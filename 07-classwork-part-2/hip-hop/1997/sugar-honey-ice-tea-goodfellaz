How can I explain , I never meant to cause you pain?
I'm standin' out in the rain
Maybe you're thinking
Maybe it's a game, but I feel so all alone
I call but you're never home
I feelin' like your heart is gone

Tell me baby, tell me I'm wrong
Tryin' to make you understand
Just wanna be your man

Sugar Honey Ice tea
Honey, honey it gots to be sugar, sugar
Honey ice tea
Oooo baby ****I love sugar, sugar honey ice tea
Honey girl, honey
It's got to be sugar honey ice tea
****I love you, ****I love you
Now baby my next move is
I gotta get next to you
So then maybe I can prove
I'm the best man and you'll never want to lose me

I believe my lesson's learned
I won't leave a stone unturned
This time you won't get burned
Put you before all my concerns
Tryin' to make you understand
Just wanna be your man

Chorus

I don't mean to have to cuss or fuss
When it comes to the two of us
Being without you is just too rough
A thousand other loves wouldn't be enough
I don't wanna be alone tonight
I need you here to make it alright
And every morning I need another taste
Please don't leave my love to waste
