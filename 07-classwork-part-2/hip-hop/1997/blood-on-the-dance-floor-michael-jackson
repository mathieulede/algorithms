[Intro]
She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane

[Verse 1]
Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're going to get it

Every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)

[Pre-Chorus]
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it

[Chorus]
Susie got your number
And Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
And Susie says its right

[Verse 2]
She got your number
How does it feel
To know this stranger
Is out to kill

She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only
Erase the past

Every night stance is like taking a chances
It's not about love and romance
And now you're going to get it

Every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)

[Pre-Chorus]
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
And I just can't take it
Just can't break it

[Chorus]
Susie got your number
And Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
You know Susie says its right

[Chorus]
Susie's got your number
Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under
She put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number
Susie says its right

[Outro]
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(blood on the dance floor)

And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it
O
