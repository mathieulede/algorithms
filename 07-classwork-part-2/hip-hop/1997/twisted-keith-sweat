And think about it my dear

(Chorus 2)
(But I gotta be strong)
But I gotta be strong

I got what you need right here, baby
So what you wanna do

[Keith Sweat]
Breaking up down

[Pretty Russ]
Breaking up down
You got me twisted
Thinking about the way that things use to be
When It was you and me girl I was so free
See, you had my heart from the start
Like Cupid
And I was just down right foolish and stupid
But now I know the reason for the pain and the headaches
You left me all alone now I can't even concentrate
I guess I'll wait for the day until you come back
Because my heart is where your love is at
You got me twisted

(Chorus 1)
(You know you are my lover)
You know you are my love, baby
(You got me twisted over you)
Girl, you got me twisted over you
(I know I got what you need)
I got what you need right here, baby
So what you wanna do

(You know you are my lover)
You know you are my love, baby
(You got me twisted over you)
Girl, you got me twisted over you
(I know I got what you need)
I got what you need right here, baby
So what you wanna do

(You know you are my lover)
You know, you know you are my love, baby
(You got me twisted over you)
Girl, you got me twisted over you
(I know I got what you need)
I got what you need right here, baby
So what you wanna do
