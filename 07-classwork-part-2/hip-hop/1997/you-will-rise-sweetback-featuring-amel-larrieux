I got a story that must be heard
About a little girl who wished she was a bird
She was unhappy livin' in her ghetto cage
But it gave her hope when her sweet grandma would say:

(Baby, you will rise)
Rise
(Limit is the skies)
The skies
(Don't let nobody fill your head with their lies)
Nobody. fill your head with lies
(Baby, you will rise)
Rise
(Never compromise)
Compromise
(Milk and honey is waitin' for you on the other side)
Waitin' for you on the other side

Yeah

She had a burning desire to go far
And she had lively hopes of reaching every star
One day she'd leave this place
But never forget her people's face
And when she found her dreams
She'd come back and proclaim:

(Baby, you will rise)
Rise
(Limit is the skies)
The skies
(Don't let nobody fill your head with their lies)
Nobody. fill your head with lies
(Baby, you will rise)
Rise
(Never compromise)
Compromise
(Milk and honey is waitin' for you on the other side)
Waitin' for you on the other side

You will rise

(Baby, you will rise)
Rise
(Limit is the skies)
The skies
(Don't let nobody fill your head with their lies)
Nobody. fill your head with lies
(Baby, you will rise)
Rise
(Never compromise)
Compromise
(Milk and honey is waitin' for you on the other side)
Waitin' for you on the other side

Got a burning in my heart
To keep it real and do my part
Got a burning in my soul
To recognize where I'm from, yeah
Got a burning in my heart
To keep it real and do my part
Got a burning in my soul
To recognize where I'm from, yeah
