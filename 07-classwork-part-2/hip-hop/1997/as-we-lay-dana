It's morning
And we've slept the night away
It happened
Now we can't turn back the hands of time
Yes we've stolen this moment
We've forgot about one simple fact
We both belong to someone else
As we slept the night away
Chorus
As we lay
We forgot about tomorrow as we lay
As we lay
Didn't think about the price we had to pay
It's morning
And now it's time for us to say good-bye (good-bye)
(Good-bye, baby) you're leaving me
I know you gotta hurry home and face your wife
I would never never wanna hurt her (never, baby)
She would never ever ever understand
You belong to me for just one night
As we slept the night away
Chorus
We should of captured all of our thoughts
But instead we got lost
In the second
In the minute
In the hour (in the hour, baby)
