[Verse 1]
Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away from each other

[Chorus 1]
Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay
And after all that you've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise you, baby
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

[Verse 2]
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Not for a day, from your body
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away from the one that I love

[Chorus 2]
Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now, I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go
After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise you
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go
I can't let go
