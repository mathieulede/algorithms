I was sittin' at home
Thinkin' to myself
I started thinkin' 'bout you
How much I do love you
I really do

I would never trade you
Never forsake you
Cuz nothin' could be better
That's why I wrote you this letter
I love you always lady

CHORUS

Last night
I wrote a short letter
And it went this way
Dear baby I love you just thinkin' of you
Love always

CHORUS

Now I know I could've called
But it seem much better this way
Cuz I'm missin' my baby
I'm so blessed your my lady, lady
Now I know I can't wait until tomorrow
When you're in my arms again
Holdin' and kissin' you
Doin' the things we love to do
Until then

CHORUS

CHORUS

I love you, I love you, I love you
And there is nothin' that I wouldn't do
Just to prove that I really, really love you
And baby I want you, I want you, I want you
And there is nothing that I'd rather do
Than to love you
I love you always
Every night and every day
I love you, I love you, I love you

CHORUS

Ad lib until fade
