Jiggah, uh huh Changes faces
Yo, all of my rhymes fall
All of my days I trade
All of my diamonds
And all my bad ways are fade
Kill the daylight cruisin'
All you see is the break lights
And hair blowing
You know where we going
Or at the club in the rear frontin'
Popin' droppin' need bounce some cats
But we ain't triyin' to hear nothing
Probably was wildin'
Are you the Whitney to gimme
Holding me down and slow me down and be twisy
Keep the ice out the club like
Change faces
Get a lil

Wait, make me think about you
Even when you are not around
