[Intro:]
Tumbling Dice
Trackmasters in the mix

We just came to get on down
Get on down
We just want to have some
Have some fun

We just came to get on down
Get on down
We just came to have some
Have some fun, fun

[Verse 1:]
I know you've been
Through some real hard times
But don't let this world
Take the best from you

Just take a minute
To relax your mind
Love's got the power over all
That you've been through

[Chorus:]
I've been up & I've been down
I've been here and there
I've been around

I've been searching for someone
Who can take me
Make me high
Wanna feel real love
Paradise

[Verse 2:]
I need you to be there for me
It's just the way I feel
You know I'm always real

Don't fight this feeling
That you feel inside
Love's taken over and there
Ain't nowhere to hide

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Repeat x2:]
This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, hey

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

I've been up
And I've
I've been up
And down

[Repeat x4:]
Rock on, rock on
Rock on, rock on

[Repeat x4:]
We just came to get on down
Get on down
We just want to have some
Have some fun
