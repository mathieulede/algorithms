Mase and Brian McKnight
Bad Boy
C'mon

Bad Boy
We don't stop
We rock, we rock
Yo

I hit you with the sound that the world can't take
Came straight out the gate playing 2.8
Real studded jewel funded
Got to love it

First rap cat with the R&B budget
Every day on the TV me and PD
Girl's so pretty, make their man break the CD
Why y'all forever roudy
I be out here somewhere in Maui
Till I go back to Cali

Can't understand
How he can treat you the way that he does
Give me the chance to show you, baby
You're better off with me

(Ooh, so will you let me try
I wanna make you smile)
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
(I won't ever let you down
I'll always be around)

And you should be mine
(He don't love you right
Don't waste your time
Don't waste your time)

If he don't treat you like he should
(No, baby)
Than you should be mine
You should be mine, baby

Why can't you see you should be happy
And I don't know why
You don't believe a man can love you for the rest of your life

(So baby let me try
I wanna make you smile)
I wanna love you like you need to be loved
(I'll never let you down
I'll always be around)
And you should be mine

If he don't love you right (Ooh)
Don't waste your time
Don't waste your time
If he don't treat you like he should (now)
Then you should be mine
You should be mine (Ooh ooh)

Yo!
What the deal, honey?
Insecure feel funny
I know you're used to dealin' with cats with real money
Plus I know you're like Mase in alot of ways
But it's hard to go on when you're lonely in the holidays

When you shopping
Did you shop for 2?
Uh!
Take you where the waters aqua blue
Let you fall back
Treat you like you're all that
Under umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat

You ain't the one out clubbing all day and all night
Just to save a fight
Or say he's right
And I know he ain't the cat that will stay in you life
Even though he gave you ice gown that will make you his wife

How a man deserve you if he hurt you?
Then he give a woman 25 a curfew
Between me and you
You ain't heard that from me
Cuz Mase ain't the player with the PhD

Girl, come into my world
I love you the way that you need to be loved
No worries, no more
Girl, open the door

And don't waste your time
Cuz you should be mine
If he don't love you right
(Ooh, baby)
Don't waste your time
(Don't waste your time)
If he don't treat you like he should (ooh)

You should be mine
(Should be mine, baby baby)
If he don't love you right
Don't waste your time
(Don't waste your time)
