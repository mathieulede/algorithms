Somebody told him
I haven't been true
He's gonna find somebody new

(CHORUS)
Little bell in the chapel, ring
Little bell in the chapel, ring
Little bell, won't you tell him
He's the only one I love

I saw him the other day
And he told me goodbye
Said he heard I'd been
Going out with some other guy

Love him all my heart
And I want him to know
That I can't live without him
Won't you tell him so

Oh, oh, oh

(CHORUS)
Oh, I tried to call him up
Cause I know he's alone
But he lets it keep ringing
Won't pick up the phone

I know that I could explain
I know he'd understand
If I only could kiss him
And hold his hand

Somebody told him
I haven't been true
He's gonna find somebody new

Little bell in the chapel, ring
(Little bell)
Little bell in the chapel, ring
(Little bell)
Little bell, won't you tell him
He's the only one
(Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Little bell, won't you tell him
He's the only one
(Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Little bell, won't you tell him
He's the only one
(Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Little bell, won't you tell him
He's the only one
(Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)...
