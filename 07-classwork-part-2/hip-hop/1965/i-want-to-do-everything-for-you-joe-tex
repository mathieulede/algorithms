I want to hold you in my arms
Till you say turn you lose
I want to do the things for you
Till you say it ain't no use
I want to wake you every morning
With a good morning kiss
I want to kiss you to sleep the same way
'Cause I know you like this
I want to do everything for you
'Cause that's all that man can do
When he loves a woman like I love you
And I love ya, love ya
I love ya, love ya, love ya
I love ya, love ya, love ya
Ooh, ee, yes I love you

I want to say sweet things to you
Till you say I said enough
I want to stand right by your side
When the goin' gets tough
I want to mend your broken heart
Till you say the hurt is gone
I want to stay with you always
So that you won't be alone
I want to do everything for you
'Cause that's all that man can do
When he loves a woman like I love you
And I love ya, love ya, love ya
Love ya, love ya, love ya
Ooo, eee, like I love you

I want to work for you every day
Till you say come home and rest
I want to buy you pretty things
So you can look your best
I want to take you everywhere
So the world can see what I got
I want to treat you with tender love
Till you say I've got to stop
I want to do everything for you
'Cause that's all that man can do
When he loves a woman like I love you
And I love ya love ya, love ya, love ya
Yes, I love ya, love ya
Love ya
