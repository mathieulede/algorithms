Put on your wig, woman
We goin' out to shake and fingerpop, hey baby
I said, put on your wig, woman
We goin' out to shake and fingerpop, hey girl
We gonna get out on the floor now
Dance like we never dance befo', right on

I said, look at them people
Tryin' the big, Fly
Doin' The Barracuda
The Jerk and The Twine

Kick off your shoes, baby
And get in the groove
'Cause when you hear the music
Yo' feet has got to move

I said, put on your wig, woman
Goin' out to shake and fingerpop
That's what I'll do
Gonna get out on the floor now
Dance like we never danced befo'
Dance, dance

I said, do The Boomerang
The Twine and The Jerk
They're jammin' at the bandstand
So ev'rybody work

I said, put on your wig, woman
We goin' out to shake and fingerpop
Stay is what I'll do
Gonna get out on the floor, now
Dance like we never danced befo'
Hey, shake
