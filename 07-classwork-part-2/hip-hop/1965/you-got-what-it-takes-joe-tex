Some boys say they like your eyes
I heard some boys say
They love the way they hypnotize

Oh honey, I don't know
What it is you got
All I know is that you got what it takes
Um, to take what I got

Oh, now some boys say
They love your walk
I heard some boys say
Just the other day
They love your sweet baby talk

Oh, I don't know
I can't see what it is you got
All I know is that you got what it takes
Ooh, to take what I got
Hah, hah, yeah

Some boys say they love your smile
I heard some boys say
They love the way you just drive 'em wild

Oh, I don't know
I'm tryin' to figure out what it is you got
All I know is that you got what it takes
Ah, to take what I got

Hah, hah, you can get anything I got
Flashin' your pretty eyes
You got what it takes
