I don't wanna be happy
With somebody else
When I know in my mind I'd be wastin' her time
No need of fooling myself

And if you don't love me
I'd be concerned about the life I lead (life I lead)
Why to me introduce someone else
When you know someone else I don't need

I need you
I need, you!
I need you
Well I guess I'm just a stubborn fool
Kind of hard headed like a mule
But how, do I love someone else
When I need you
When I need you!

Well I guess, these things don't matter
And I apologise
There's no kind of love between us
I can see from the looks of your eyes
And now you're with another
And you say that I should join the clan
And I guess I could be happy
That is if I was another man

But I need you
I need, you!
I need you
And I guess I'm just a stubborn fool
Kind of hard headed like a mule
But how do I love someone else

When I need you
When I need you!
When I need you!
When I need you!
When I need you!
