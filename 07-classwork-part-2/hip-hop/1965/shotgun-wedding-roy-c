People were standing, all around
At a shot gun wedding, here in this town
And I'm the victim oh yeh
Of a shotgun wedding
'Cause your fathers got a gun
And there ain't no place to run
Shotgun wedding and oh yeh
Now I got to find a job, yes I have
You, me, the baby makes three
Shotgun (shotgun)
Shotgun (shotgun)
Shotgun (shotgun)
Shotgun (shotgun)
Shotgun (shotgun)
Shotgun (shotgun)
Shotgun wedding and oh yeh
Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife
Oh, yeh, yeh look around
And all I could see
All I could see
Shotgun (shotgun)
Shotgun (shotgun)
Shotgun (shotgun)
Shotgun wedding
Somebody please come rescue me
Shotgun (shotgun)
Shotgun (shotgun)
