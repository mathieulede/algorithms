A man can say what he won't do
But if she really, really wants to
A woman can change a man

She can make him weak
Or make him strong
Make him do right
Or she can make him do wrong

'Cause everything a man does
He does it for a woman
Hmm, mm, hmm

Now I'm not saying that
This is true with all men
'Cause as you know
There are exceptions to all the rules

But if you ask the average man
What is he living and working for from day to day
I bet nine out of ten of those men would say

They would say that I'm living
And working for my little woman
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Man can say that you can't tie him down
But if she really wants him around
A woman can change a man

She can make life bright
Or make it dim
She can give him children
That look exactly like him

Because everything a man does
He does it for a woman
