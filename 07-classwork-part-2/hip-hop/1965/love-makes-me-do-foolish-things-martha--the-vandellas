Love, love, love makes me do foolish things
Sit alone by the phone, a phone that never rings
Hoping to hear you say, you love me still
Knowing you never will

Love, love, love has made a fool of me
Got me doing things, things that shouldn't be
Listening for the sound of your knock on my door
Knowing that sweet sound will be no more

Funny, how precious memories linger on
So long after you're gone
And oh, precious memories that only make me cry
But I keep holding on, oh, why do I?

All because love, love, love makes me do these things
Speak your name softly each night
While holding your picture tight
When you took my heart, you took my soul
And it's far beyond control

Funny how precious memories linger on
So long, after you've gone
Oh, precious memories that only make me cry
But I keep holding on, oh, why do I?

All because love, love, love makes me do these things
Speak your name softly each night
While holding your picture tight
