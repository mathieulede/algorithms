We may not have a cent to pay the rent
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
We may have to eat beans every day
But we're gonna make it, I know we will

And if a job is hard to find
And we have to stand in the welfare line
I've got your love and you know you got mine
So we're gonna make it, I know we will

We may not have a home to call our own
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
We may have to fight hardships alone
But we're gonna make it, I know we will

'Cause togetherness brings peace of mind
We can't stay down all the time
I've got your love and you know you got mine
So we're gonna make it, I know we will

Our car may be old, our two rooms cold
But we're gonna make it, I know we will
We may not can spare a roach a crumb
But we're gonna make it, I know we will

And if I have to carry 'round a sign
Sayin' "Help the deaf, the dumb, and the blind"
I got your love and you know you got mine
So we're gonna make it, I know we will

We're gonna make it
(We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it)
We're gonna make it, baby
(We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it)

It might seem hard sometime
(We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it)
But don't worry, darlin' baby
(We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it)

We're gonna keep on tryin'
(We're gonna make it, we're gonna make it)
