I always thought I could
Fall from a height
Land on my feet
Now I'm considering
Throwing in the towel
Admitting defeat
Just like the Four Tops
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself

Nothing worth finding
Is easily found
Try as we might
That was supposed to sound
Very profound
It probably sounds trite
Just like the Four Tops
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Myself myself myself

Just like the Four Tops
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
I can't help myself

I felt I had to tell the world
About you
I felt I had to tell the world
About you
Yes I felt I had to tell the world
Tell the world
Tell the world
I can't help myself
Tell the world
Tell the world
Tell the world about you, baby
I can't help myself
Tell the world
Tell the world
C'mon c'mon c'mon
C'mon c'mon c'mon
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Tell the world
Tell the world
I can't help myself
