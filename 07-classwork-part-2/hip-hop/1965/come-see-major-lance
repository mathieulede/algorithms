Hey, mama, won't you come and see
What the music has done to me
I just started not so very long
It seems to come out all in song
Come now, now or later
Sing the Mashed Potato
My feet going beserk
As I do the New York Jerk
Come see
Hey, mama, what you doing now
Won't you see that I know how
The beat is blasting on the radio
Come see before the miracle
Come look and get?
As I go back to the old Twist
Gotta do a little dance now
Come see
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, mama, won't you come and see
What the music has done to me
I just started not so very long
It seems to come out all in song
Come now, now or later
Sing the Mashed Potato
My feet going beserk
As I do the New York Jerk
Come see
Yeah, yeah
Come see
