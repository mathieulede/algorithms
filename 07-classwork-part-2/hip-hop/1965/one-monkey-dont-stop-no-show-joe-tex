Oh yes
Oh yes
All right
You know I got a letter from a friend of mine in New York City the other day
He said, Joe, I heard you've had some trouble with the girls down home
Said you ought to catch a bus and come on up to New York
Said they got enough women up here to go around
I'm thinking find yourself something
Because people don't go around stealing loved ones away from them up here in New York
He said in the letter that things don't happen like that up here in New York
Oh yes he did
He said things just don't happen like that up here in New York
He said things just don't happen like that up here in New York
He said things just don't happen like that up here in New York
Oh yes
Oh yes he did
All right

So I'm saying to you who are listenin'
If you've been unlucky in love
And lost somebody
And a voice come to you in the middle of the night and tell you to get up
Listen, you better get on up
If you're having breakfast one morning
And a voice come to you at the table
And say get up
Listen, I want you to get on up
You're out on the job
And a voice come to you on the job
He says get up, listen you better get on up
Yeah baby, get yourself on up, oh yes
You had better get on up, oh yeah
Yup yeah, yeah

You better get on up and walk
Like me and women
And go somewhere and find your somebody
That's what you better do
Cause I'll tell you one thing
There's something that I found out a long time ago
It took me a long time to find it out
But I think I got it now
Oh, took me a long time to find it out
But I think I got it now
Oh yes I did
I found out a long time ago
(One monkey don't stop no show) [repeated in background]
Oh yes I did
I found out that one monkey
Just don't stop no show
Ha ha ha, yes I did
Found out that one monkey
Just don't stop no show
Found out that one monkey just don't stop no show
And if you believe it
You hear you sing one time for me tonight
I said if, if, if you believe it
Let me hear you sing it one time for me tonight
I said if, if, if
