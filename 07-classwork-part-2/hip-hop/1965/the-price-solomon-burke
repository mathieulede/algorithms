After I hung up my
Heart for you, darling
And I said, if you ever need me
All you had to do was call

I stood up and I told the
Whole wide world that
You were good for me, baby

Yes, then you laughed and
You called me your personal clown
In front of all your friends

You walked away and you left me
Standing up like a fool
I couldn't even go to my
Friends or my relations

All I could do was stand up
And hang my head in shame
You see what you cost me

You cost my mother
The love of my father
Sister, my brother too
Oh, yes, you did

You see now what you've caused
And I know just what I lost
And I know what the price
I paid, I paid, I paid
For loving someone like you

Oh, I can hear my friends saying
I told you (told you) I told you
And I can hear my mother say
Fool, I told you

You see what you
Oh, yes, you do
You look back and
You wonder sometimes

And I see the price I payed
I payed for loving someone
Someone, someone, someone like you

Baby, I don't care
What the world might say
I'm gonna love you any old way

And although you let me down, baby
My, my, my, deep down in my heart
I feel for nobody else but you

(Say what you want)
And I don't care what my
Mother and my father might say
(Say what you like)
And I don't care if the
World talk about me, darling

But, oh, sometimes, sometimes
I just sit in my lonely room
And I moan all to myself
Why don't come back home

Now holler to me, baby
My, my, my, my, my baby...
