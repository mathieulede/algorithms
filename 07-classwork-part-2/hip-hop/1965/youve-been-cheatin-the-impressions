I'm tryin hard to forget
That you've been cheatin'
Wishing, you I had never met
'Cause you've been cheatin'

Did you know lies
Can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free

No use in cryin'
You've been lyin'
You've been cheatin', cheatin' on me

Yeah, you make me suspect and I know (wooh wooh)
You don't want me
Cookies crumble and that's how it go (wooh wooh)
You don't want me

Did you know lies
Can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free

No use in cryin'
You've been lyin'
You've been cheatin', cheatin' on me
Yeah-eh

Another lover, you discover
Our loves gone and I don't know why
It's just as well though, at last I do know
All said was just a lie

So I'm tryin' hard to forget (wooh wooh)
You've been cheatin'
Wishing, you I had never met
'Cause you've been cheatin'

Did you know lies
Can be seen in your eyes
And from wrong you'll never be free

No use in cryin'
You've been lyin'
You've been cheatin', cheatin' on me
Whoo baby (you've been cheatin')
You must not love me (you've been cheatin')
You must not love me (you've been cheatin')
You just don't care (you've been cheatin')
