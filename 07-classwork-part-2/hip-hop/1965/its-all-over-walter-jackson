It's all over

How can I tell her it's all over?
How can I say that I'm going away?
I'll break her heart, I'm sure
Yet I'll hurt mine much more
And I've got to explain that it's all over

How can I tell her that I'm in love with you?
What words can I use to say you love me too
Without making her cry and I am no good guy?
Yes, I've got to explain but it's all over now
(It's all over)

Should I start a false fight?
(No, no, that wouldn't do)
Would it, wouldn't be right
(No, no, that wouldn't do)

Should I just run away?
(No, no, that wouldn't do)
I've got to find someone to tell my baby, it's all over now
(It's all over)
It's all over now
(It's all over)

How do I tell her this is the way we feel?
All the happiness we share, [Incomprehensible]
It has been plunged into the ground, oh, so wide I can't get around
I've just got to find someone to tell my baby, it's all over
(It's all over)

Should I start a false fight, my woman?
(No, no, that wouldn't do)
No, it wouldn't be right, my baby
(No, no, that wouldn't do)

Should I just run away?
(No, no, that wouldn't do)
I've just got to find someone to tell my baby, it's all over now
(It's all over)
It's all over
(It's all over)

It's all over now, my woman
We don't want each other no more
It's all over now
(It's all over)
Don't walk out the door before you believe
We've tried everything we could
