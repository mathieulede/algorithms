Nothing can stop me
So bad, do I feel inside
Get my hat, I'm checkin' out
'Cause you and your friends really hurt my pride
So unexspected you shot me down
With all the fella's standing around yeah
'Please don't go', that's what they'll be saying
'Please don't go', But I'm not playing
'Cause nothing can stop me

(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Nothing can stop me
Though you and I where pretty close
I'm calling it quits girl
'Cause it was you I really dug the most
You made me feel like I was two feet tall
While all the others laughed and squalled yeah
'Please don't go', that's what they'll be saying
'Please don't go', But I'm not playing
'Cause nothing can stop me

Don't mind me havin' the blues
You made me loose my cool
Fella's honestly
You treat me so cold and you're so mean

Nothing can stop me
So bad, do I feel inside
Get my hat, I'm checkin' out
'Cause you and your friends really hurt my pride
So unexspected you shot me down
With all the fella's standing around yeah
'Please don't go', that's what they'll be saying
'Please don't go', But I'm not playing
'Cause nothing can stop me

(Yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)
(yeah yeah)
