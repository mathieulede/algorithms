Only those in love
Only those in love

Someone light the moon
In the sky above
Moonbeams pour
But they're for
Only those in love

Jealously, my eyes
Watched her little girl
All day through
Only those in love

My all, I would gladly give
For a chance to live
In the world of love
Someone, someone

Someone send the one
That I'm dreaming of
My heart to be part
Of only those in love
Of only those in love
