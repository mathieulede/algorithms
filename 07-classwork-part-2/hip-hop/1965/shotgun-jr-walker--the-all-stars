I said, Shotgun!
Shoot 'em 'fore they run now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the dirty now
Hey

Put on your red dress
And then you go downtown now
I said, Buy yourself a shotgun now
We're going to break it down baby now
We're going to load it up baby now
Oh can you shoot 'em 'fore they run now

I said, Shotgun!
Shoot 'em 'fore they run now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the dirty now
Hey

Shotgun!
Shoot 'em 'fore they run now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the dirty now
Hey

Put on your high heel shoes
I said we're going down here listen to 'em play the blues
We're gonna dig potatoes
We're gonna pick tomatoes

I said, Shotgun!
Shoot 'em 'fore they run now
Do the jerk, baby
Do the dirty now
Hey

I said it's twine time
I said it's twine time
I said it's twine time
Hey, look at that
