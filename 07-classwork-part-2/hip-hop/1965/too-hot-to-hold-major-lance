Too hot to hold now, baby
Too hot to hold, baby
Love's so wild
It's like a raging fire
And only you could be
My heart desire
You treat me any old way
You see fit, yeah
I wanna quit but
I just can't split
You're worth much more
Than money and dough
And your love is
Too hot to hold
Too hot to hold now, baby
(It's too hot to hold)
Too hot to hold, baby
I tended to be dumb to
All the wrongs you done
You just keep on goofing, baby
You say it's all in fun
All of your little friends
Make me so mad, yeah
Trying to be smart
They think they're bad
But don't get me wrong
Cause I can be bold
And your love is
Too hot to hold
Too hot to hold now, baby
(It's too hot to hold)
Too hot to hold, baby
I know I love you
More each day
And I, I hate to do it
But I've got to get away
Time and time again
I cry please, yeah
(Girl) have mercy and
Give my heart a little ease
I feel you're gonna hurt me
This I've been told
So your love is
Too hot to hold
Too hot to hold now, baby
Too hot to hold, baby
