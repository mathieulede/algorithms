[Verse 1]
Darling, please stay, don't go away
(If you leave me)
What a heartache, for Heaven's sake
(Don't you need me?)
Don't leave me blue of wanting you
(How could I live?)
Don't be untrue, what could I do?

[Chorus 1]
Don't you know you
You gave me the world, little girl
When you gave me your love
So if you take your love
You take my world with you too

[Verse 2]
Hey, look at me, now can't you see
(Tears in my eyes?)
Hear what I say, stay here, I pray
(Never leave me)
Why must I plead, you know I need
(All your loving)
Don't put me down, keep me around

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
And I say, baby
Hey, pretty little baby
Don't leave me baby
Pretty little baby

[Verse 3]
Darling, you give me joy, am I your toy?
(Cracked and broken)
I always share your every care
(Wishing, hoping)
All through the years, we have no fears
(Now I'm crying)
You leave the tears falling for years

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Baby please, baby
Pretty little baby
