Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
Sing it over
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
See the little baby
Wrapped in a manger
On Christmas morning

Singing in a temple
Talking with the elders
Tomorrow there's wisdom

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
Hallelujah
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
Down at the Jordan
John was baptizing
And saving all sinners

See him at the seaside
Talking with the fisherman
And made them disciples

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
Keep on pushin' now
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
Hallelujah now
Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen
