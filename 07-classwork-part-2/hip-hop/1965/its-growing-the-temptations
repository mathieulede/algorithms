Like a snow ball rolling down the side of a snow covered hill (it's growing)
Like the size of the fish that the man claims broke his reel (it's growing)
Like the rose bud blooming in the warmth of the summer sun (it's growing)
Like the tale by the time its been told by more than one (it's growing)

Every day it grows a little more then it was the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Ooooh how it grows and grows
And where it's going to stop I'm sure nobody knows
Hey, hey, hey
(nobody knows)
How it grows and it grows and it grows
(nobody knows)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(nobody knows it grows and grows where is it gonna stop)
Oooo

Like the need in a guy to see his girl when she's gone away (its growing)
Like the sadness in his little heart when he knows that she's gone to stay Ooo (it's growing)

Every day it grows a little more than it was the day before
My love for you just grows and grows
Ooooh how it grows and grows
And where it's going to stop I'm sure nobody knows
(hey,hey,hey nobody knows)
It gets a little wider (nobody knows)
Aw it gets a little stronger (hey,hey,hey)
The feeling from each kiss baby (hey,hey,hey)
Aw it last a litter longer (hey,hey,hey)
Ooo so much OooOoo so much
Can't you see us growing baby
It grows and it grows and it grows
