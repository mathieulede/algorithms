[Intro]
The name game. Shirley! Shirley, Shirley

Bo-ber-ley, bo-na-na fanna

Fo-fer-ley. fee fi mo-mer-ley, Shirley!



[Verse 1]
Lincoln! Lincoln, Lincoln. bo-bin-coln

Bo-na-na fanna, fo-fin-coln

Fee fi mo-min-coln, Lincoln!



[Verse 2]
Come on ev'rybody, I say now let's play a game

I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name

The first letter of the name

I treat it like it wasn't there

But a "B" or an "F" or an "M" will appear;

And then I say "Bo" add a "B" then I say the name

Then "Bo-na-na fanna" and "fo"

And then I say the name again with an ""f" very plain

Then "fee fi" and a "mo"

And then I say the name again with an "M" this time

And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme



[Verse 3]
Arnold! Arnold, Arnold bo-bar-nold

Bo-na-na, fanna fo-far-nold

Fee fi m-mar-mold. Arnold!



[Verse 4]
But if the first two letters are ever the same

Crop them both, then say the name

Like Bob, Bob, drop the "B's", Bo-ob

Or Fred, Fred, drop the "F's", Fo-red

Or Mary, Mary, drop the "M's", Mo-ary

That's the only rule that is contrary

And then I say "Bo" add a "B" then I say the name

Then "Bo-na-na fanna" and "fo"

And then I say the name again with an ""f" very plain

Then "fee fi" and a "mo"

And then I say the name again with an "M" this time

And there isn't any name that I can't rhyme


[Verse 5]
Say Tony, Tony, bo-bo-ney

Bo-na-na fanna, fo-fo-ney

Fee fi mo-mo-ney, Tony!


[Verse 5]
