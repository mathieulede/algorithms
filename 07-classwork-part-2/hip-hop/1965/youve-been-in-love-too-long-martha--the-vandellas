Girls, you've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)
Don't you know girls?
You've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)

When just his smile takes all your pain away
And you find yourself believing whatever he may say
Now when he keeps you cryin'
But your heart tells you, girl, keep right on tryin'

Girls, you've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)
Don't you know, girls?
You've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)

When you accept his wrongs
Just to share his kiss
And even your lonely nights
Are filled with happiness

Now girl, you're in trouble
You know your heart is seein' double
When your head tells you to run
But your heart says he's the only one

Girls, you've been in love too long
You're a fool for your baby
(Girl, you've been in love too long)
You're a fool 'cause when a week of loneliness
Can be erased with just one sweet caress

Girls, you've been in love too long
(You're a fool for your baby)
I say girls, oh yeah, you're a fool
When his wrongs looks right
'Cause he always treats you bad

When you find little excuses
For all the sadness and abuses
Don't you know, girls you're in love?
You're just a fool for your baby
