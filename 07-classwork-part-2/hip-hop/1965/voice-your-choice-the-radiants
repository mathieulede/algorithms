Voice your choice

Voice your choice
Tell me who do you love
Am I the one, oh... Oh...

You know you look so good
Oh, oh, it's really a crime
For just one girl
Yeah, to be so fine

You've got all the boys
Standing in line

Who's the last but not the least
So come on now
Girl, speak your peace
Speak your peace

Tell me, girl, what you're gonna do
And tell me what you are trying to prove

No, when one will do
So come on now, say it's me and you
Me and you
