Kickin' at the gravel in the parking lot
Runnin' cross the street to the record shop
Talkin' to my buddy 'bout some hip-hop tune
Hotter than a firework and it's still June

Sun's about to burn itself right outta the sky
Guess we'll all be lucky if we don't fry
And the preacher's baptizing at the river bend
Wash the dust off of Dixie start all over again

It was Saturday night and I swore I'd never leave her
We had the Hossman blastin' on the radio receiver
They say history plays tricks she's a real deceiver
She gave me something from her heart back then
Made me a true believer

Yeah, and I believed every little word we said
Whisper through the sycamores in my head
Did we really drive her daddy's truck across Dry Creek
Well, my hands started shakin' as my knees went weak

Then we pulled back in the woods and shut the headlights off
Aw, girl how'd you ever get your hair so soft
I can't see what I'm doin' don't know if I should
I can't see what I'm doin' Lord it sure feels good

It was Saturday night and I swore I'd never leave her
We had the Hossman blastin' on the radio receiver
They say history plays tricks she's a real deceiver
She gave me something from her heart back then
Made me a true believer

I'm a true believer and I'm lookin' for a sign
That she can still hear this heart of mine
Beatin' to the rhythm of the rock and roll
I'm a true believer that the girl's got soul

Now I'm back in Alabama by that river bend
Where that preacher's baptizing his flock again
Now we had some bad times and a little luck
And her daddy gave us that old pick-up truck

And we drove it on up to Birmingham
And we bought ourselves a pair of matching wedding bands
Hey Lord, that was almost twenty-eight years ago
And we still got the Hossman on the radio

It was Saturday night and I swore I'd never leave her
We had the Hossman blastin' on the radio receiver
They say history plays tricks she's a real deceiver
She gave me something from her heart back then
Made me a true believer

True Believer
A true believer
She made me a true believer
Yes, I'm a true believer...
