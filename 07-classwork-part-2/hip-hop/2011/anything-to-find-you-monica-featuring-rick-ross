[Monica:]
Likes sweet morning dew
I took one look at you
And it was plain to see
You were my destiny

[Rick Ross:]
We the big bank boys on the boulevard
Putting all the pretty girls into pretty cars
They shall not fuck with rozay pockets
Feel the honey shots when I pop it
I feel for you, vodka, rum on my arm
20 million Teflon Don, god bless
All the D boys on the rise
With my baby girl on my side, baby, baby

[Monica:]
I've been looking for someone special for a long, long time
Someone that I can share my dream, someone I can call mine
And every night I'm wishing, hoping, that he's only getting closer
Cause I'm, oh I'm gonna find you, want to know you

And I just wanna know if someone's out there
Somebody to hold, somebody who cares
I'll do anything to find you (and when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no
I'd do anything to find you (and when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no

I've been there so many times from the guys in my past
And when I find somebody new, it don't never lasts
And every night I'm wishing, hoping, that he's only getting closer
Cause I'm, oh I'm gonna find you, want to know you

When I just wanna know if someone's out there
Somebody to hold, somebody who cares
I'll do anything to find you (and when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no
I'd do anything to find you (and when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no

[Lil' Kim:]
Who shot ya? Pow!
I guess it was cupid
Bow and arrow through the heart, let the blood drip
Somebody call the doctor cause I'm love-sick
Man, I done had it with this love shit
I'm done, just cause you make me cum, don't mean that you're the one
Most dudes only good for their tongue
Fucking with the queen bee it ain't safe
I'll leave the stinger in your face

[Monica:]
And I'm tired of being by myself
I need someone there, to give all of this love that I got
I'm open, won't you come inside?
Man, I promise that I will treat you better than right

Gotta know
Is he out there some where, is he out there waiting for me, for me?
Is he out there some where, is he out there waiting for me?

I just wanna know if someone's out there
Somebody to hold, somebody who cares
I'll do anything to find you (and when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no
I'd do anything to find you (and when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no

I just wanna know if someone's out there
Somebody to hold, somebody who cares
I'll do anything to find you (and when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no
I'd do anything to find you (and when I do)
I won't let you go, no, no
