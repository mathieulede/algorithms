[Intro]
Jesus in the area, DJ Kevin on the track
And guess what, we back again
I shine, you shine
I shine, you shine
Forever, eva
Forever, eva
Forever, eva

[Refrain x2: Anthony David and Algebra]
Forever more
Forever's a mighty long time and I really wanna spend it with you
I shine when you shine and there's really no substitute

[Anthony David]
Take a picture, I want you to remember
When I professed my love
Press the button, I hope it's still recording
Every word I'm sayin' to you
I'm telling you right now from this day on
Already weighed up the pros and cons
Tellin' ya, you're just the woman I want (I want)
I want (I want), I want (I want)
Makin' my plans just to be with you
Just you and me babe 'till the days are through
And I ain't ashamed love, to say I do
I do

[Refrain]

[Algebra]
Pick a tree to carve our names
Let the world know it's not a game
Last longer than a wedding ring
Generations tattooed with the love we bring
From the seeds we sow
To the time it takes to grow
Long enough to show you
I won't let go of you
Cause without you I'm incomplete
Like this love song without this beat
I'm saying that you are the man I need (I need)
I need (I need), I need (yeah-heey)
I'm making my plans just to be with you
Just you and me babe till the days are through
And I ain't ashamed love, to say I do (I do)
I do (I do), I do (I do)

[Refrain]

[Phonte]
Uh, yeah, it's Phontigga, yo
Take a picture off the wall, try to reframe it
Take all the color off, try to repaint it
If you want picture perfect, well we ain't it
Because we painted our own portrait
Of me and you that could never be tainted
Because real love and bodies are colors of the spectrum
Mix a few greens with your reds and your blues
Create some new hues, then you rehang it
Start over, even though your friends gon' doubt you
And all them other niggas tryna scout you
It gets so tiring, but I'd be lying
If I said that I'd be better off without you
And when I think of walking out you
Smile in a way that make me feel like I'd be lost without you
Me and you are the only threats to us
Till death do us I'm standing next to ya

[Refrain]
