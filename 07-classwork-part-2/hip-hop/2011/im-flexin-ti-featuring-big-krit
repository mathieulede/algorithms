Yeah, it’s the King, cuh
You know my demo, Maybach, no limo, homes
I’m sacked up, too
I don’t know what them folk doin’
I’m flexin’, tho’, patna
There it go, K.R.I.T.!

[Hook: Big KRIT & T.I.]
(Hold it now) I'm flexin, shawty
(Hold it now) I'm stupid, ho
(Hold it now) I rep it shawty
(Hold it now) Bitch you ain't know?
(Hold it now) I'm Gucci'd parnter
(Hold it now) I'm Louis'd down
Don't do it partner
(Hold it now) Or it's going down

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I wear Strivers Row my Louis ho
AKOO be matching my kicks, bitch
Paparazzi everywhere I go
Got cameras all in my business
I rep the town, hold it down
Cruise all around in my old school
My speakers loud and my reefer too
I ain't speaking, bitch, do I know you?
Feds want me back behind that wall
It's the only place that I can't go
I'm focused dog, I ain't with that fuck shit
Think it’s sweet but it ain’t though
I'm tried and true when I'm riding through
I ain't hiding they can just hate me
My top is down and my pockets fat
And my diamonds clearer than HD

[Hook: Big KRIT & T.I.]
(Hold it now) I'm flexin, shawty
(Hold it now) I'm stupid, ho
(Hold it now) I rep it shawty
(Hold it now) Bitch you ain't know?
(Hold it now) I'm Gucci'd parnter
(Hold it now) I'm Louis'd down
Don't do it partner
(Hold it now) Or it's going down

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I rep the west of that A like this
Zone 1 I'm talkin' bout Bankhead
Still in the trap like a goddamn brick
Cause I love the hood, the king ain't dead
My hustle grand my money long
My spot on top, bitch I want that
My position vacant, my crown await
My throne is empty, I own that
Folks to Kirkwood and Ben Hill too
Summerhill to Pittsburgh and all that
Real goons will ride with me to Timbuktu
If I ain't Gucci'd, dude, what'd you called that?
Marietta, East Point to Ole Nat L
Riverdale to Center Hill all day
Decatur to Simpson Road Zone 4
4th Ward, nigga fuck with me always

[Hook: Big KRIT & T.I.]
(Hold it now) I'm flexin, shawty
(Hold it now) I'm stupid, ho
(Hold it now) I rep it shawty
(Hold it now) Bitch you ain't know?
(Hold it now) I'm Gucci'd parnter
(Hold it now) I'm Louis'd down
Don't do it partner
(Hold it now) Or it's going down

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Them so-called dope boys ain't sold enough
OGs ain't old enough
MCs ain't dope enough
I still split your coconut
You so-so, I'm like that
Tight work bounce right back
Make room for your bitch, dawg
Nigga go on get off my sack
That loud pack I blow big
Always stunt so big
Please don't get wrong homie
Or them Gs gon bust your wig
The A is mine, no questions asked
The king home, bitch the best is back
My swag is turnt just like my sack
I'm flexin' shawty who's stopping that?

[Hook: Big KRIT & T.I.]
(Hold it now) I'm flexin, shawty
(Hold it now) I'm stupid, ho
(Hold it now) I rep it shawty

[T.I.]
Okay, man, you don’t see what’s in yo’ face, big dog?
Yeah, man, big banks, no whammies, dog, you understand that?
Yeah, doin’ real, I’m talkin’ ’bout real proper, patna?
You understand that? I got that sack, bruh!
Prison ain’t changed shit, homeboy
