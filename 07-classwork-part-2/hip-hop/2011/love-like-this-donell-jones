Ooh, don't worry baby girl, 'cause I got it bad for you
You won't hurt no more
It's okay if your heart ain't ready
But, girl, I can't leave you alone

I wanna be the love of your life
Don't be scared

Ooh, I admit I used to be the same hood that you're scared of
Outta control
Tried to hit every woman that I came in contact with
Out on the road

But I got it out of my system, girl, I did that when I was young
I need somebody that's gon' hold me down
Cross my heart, you'll be the only one
Don't be scared

Girl, I'll love you every minute
Ooh, girl, there's no doubt about it
You just can't keep running from love

Ooh, girl, I'm willing to show
How you been dolin' out poison
Ooh, take a chance and give me your lovin'
Baby, only good love, baby, don't you be
