[Intro: Big Sean]
Boy
Kelly, I'ma make you call me B.I.G

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Last night we made a movie, and tonight will be the sequel
Send a pic, let a nigga get a preview
Come and suit it up, on my GQ
And I'ma make you take it off with your teeth too
Nasty, tonight we skinny dipping, no pool girl
Except the one between your legs, I'm a fool girl
Put your skirt on, turn you to my school girl
Smack you with my ruler girl, you know how I do it girl

[Hook: Kelly Rowland]
Lay it on me baby lay it on me
Ohh lay it on me
Lay it on me baby lay it on me
Ohh lay it on me
Lay it on me put it down on me oh
Put your hands on my body
Lay it on me lay it on me
Now, now lay it on me

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
What time do you get out, I wanna see you tonight
What time will you be here, I wanna hold you tonight
I wanna just kiss you now
I wanna just touch you now
I wanna just give you all my love tonight

[Pre-Hook: Kelly Rowland]
And tell them you won't be here in the morning oh no
Tell your little friends that you're rolling solo
Tonight boy make my body go ohh
Lay it on me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland]
I don't mind, I can wait up, cause I wanna enjoy the ride
And I know when you show up, I'ma be satisfied
So come come lay me down
One more time around
Boy just give me all that love tonight

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Lay it down d-down down d-down down down
Lay it down d-down down d-down down down
Lay it down d-down down d-down down down
Ohh oh lay it down
Lay it down d-down down d-down down down (Lay it Down)
Lay it down d-down down d-down down down (B.I.G. I Do It)
Lay it down d-down down d-down down down (Sean Don)
Ohh lay it on me (Yeah)

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
The king of the California kings, you gotta call me sire
Watch me lay it down and I ain't even tired
Putting work in and I ain't even hired
Hitting high notes, neighbours thought you joined a choir
She drop it then wind with it cause she know that I'm liking it
Turn my lab into a chaffeur and I'll spend all day just riding it
Tryna clone that just to have a menage with it
Just a red light special but I swear there ain't no stopping this
Yelling go Sean go, said shawty bring it back
Call my dick "Curiousity" cause it killed the cat
And satisfaction brought it back
Girl it's your world, I'm just chilling on the map sayin'

[Hook][x2]

[Outro]
Lay it lay it on me
L-l-l-lay it on me
Lay it on me
