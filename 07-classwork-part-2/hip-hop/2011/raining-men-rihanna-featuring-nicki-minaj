[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo
Catch a playa by the toe
If you want him, let him go
Ladies don’t worry cause they got plenty more

[Hook - Rihanna]
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Oh its raining men girl what you worry ’bout

[Verse 1]
Who you think you getting with that "Hi let me freak ya"?
You got me mistaken thinking you gon get it easy
First of all you got to know that I’m not the one
Think you getting something baby, you ain't getting none
All you need to know that I’m a 2 X 5
Load it, cock it, aim it baby, boom bye bye
Set your standards lower baby you’re aiming too high
Matter of fact your friend looks better, so good bye

Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out

Oh yeah yeah
Oh whoa whoa

[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj]
Excuse me, but who are you fixin' to be?
Let them muthafuckas know there’s plenty fish in the sea
And he sweatin' me just ‘cause I got the tightest hole
But I couldn’t find that th-thing with a microscope
Give me dome, dome, da-da-da-da-da-dome, dome, dome
I ain’t trippin’ on your money, money, long, long, long
Want my own TV production company
So tell Harpo to hit me, Celie
Anyway, RiRi, what rhymes with your name freely?
Money got you vacationing in Chile
Do you wanna sit on the back while I wheelie?
Really? Really? No, for real, really?
Laid out on the beach, they be feeding me my catfishes
‘Cause it’s raining men, fat bitches

[Hook - Rihanna]
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Oh its raining men girl what you worry ’bout

[Verse 3 - Rihanna]
I said ay, outta my way, with my ladies
I'm living good, doing big things
Dancing; don't pay, player keep the money
I can buy my own drink
Up in the club, see me coming
Dime a dozen so it don’t mean nothing to me
And I ain't even worried about you
Cause there’s plenty more fish in the sea

[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo

[Hook - Rihanna]
Men be falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Falling like the rain so we ain't running out
Oh its raining men girl what you worry ’bout
