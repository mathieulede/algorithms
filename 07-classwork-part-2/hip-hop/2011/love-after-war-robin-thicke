[Intro]
Love after war
Love after war
Love after war
Love after war

[Verse 1]
Ooh it's a knockout baby, you won the fight
I said "I'm sorry that I acted like a selfish child"
Please forgive me baby, I was out of line
You know I can make it right, don't you love it when we fight

[Hook]
Love after war
(Ooh I need you tonight, baby)
Love after war
(Come in and let me make it right, baby)
Love after war
(Ooh I'm knocking on your door)
Love after war
(You know I want it, you know I want that)

[Verse 2]
Caught in lies, girls cry, doors slam and broken lights
Bottles hit the TV screen, "You gotta go or I'm gonna leave"
Throwing clothes into the yard, when we go we go so hard
It only makes me want you more, more, more and more

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Love after war
(I just wanna love you lady)
Love after war
(We're gonna put down our weapons, baby)
Love after war
(Lay your guns down on the floor, love)
Love after war
(And give me some love after war, baby)
Love after war
(You know it's gonna be all night)
Love after war
(You know the way that we fight, baby)
Love after war
(Ooh just drink this glass of wine)
Love after war
(And girl, remember you're mine, baby)
Love after war
(Remember you're mine, baby
C'mon and let me in, baby)
Love after war
(You know I want it)

[Outro]
You know I want you, babe
You know I want you, baby
You know I want you, babe
You know I want you, baby
