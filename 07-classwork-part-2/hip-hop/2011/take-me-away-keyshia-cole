I love my baby, I love my baby
So ready
I love my baby, I love my baby

Well, it's a new hit for radio
Just another jam for the dance floor
Really get it in if you didn't know
I gotta whole new thing going on
Break bread if you want talk too
Cause leaving you is what I won't do
I'm in love with you completely
And ain't nobody else out there for me (for me)

[Bridge:]
A couple shots of patron
But I ain't drinking all alone
I got to have you with me
Up in the V.I.P
Everything we do B.I.G
And I'ma keep it real till I D.I.E
Okay (okay)
Let's go (let's go)
I'm with it (I'm with it)
And you know (you know)
And you got it (you got it)
And I'm ready (so ready)

[Chorus:]
I'm so in love with you
No lie, I'm telling the truth
I'm your woman
Now baby take me away
See you in everything I do
That's why I'm so wrapped up in you
I'm your woman
Now baby take me away
Take me away
I love my baby, I love my baby
(I'm ready, so ready)
Take me away
I love my baby, I love my baby

I just wanna see you in the morning
Cause loving you is easy as I'm dreaming
Everyday feels like a weekend
I finally found you and I'm seeking
Feels like I wanna be close to you
And do all the things that lovers do
Your love be getting me higher
Cause boy you got that fire, fire

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
