[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when I pulled out that gun
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum
Man Down!
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum
Man Down!

[Chorus]
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station

[Verse 2]
It's a 22, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
Whatchu expect me to do?
If you're playing me for a fool, I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But its too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking, now he's no longer living
So I'm bout to leave town, aye uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when I pulled out that gun
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum
Man Down!
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum
Man Down!

[Chorus]
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
(Criminal) In central station

[Bridge]
Look, I'd never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it!
Oh gosh, what ever happened to me
Ever happened to me, ever happened to me?
Why did I pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger? Boom!
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon?
When mi pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull it pon' you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do? Ehh

Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum
Mi say wah man down (a weh mi say)
Rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum, rum bum bum bum
When mi went downtown

Cause now I'mma criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh lord a mercy, now I am a criminal
Man Down
Tell the judge please gimme minimal
Run out a town none a dem cah see mi now

[Chorus]
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down In central station, in front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama I just shot a man down
In central station
