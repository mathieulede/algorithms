[Intro: Twista]
The Perfect Storm, it's Twista and Chris Brown, ya dig?
I got a new one for ya, let's make a movie baby

[Verse 1: Twista]
Twista got cars, big swagger, I'm a rock star like Mick Jagger
And I got bars that I spit faster, you a hot star no bitch badder
So let me take you on a ride on a journey with the one that you call daddy, who gonna make you get it wet
But this time we gon' do something romantic and different, I'll tell you about it when we get on the movie set
I was thinking that we could just make a sex tape, plus I think yo face cute when it's in HD
Maybe I could tape you and you could tape me, when I pull my H2 up to your H3
You look like you want to be in this movie, so don't be acting like a tripping with a stranger mission
Recording you while you loving me down below, switching the camera angle when we change positions
You could be the director aiming the camera down at me, filming me licking until you say "Cut"
Ready for any footage you wanna get ain't gotta call nobody else because I do my own stunts
It's the X rated version of a box office hit, I see you ready to strip for this
So let me get the music in, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh oh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby we don't need no script for this
I'mma throw a couple thousand baby strip for this
Let me pull my camera out and make a movie yeah
Starring you and me yeah
Baby we don't need no actresses
Let me see what I'm working with, I'mma break your back with this
Let me pull my camera out let's make a movie yeah
Starring you and me yeah yeah, girl

[Verse 2: Twista]
Shawty we gonna make a movie, got me loving it when I'm feeling on the booty
Especially when I can blame it on the alcohol, cause it do some thing to me
She look better than any chick in my perimeter, sexy, I wish I could film every bit of her
Kissing right down to her stomach and then I'mma, tell her we could be in our personal cinema
I let you hold the camera first and then I hold it then, cause I wanna see how it's coming out and going in
Let you see such a freak in me. I hope this never leak on TMZ, this is 50 World Star or CNN
Baby girl you kick the world off the axis, I'm no director, filming you for practice
And you know I think you a hell of a actress, especially when I'm shooting you on a mattress
Shawty straight to the top that's where we headed and I'mma see my name in the credits and be the shit if you let it
See something that you not really feeling, then we can always go back and make an edit
I'll be sipping on patron platinum, she knew about the rapping, but didn't know I'd be on acting
Our personal reality show, so there, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh oh)

[Chorus]
