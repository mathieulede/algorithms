[Intro: Prodigy]
Dang, we text each other a lot

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Hey, my girl, my girl, she loves me
She hit me all the time, she be texting me
Hey, my girl, my girl, she loves me
She hit me all the time

[Interlude: Roc Royal]
Yo Prod', let 'em know

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
When I say hey, then you say what's up?
And I'll be like baby, do you miss me?
When you say yes, then I'll say ditto
Then you hit me back, with the less than symbol number three

[Pre-Chorus: Prodigy]
I got a clue how you feel for me
1-4-3 a smiley with a wink
That's how you feel baby that's what's up
A hundred forty characters, is more than enough

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Hey, my girl, my girl, she loves me
I know I'm on her mind even when we don't speak
Say, my girl, my girl, she loves me
She hit me all the time my phone be ringing off the hook like, yeaahhh
She hit me all the time my phone be ringing off the hook like, yeaahhh
She hit me all the time - She text me all the time

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
When you say yo, then I'll say hey love
You hit me with a sad face, what I do?
I hit you with a question mark
You send me back a J slash K, said I'm just playing with you

[Pre-Chorus: Prodigy]
I got a clue how you feel for me
1-4-3 a smiley with a wink
That's how you feel baby thats what's up
A hundred forty characters is more than enough

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Hey, my girl, my girl, she loves me
I know I'm on her mind even when we don't speak
Say, my girl, my girl, she loves me
She hit me all the time, my phone be ringing off the hook like, yeaahhh
She hit me all the time my phone be ringing off the hook like, yeaahhh
She hit me all the time my phone be ringing off the hook like

[Bridge: Prodigy]
She text me after school, she do it like it's homework
Up in the salon, she do it like it's homework
My girl's in love, I think I'm in love
I wonder what she texted now

[Verse 3: Roc Royal]
Oh, oh, let me get it, Prod'
Me and my girlfriend, we go out every weekend
We just two love-birds, that's why we're always tweeting
I tell her all my secrets, she tell me all of hers
When we get off the phone, she says, "No you hang up first!"
My girl is my universe, I am so in love with her
All the money in the world can't even compare to what my shawty's worth
They call me Double R, from Mindless Behavior
Oh, that's my girl calling, I'll holla at you later!

[Chorus: Prodigy]
Hey, my girl, my girl, she loves me
I know I'm on her mind even when we don't speak
Say, my girl, my girl, she loves me
She hit me all the time, my phone be ringing off the hook like, yeaahhh
She hit me all the time my phone be ringing off the hook like, yeaahhh
She hit me all the time my phone be ringing off the hook like
