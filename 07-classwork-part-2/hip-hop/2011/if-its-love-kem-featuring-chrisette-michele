I’m sitting here in my bed
I’ve been thinking about everything that’s been said
I realize what’s at stake
From the moment I met you
I just ain’t been the same

I need you here in my life
And we both know, that’s a hard thing to find
Girl, I’m a good man and you’re a good woman
There’s so much more I want to discover, baby

If it’s love, it’ll last a lifetime
Deep in my heart, I know baby
If it’s love, it last forever
It’ll just start to show

You know I played the field for the longest time
Was in and out of love
Oh I, oh I paid the price
Tell me can you comprehend what you make me feel
Heaven only knows why broken hearts can heal

I need you, here by my side
If you’re not in my world, boy
Ain’t nothing right
You’re a good man, and I’m a good woman too
There’s so much more to discover with you

If it’s love, it’ll last a lifetime
Deep in my heart, I know baby
If it’s love,girl, it last forever
It’ll just start to show

Maybe we can work it out
Maybe we can find the time
Maybe we can settle down, girl
Boy, you know your heart is mine

Maybe we can find a way to love a little better
Maybe we can a way to keep it all together
Maybe have a little faith and pray for this love, love

If it’s love, hey girl, it’ll last a lifetime
Deep in my heart, I know... I know
If it’s love, it last forever
It’ll just start to show Baby LaDeDaDaDa

If it's Love Girl, Baby
Baby I know LaDeDaDaDa If it's Love Girl,Baby
Hey Girl...(If it's Love)
