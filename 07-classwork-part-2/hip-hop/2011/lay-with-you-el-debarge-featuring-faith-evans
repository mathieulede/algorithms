Oh baby, ah baby, oh yeah

I just wanna lay right here with you
Baby I just wanna lay with you

I know you have work
But I would love for you
To stay with me
For a little while longer
I'm asking a lot
But I don't want you to go away
Cause I can't get you out of my mind girl

I could just look at you (all day long)
Your beautiful smile I just (can't go wrong)
If only you didn't have to leave
You could relax and chill with me

Let's not leave the house today
I just wanna lay with you
With your body close to mine
Room service will be on the way
I just wanna lay with you
Can't get enough of you (girl)

Oh baby, you're making it hard for me to leave
Wish I didn't have to go
So next time around let's hope it rains
So we can just stay in
Cause I just wanna lay with you

I could just look at you (all day along)
Your beautiful smile, I just (can't go wrong)

If only you didn't have to leave
We could relax and just chill in these sheets

Let's not leave the house today
I just wanna lay with you
With your body close to mine
Room service will be on the way
I just wanna lay with you (I wanna lay with you baby)
Can't get enough of you (girl)

Oh, one night with you is like heaven (like heaven)
I don't wanna go from here, oh baby
Kissing your neck while you?re sleeping (sleeping)
Love when you need

Let's not leave the house today
I just wanna lay with you
(Baby I just wanna lay yeah baby)
Room service will be on the way
I just wanna lay with you
(Can I can I can I lay)

Let's not leave the house today
I just wanna lay with you baby
Baby I just wanna lay with you

I just wanna lay right here with you
I just wanna lay right here with you
I just wanna lay right here with you
Can I lay with you
