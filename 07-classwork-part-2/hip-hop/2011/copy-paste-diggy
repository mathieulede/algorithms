They act like I don't see 'em but (ohhh)

Don't come any closer, you might step on my toe, just
Ladies it's your jam leave your jacket on the sofa
Have a little class, put your glass on the coaster
Get it on the floor shake it
Shake it like you're supposed to if you know getting over
Tell 'em copy copy over

Keep me on the job and they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
I'm on and I be in my zone when they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me

Copy paste, copy copy paste
Everything that I do they tryna do the same (the same thing)
Copy paste, copy copy paste

Keep me on the job and they be tryna
Copy and paste me, copy and paste me

Copy and paste me, copy and paste me
