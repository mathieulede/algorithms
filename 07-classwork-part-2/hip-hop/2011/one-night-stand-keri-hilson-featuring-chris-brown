[Intro: Keri Hilson]
Men go slow

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & Chris Brown]
You should stay another night with me
A one night stand is all I need, just you and me
You should stay another night with me
A one night stand is all I need

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
Tell me how you like it, baby
Do you want it fast or slow?
'Cause I get so excited, baby
When you're taking off my clothes
Time and time again I done tried to be the girl in your life
Boy, I know you're feeling lonely
So if you want it, boy, just come over, boy
And I promise you will never want to leave, oh yeah

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & Chris Brown]
You should stay another night with me
A one night stand is all I need, just you and me
You should stay another night with me
A one night stand is all I need

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Keri Hilson]
Tell me how it feels, when your man don't please you right
And tell me how it feels, after I take you on this ride
Ooh, I got the remedy, girl, I'll be your fantasy
Girl, I'ma kiss from your head to your feet, yeah, satisfaction guaranteed, woah
Girl, I didn't come to tease ya, I just want to please ya
Hope you like this
I know you want to be loved, maybe we can make some
Boy, I think that you should stay

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & Chris Brown]
You should stay another night with me, I just want your body, baby
A one night stand is all I need, just you and me
Baby, you, you should stay another night with me, stay until the morning comes
Stay until the morning comes, a one night stand is all I need

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Baby, he ain't treating you right
And I know he ain't hitting it right
That's why you need me in your life, baby
Come here, let me kiss on your neck
Down to your chest
To your navel
I'ma go all the way
So stay here for another night

[Outro: Keri Hilson & Chris Brown]
You should stay another night with me
A one night is all I need
