I dedicate this song to recession
Depression and unemployment
This song's for you

Today's a new day, and there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me
You tell me it's alright

(I'll be honest with you)
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower

(When I think how much better I'm gonna be when this is over)
I smile, even though I'm hurt see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile..
It's so hard to look up when you look down
Sure would hate to see it when you give up now
You look so much better when you smile, so smile

Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, tell me where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me
You tell me it's alright

(the truth is)
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower

I smile, even though I'm hurt see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile..
It's so hard to look up when you look down
Sure would hate to see it when you give up now
You look so much better when you smile

Smile.. for me
Can you just smile... for me
Smile.. for me
Can you just smile... for me

Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
(and while your waiting)
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
(and while your praying)
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
(look in the mirror)
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
(always remember)
You look so much better when you smile

I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower

I smile, even though I'm hurt see I smile
I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while
I smile, smile..
It's so hard to look up when you look down
Sure would hate to see it when you give up now
You look so much better when you smile
So smile

Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Ohohoh you look so much better when you
Smile...

I just want you to be happy..
I want you to have joy cause can't nobody
Take that away from you
I see you.. SMILE!!
