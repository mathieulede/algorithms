It's sad that memories never die
Just fill your head with why
Then you're caught living a lie again

It's sad that all he ever said
Was that he loved me to death
But then he's gone again
And I was wrong again

[Chorus]
Cause you think it's easier
Easy like that
Just when I wasn't finished
You were gone like that
Can't you hear me crying
Cause I need you back
Cause I'm slowly dying
Cause I need you bad
But you're gone and never coming back
Gone and not coming back
He's never coming back

Shoulda known
The long kiss goodbye
Would bring sadness in my life
Wearing this disguise again
I wish that you would have said
Or lied to me instead
Like a bullet to my head
Like a fool I pretend
That it's on again
On again

[Chorus]
Cause you think it's easier
Easy like that
Just when I wasn't finished
You were gone like that
Can't you hear me crying
Cause I need you back
And I'm slowly dying
Cause I need you bad
But you're gone and never coming back
Gone and not coming back
He's never coming back

[Bridge]
Who ever said look on the brighter side
Has never been on mine
Who ever said that he'll get his
Never felt like this
Ain't no use in crying
When you're done like that
Cause baby, baby you took something
That I can't buy back

And now you're gone and never coming back
Coming back
Ooh he's not coming back
