Damn, doll, do change ya all?
I'm your number fan belt they are not important
I don't use a cordless, microphone
They don't feel real to me
Meaning real woman
Others ?
You my ? green box When I couldn't afford a Ford
Clean socks scootin' across the floor in your grandmama house
Hand on your mouth
You yap too much about the penny, mechanic so uncanny
X-men, x-men
Your ex boyfirend should thank me that I took you off his hands
No I can't bring another beach to the sand
And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
And get what you need without saying please
But can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they put this man's Grammy's on the street?
What? Why so quiet?
Hate that all of our memories happened in a Hyatt
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way different, you think I don't remember
Shit, the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you don't even know got you in bed
Bet Your Buddy Dont Even Know You Don't Like Red
Or Was It Fuchsia, Fuck It, Our Future Is Dead
[Lil Wayne]
