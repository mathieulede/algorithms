Let me get this out the way
So there ain't no complications
Later on for us, no

But I know things don't stay the same
People grow and seasons change
But when it comes to love

Don't you feel like
You ever gotta worry about my
Feelings changing for you over time
Cause when I say I care, girl, I mean it

So when the world
And the odds are against us
You won't have to question
The answer is yes

When two or three years from now
You start having some doubts
'Bout if this love will last
The answer is yes

I'll still think you're beautiful
Cause I'm more attracted to what's inside of you
You don't have to guess
The answer is yes

Cause I love you (I love you)
All I care about is your happiness
So the answer is yes

People just don't stick around (no)
Build you up and let you down
But I am not one of those, no

I understand that you've been burned (before)
Honesty is what you deserve (so much more)
Yeah, and so that's what I am giving you, girl (giving you, girl)

So when the world
And the odds are against us
You won't have to question
The answer is yes

When two or three years from now
You start having some doubts
'Bout if this love will last
The answer is yes

I'll still think you're beautiful
Cause I'm more attracted to what's inside of you
You don't have to guess
The answer is yes

Now if you ask will I go (no)
When you need me most (no)
The answer is no
I'm dedicated to what we have

But will I be here
The way that I promised?
I'll say with no fear
The answer is yes

When two or three years from now
You start having some doubts
'Bout if this love will last
The answer is yes

And I'll still think you're beautiful
Cause I'm more attracted to what's inside of you
You don't have to guess
The answer is yes

When two or three years from now
You start having some doubts
'Bout if this love will last
The answer is yes

I'll still think you're beautiful
Cause I'm more attracted to what's inside of you
You don't have to guess
The answer is yes
