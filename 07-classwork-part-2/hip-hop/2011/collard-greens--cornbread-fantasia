[Verse 1]
Yesterday I cursed you and told you that I was thru
But today I'm with you
Ain't that some love
Tomorrow you might hate me and find you somebody new
But today I'm with you
Ain't that some love

[Hook]
Ain gon lie, boy you got me out of my mind in L.O.V.E
I go crazy when you love me
Got me acting a mess
Even got the nerve to say I'm better than my momma
Collard greens and cornbread yea [repeat]

[Verse 2]
I never put up with bs from anyone
But I take it from you
Ain't that some love
And I never had no one put me through what you do
But as long as it's you
That's some real love

[Hook]
Oh ain gon lie, boy you got me out of my mind in L.O.V.E
I go crazy when you love me
Got me acting a mess
Even got the nerve to say I'm better than my momma
Collard greens and cornbread yea [repeat]

[Bridge:]
Baby
And you're my sweet potato pie
Sugar
You know you are
Oh.....
Sugar
And I can't get enough of you
Boy I'm crazy bout what you do

[Hook]
Ain gon lie, boy you got me out of my mind in l.o.v.e
I go crazy when you love me
Got me acting a mess
Even got the nerve to say I'm better than my momma
Collard greens and cornbread yea [4x]
Hey Baby
