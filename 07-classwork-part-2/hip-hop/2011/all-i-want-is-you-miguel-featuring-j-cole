[Verse 1: J. Cole]

Damn, Cole World
I never thought I see that day that you my ol' girl
Now I’m stuck here hollerin' at old girl
Got one, Got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut one, Hut two, told them niggas take a hike
Then it’s on to the next one on on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

[Verse 2: Miguel]
I wonder sometimes, I wonder if I was wrong
Tryin' do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone
Cause her eyes
Those hips
And that ass
Don’t compare at all, no
And at best all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

[Hook: Miguel]
All I want is you
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3: Miguel]
'Cuz being your friend is killin' me softly
I hear voices
Wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault
And the wrong time
I wonder so often
Regret gets exhausted

Cause her eyes
Those hips
And that ass
Don’t compare at all, no
And at best all they do is distract me but now
Deep down when I face it

[Hook: Miguel]
All I want is you
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone

All I want is you
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone

[Verse 4: Miguel]

'Cuz they don’t smile or smell like you
'N' they don’t make me laugh or even cook like you
'N' they don’t photograph, nah they don't sex like you
Let's face it, I can’t replace it
That's why all I want is you now

[Verse 5: J. Cole]
I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal
Tryin' to celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl who I’m kidding?
Still sick, real shit
All my new hoes seem to get old real quick
And could it be, you everything that these plain bitches couldn’t be?
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn’t be
Lost in the Player way, sorta get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl you got a hold on me
I say I’m wrong, You say come again
Damn said I was wrong look don’t rub it in
I got a lot on my mind
Got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of hoes
How they coming in
Just saying
Don’t wanna have me then somebody will
I’m playing
Weight on my chest like I body build
I’m praying
You ain’t content with tryin' to do your thang
And come back baby boomerang

[Hook: Miguel]
All I want is you
All I want is you now
All I want is you now
Now that you’re gone, gone, gone
