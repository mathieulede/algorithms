[Estelle]
Cause I just wanna love you baby
I don't wanna waste no time
I wanna be your only one baby please don't break my heart

[Intro - Rick Ross]
I rose from the dead tailor made black linen
Tinted Escalade with a made man in it
Rose gold shades with the rose lenses
Pink champagne and the flow's so endless (uhhUHH)
All I seek is perfection
Ain't no secret I'mma eat that for breakfast
Keep her close to me
Like lyrics she spoke to me
In the middle of the winter, summer let her close to me

[Verse 1 - Estelle]
All these stars out
And these people know my name
I can be so pretentious
But he likes me all the same
And these lights are glowing
But he don't want none
He'd rather chill at home
Maybe he can be the one

[Bridge - Estelle]
You want me to trust you but how can I trust you
When I don't know the first thing about that
There's so many questions and so many lessons
Messin' with my heart and I just got it back

I just wanna love you baby
I don't wanna waste no time
I wanna be your only one
Baby please don't break my heart

[Verse 2 - Estelle]
I been here before
I don't know if you're the type
Who's gonna keep me sure
When the doubt creeps in my mind
Will you be there baby?
Or will you let me go?
Can you stand the pressure?
This is what I need to know

[Bridge - Estelle]
You want me to trust you but how can I trust you
When I don't know the first thing about that
There's so many questions and so many lessons
And I need for you to have my back

Cause I just wanna love you baby
I don't wanna waste no time
I wanna be your only one
Baby please don't break my heart

[Verse - Rick Ross]
All white in the winter, green in the summer
Painted the Lamborghini same color marijuana
Floatin' in the 6 'til I made her seasick
Wettin' these hoes up with this AMG kit
Earned a reputation ripping up and down the boulevard
Me and baby Bonnie and Clyde up in them rental cars
Propositions from politicians are common now
My money tall we could never be on common ground
Peel the top back gettin' higher than the higher power
Makin' love in the penthouse then it's sayonara
Fell in love with shorty blame it on the chemistry
Tools on the low, foes really envy me
Money multiplied S600 Benz
Me and my shorty live we a team 'til the end
Monopoly shopping sprees imagine what we can spend
Me and my shorty live we'll do this shit again

[Estelle]
Don't break it, please don't break my heart
No don't break it, please don't baby
I just wanna love you baby
I knew it from the very start
I wanna be your only one
Baby please don't break my heart

You got me living on a prayer
You can be a millionaire or broke we won't pretend
You know you're more than a friend
Just because you love me I'mma love you 'til the end
I got you, and you got me
I like you, and you like me
And we can do everything
I wanna love you oh baby baby baby

Don't break it, please don't break my heart
No don't break it, please don't baby
Cause I just wanna love you baby
I don't wanna waste no time
I wanna be your only one
Baby please don't break my heart
Please don't baby
I just wanna love you baby...
