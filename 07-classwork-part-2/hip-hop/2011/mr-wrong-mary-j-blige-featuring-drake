[Drake - Verse 1]
Don’t it seem like
Like I’m always there when it matters
But missing most of the other time
A terrible pattern
The rewards I see from working
Made me an addict
There's way more people that want it
Than people that have it
I don't get it, I would hate to think I tricked ‘em
They fall victim to my system
Guess I sure know how to pick em
And I’m always her regret
Yeah, I’m always her regret
And I always make it harder on whoever’s coming next
It goes up and down, it’s just up and down
She’s crying now but she’ll laugh again
Cause we on the rise and she here with us
And expensive shit, just keeps happening
She loves it, she stares at me like who does this
And we hold hands while I pray that she’s not the type to hold grudges
I’m wrong..

[Mary J Blige - Verse 1]
Bad boys ain't no good
Good boys ain't no fun
Lord knows that I should
Run off with the right one

[Mary J Blige - Chorus]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Mary J Blige - Verse 2]
Hung up off your good
You call and I run
My fam' is screaming at me don’t do it
"Don't do it, Mary!"
I guess they never had none

[Mary J Blige - Chorus]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on(going on)
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Mary J Blige - Bridge]
When he put that loving on me, I can’t think of nothing
That’ll make me walk out
I’m holding on
I love my Mr. Wrong
He be kissing and touching on me
I can’t help but love him
I must be out my mind
For going so strong
I love my Mr. Wrong
Mr. Wrong

[Mary J Blige - Chorus]
Me and Mr. Wrong get along so good (so good)
Even though he breaks my heart so bad (so bad)
We got a special thing going on(going on)
Me and Mr. Wrong (Mr. Wrong)
Even if I try, no, I never could (I never could)
Give him up cause his loves like that
Ain't no way that I’m moving on
I love my Mr. Wrong

[Outro - Mary J. Blige]
Mr. Wrong
