You said when the storm came
That you would be there with your umbrella to block the rain
And you said you'd protect me from heartache
Pain, lies, loneliness, and misery
You said you'll tear down the walls
That were in the way
You promise things would be okay
And I stood there in the freezing cold
And I waited for you but you never showed

Where you at [3x]
Boy you said you would be there for me
Where you at [6x]

Now you said you'll go to church stop slanging find a real job
And go to work and you said you would stay out the streets spend time with me take away my doubt and fears
And fulfill my dreams you said you would be the shoulder for my eyes to cry on
You said depend on and I stood there in the freezing cold and i waited for ya but you never showed

Where you at [5x]
Boy you said you'd be there for me
Where you at

And those false promises is much like fake names
You painted a picture for me but there was no frame
You made my future look bright and I believed every word
I went to sleep on the cloud and woke up in the dirt
And now I'm without shelter and the wind is blowing
You said you would be there for me boy when the tough got going
Said if weapons formed stand in front of me
When ever I felt trapped you said that you
Would be the one to set me free
Thought you were my hero but as it turned out you were no show

Tell me where you at
You said you would be there for me
Where you at [3x]
And I can't see, see, see, see
You said you'd be right there for me
So I'm waiting on ya right here until you appear and
Deliver[3x] deliver boy deliver[3x]
