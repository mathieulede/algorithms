Let me do you all night long
Hey, wanna do it all night long (baby)

[Verse 1]
Hop up out the bed
Take a shower then get dressed
Gotta go to work but I wanna lay with you instead, baby
Softly kiss you there, make you say Oooh yeah
I’ll be coming back to you boy you just tell me when, ooh baby

[Hook]
Gonna be a late night, early morning when I get you home
Gonna give you good love, give you what you want and
Gonna do it all night long
Baby, let me do you all night long
Let me do it all night long

[Verse 2]
The day is almost through
All that I can think about is you
The hair I done sweated out
Scream your name, let it out
You are everything but the truth
Shivers down my spine when I think about the freaky things I got in mind
So I’ll be on my way to give it to you baby
Let me take my time

[Hook]
It’s gonna be a late night til the early morning when I come on home
It’s gonna be that good love, give you what you want and
I’m gonna do it all night long
Wanna do it all night long
We can do it all night long
Baby, Let me do you all night long (x5)
Good love, give you what you want and we can do it all night long
Let me do it all night long
