People just don't know what I'm about...
They haven't seen what's there behind my smile...
There's so much more of me I'm showin out...
(These are the pieces of me)

When it looks like I'm up... sometimes I'm down
I'm alone even when people all around, but that don't change the happiness I found...
(These are the pieces of me)

So when you look at my face... You gotta know that I'm made... of everything love and pain. (These are the pieces of me)

Like every woman I know... I'm complicated fo sho... But when I love I love til there's no love no mo. (These are the pieces of me)

So many colors... (I make up the woman that you see)
A good friend and lover (Anything you want Yes I can be)
I can run the business and make time for fantasy (These are the pieces of me)

Now I'm gonna make mistakes from time to time...But in the end believe that I'm gone fly. No matter if I'm wrong or if I'm right. (These are the pieces of me)

So when you look at my face... You gotta know that I'm made... of everything love and pain. (These are the pieces of me)

Like every woman I know... I'm complicated fo sho... But when I love I love til there's no love no mo. (These are the pieces of me)

Ohhhh As the pieces of me start to unfold...Now I start to understand....All that I am.. A woman Not afraid to be strong STRONG...

So when you look at my face... You gotta know that I'm made... of everything love and pain. (These are the pieces of me)

Like every woman I know... I'm complicated fo sho... But when I love I love til there's no love no mo. (These are the pieces of me)
