Aha! Hmmm! Hmm
I, I, I, I've been through some things
Please don't hold that against me
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Even though I, I, I still can feel a sting
No need to second guess me
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you

See I, I, I, I, I don't mind you
Putting up a little bit of fight, it's alright
But why run from what's gonna hold you tight
Through any complications, baby, maybe we can start tonight!

Hey! I saw the dirty look you gave me
Don't care what your ex do
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you!
Ain't no one gonna love you, like I'm gonna love you!
And if you dare, don't dare
Send me straight to voice mail
Baby I'm just gonna text you
Hope it ain't no issue, I just gotta let you
Know no one to love you like I'm gonna love you!

See I, I, I, I, I don't mind you
Putting up a little bit of fight, it's alright
But why run from what's gonna hold you tight
Through any complications, baby, maybe we can start tonight!

Oh, oh, oh!
I put that on everything!
Ain't no one gonna love you!
Ain't no one gonna hold you!
Show you what I could show you!
Somebody better told you!
Oh, oh, oh!
Baby, your name's spelled out in every heartbeat!
Ain't no one gonna love you!
Ain't no one gonna hold you!
Show you what I could show you!

But if you should go down that same road
You've been before
You're in reverse, your pain rehearsed,just brace yourself for the blow
But don't you know that you could just let it go?
Don't you know

I, I, I, I've been through some things
Please don't hold that against me
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Don't you know I, I, I, I, I'm making you this promise
Clutchin' on a rosary
Ain't no one gonna love you, like I'm gonna love you!
Ain't no one gonna love you, like I'm gonna love you!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

I put that on everything
Ain't no one gonna love you
Ain't no one gonna hold you
Show you what I could show you!
Somebody better tell you!
Oh, Oh, Oh!

I, I, I, I've been through some things
Please don't hold that against me
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Can't nobody love you like I'm gonna love you
Don't you know I, I, I, I, I'm making you this promise
Clutchin' on a rosary
Ain't no one gonna love you, like I'm gonna love you!
Ain't no one gonna love you, like I'm gonna love you!
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
