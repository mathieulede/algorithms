[Intro]
I used to think about immature things
You know like, do you love me? Do you want me?
Are you gonna call me like you said you would?
Is this really your real phone number?
But you know I'm a man now, baby, a grown man
And I came a long way, he-he
And experience taught me one thing
Taught me to hold on to my love

[Verse 1]
Sometimes
I just can't help thinkin' livin' without you, baby
See, sometimes, I just can't live cryin' about you, baby

I'm not worried 'bout a doggone thing
I'll take anything you bring
Although I love the sunshine
I'll still accept rain
Cause when I'm in my lonely mood
And I just can't be with you
I tried everything to occupy my mind
And there was no substitute

Thinking all that life would be
When you're not around
I just could not find my way
I wouldn't even know up from down
But since I've had you in my life
All thing can be found
So strong and true, baby
All comin' from you

[Chorus]
You, I call your name, girl (Whenever I am lonely, baby)
I call your name (When I feel the need of love)
I think of you, and it eases the pain
Take away the strain

[Verse 2]
Cause I don't worry what my people say
In my life today
Although they try to say you're not the one for me
I'll love you anyway
Cause their intentions might be cool
If what they say was true
But there's more to you than they could ever see
And they don't even know you

Thinking all that life would be
When you're not around
I just could not find a way
I wouldn't even know up from down
But since I've had you in my life
All things can be found
So strong and true, baby
Comin' from you, you, you, you, you

[Chorus]
You, I call your name, girl (Sometimes when I get lonely, baby)
I call your name (When I feel the need of love)
I think of you and it eases the pain
Take away the strain

You, I call your name, girl (Sometimes I get lonely, baby)
I call your name
(I just can't seem to help myself for not wanting to be alone)
I think of you and it eases the pain
(So I call your name, I call your name)
Take away the strain

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I do, you do
Birds and bees do too
I love you, you love me
And I know
Whoa oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
I call your name and it eases the pain

See, I just don't feel all by myself tonight
It seems like someone else is out there
Oh, thinkin' of holding someone else tight
So you will know where I'm comin' from
Oh, when I'm lonely, when I'm discouraged
Oh, I call your name, baby

There is no substitute for you
No one could take your place
You're more than they can ever receive
That's why I call your name

Oh, baby, when I am lonely
When I am discouraged
I call your name, girl
I think of you and it eases the pain
Take away the strain

[Chorus]
You, I call your name, girl (Sometimes when I get lonely, baby)
I call your name (When I feel the need of love)
I think of you and it eases the pain
Take away the strain

Da da di la la la la la la
Da da di la da di da la la la la (I call your name)
Da da di la da di la la la la la
Da da di la da di da di da di da (I call your name, girl)

Da da di la da di da la la la la
Da da da la da di da la la la la (I think of you and it eases the pain)
Da da la da di da la da la da (Take away the strain)
Da da la da di da la da la da

I call you, it's you, baby (I call your name)
And you, baby, and you, whoa oh (I call your name, girl)
You you you you you you you you you you you
(I think of you and it eases the pain)
I call your name (Take away the strain)

[Bridge]
I do, you do
Birds and bees do too
I love you, you love me
And I know
Whoa oh whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
I call your name and it eases the pain

I call your name
