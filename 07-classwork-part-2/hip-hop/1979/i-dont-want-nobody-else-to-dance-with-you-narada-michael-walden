I don't want nobody else
To mess with you
I don't want nobody else
To dance with you

You think you're cute just
'Cause you dance with my bro
But you ain't seen nothin'
Baby, I'm gonna get my dancing shoes

'Cause I'm crazy about ya
Got that sparkle in your eyes
And I need your sweet reaction
Just a little bit more

I don't want nobody else
To dance with you
I don't want nobody else
To dance with you

Baby, come real quick
I got some blues to share with you
Oh, I know I've gone shiftless
I'm in a bit of a mess for you

See I'm crazy about you
You got that magic in your eyes
And I need for you to show me
Just a little bit more

I don't want nobody but you
To dance with me say it

I don't want nobody but you
To dance with me say it

I don't want nobody but you
To dance with me say it

I don't want nobody but you
To dance with me say it

See I'm crazy about you
You got that sparkle in your eyes
And I need for you to give me
Just a little bit more

I don't want nobody else
To dance with you
I don't want nobody else
To dance with you
Say it

I don't want nobody else
To dance with you
I don't want nobody else
To dance with you
Say it

I don't want nobody else
