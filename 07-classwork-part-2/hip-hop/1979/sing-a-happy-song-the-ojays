Sing a happy song, sing a happy song
Why don't you sing along, sing a happy song?
Get on up and dance, sing a happy song
Come on, clap your hands, sing a happy song

Music's good for your soul
It can bring a real good feelin'
Good for the young and old
Brighten up the darkest day, oh!

It can be your release
It can supply you with peace
Some peace of mind
Why don't you

Sing a happy song, sing a happy song? (sing)
Come on, sing along, sing a happy song (why don't you?)
Why don't you dance awhile, sing a happy song? (dance, dance)
Come on, get involved, sing a happy song

Can't you feel, feel the beat?
Go ahead and pat your feet and
Let the rhythm take control
Move your body from side to side, oh

If you are feelin' down
Tune right into the sound
The sound of music
Why don't you

Sing a happy song, sing a happy song? (come on, chase all away)
Chase all your blues away, sing a happy song (hey, now!)
Get on up and dance, sing a happy song (y'all, y'all, y'all)
Come on, clap your hands, sing a happy song

You know, you can do it
It's easy, so easy to do
Sing it loud and hearty
Come on everybody, let's get down and party (sing)

Sing a happy song, sing a happy song (sing)
Come on, sing along, sing a happy song (you want that)
Get on up and dance, sing a happy song (dance, dance, dance)
Come on, clap your hands, sing a happy song

You know, you can do it
It's easy, so easy to do
Sing it loud and hearty
Come on everybody, let's get down and party (sing)

Sing a happy song, sing a happy song (sing, sing, sing)
Come on, sing along, sing a happy song
Why don't you dance awhile, sing a happy song?
Come on get involved, sing a happy song

Sing a happy song, sing a happy song
Chase all your blues away, sing a happy song
Get on up and dance, sing a happy song
Come on clap your hands, sing a happy song

Music, make your life
And make your soul happy
Sing a happy song
Music, music, music, music
Music, music, music, music, happy music


Well, y'all sing a happy song, sing a happy song
Why don't you sing along, sing a happy song?
Get on up and dance, sing a happy song
Come on clap your hands, sing a happy song

Sing a happy song, sing a happy song
Come on, sing along, sing a happy song
Why don't you dance awhile, sing a happy song?
Come on get involved, sing a happy song

Music can make you happy, make you so happy
