High stepper, hip dresser
High stepper, hip dresser

High steppin', hip dressin' fella
You got it together
High steppin', hip dressin' fella
You got it together

There's a guy in the neighborhood
And, oh Lord, if I could
I'd wrap him up and take him home

His machine is always clean
Whenever he's on the scene
And there's always a crowd around

Girls watch him like a hawk
Watchin' his body talk
Oh Lord, they love for him to get down, ooh

Oh, if I could find a way to tell him
I'm what he really needs
Oh, but they say you're not a lady

If you feel that you really need
Someone who makes you feel like, ooh
I don't know what I should do

He's a high steppin', hip dressin' fella

You got it together
High steppin', hip dressin' fella
You got it together

Always so polite
He never seems uptight
He's the kind of a man a woman wants around

Hair cut close and neat
Deck down to his foot
And he's always 3-piece down

I've got to find a way to tell him
I'm really all he needs
They say you've got to be a lady

You've got to play along
You can't come on strong
I don't care if it's wrong
I just want to get it on

High steppin', hip dressin' fella
You got it together
High steppin', hip dressin' fella
You got it together
