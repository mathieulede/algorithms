At first, I was afraid, I was petrified
Thinking, I couldn't live without you by my side
Hm after spending nights thinking, "how you did me wrong?"
I grew strong and I learned how to get along

Now you're back from outer space
And I find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
Or made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got my life to live, and all my love to give
And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive

It took all my strength not to fall apart
Trying with all my mind to mend  my broken heart
I spent,  so many nights feeling sorry for myself
Oh, I cried but now I hold my head up high

And you see me, somebody new
Not that lonely little person still in love with you
Now you come dropping in  expecting me to be free
Now I'm saving all my loving for someone who's loving me

Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got  my life to live, and all my love to give
And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive
Go on go, walk out the door, turn around now
You're not welcome anymore
You're the one, who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

Oh, no, not I, I will survive
Long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got  my life to live, and all my love to give
And I'll survive, I, I , I will survive
