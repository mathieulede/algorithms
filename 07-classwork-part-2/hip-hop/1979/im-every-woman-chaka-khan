I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z
I can cast a spell
So that you can't tell
Mix a special brew
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel, danger or fear
Then instantly I will appear, 'cause
I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
I can sense your needs, like rain on to the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
Then I got it, I got it
I got it, got it, got it baby
I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z
I ain't braggin' 'cause I'm the one
You just ask me ooh and it shall be done
And don't bother to compare
I've got it
I've got it, I've got it, yeah
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
I'm every woman
