[Chorus:]
I belong to You
I belong to You
I belong to You
(Yours all alone)
Ooh, oh
(Mind, body, and soul)
(why don't You take me)
(make me what You want me to be)
I belong to You
I belong to You
I belong to You
(I'm Yours all alone)
Ooh, oh
(Mind, body, and soul)
(why don't You take me)

[Verse 1:]
You see, You saved
My soul from a burning hell
And right now, I'm so glad I can tell...

[Chorus 2:]
I belong to You
I belong to You
I belong to You
(I'm Yours all alone)

[Verse 2:]
You're the Spirit
That lets me sleep at night
Then I wake up early in the morning
Knowing everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus 2]
[Ending:]
I belong to You
I belong to You
I belong to You
