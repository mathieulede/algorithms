If you see me walkin'
Down the street
And I start to cry
Each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by
Make believe that
You don't see the tears I
Just let me grieve in private
'cause each time I see you
I break down and cry

Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by

I just can't get over losin' you
And so if I seem broken and blue
Walk on by, walk on by
Foolish pride
That's all that I have left
So let me hide the tears and
The sadness you gave me
When you said good-bye

Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on by
