Her name is Sophelia
And she is my fly

And that's no lie

A real poppin' lady, yeah
So soft and so pretty
And when I get around her, yeah

And her smile is so fine
(So fine, so fine, so fine)

Instant love potion, yeah
Just oozed through my mind

She two steps so fine
She's such a lovely lady, lady, lady
I'm so glad she's mine, oh, mama sita
