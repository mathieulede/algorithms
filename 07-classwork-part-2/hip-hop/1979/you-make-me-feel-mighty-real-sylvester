[Verse 1]
When we're out there dancin' on the floor darlin'
And I feel like I need some more
And I feel your body close to mine
And I move on love, it's about that time
Make me feel,  mighty real
Make me feel, mighty real

[Hook]
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

[Verse 2]
When we get home darlin'
And it's nice and dark
And the music's in Vienna
Still your hot and you kiss me back and it
Feels real good and I know you love me
Like you should

[Hook]
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real

Make me feel, mighty real
Make me feel, mighty real
Make me feel, mighty real
Make me feel, mighty real

[Chorus]
I feel real
I feel real
I feel real
I feel real

I feel real
I feel real
I feel real
I feel real
Huh

I feel real
I feel real
I feel real
I feel real

Huh I feel real
Huh I feel real
I feel real
I feel real
I feel real
I feel real

[Hook]
You make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
Oh you make me feel mighty real
You make me feel mighty real
