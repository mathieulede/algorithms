Been a long time
Since you touched me
And made me feel that wonderful glow
The way you do
Been a long time
Since you held me and squeezed me
So I wonder what's come over you

I don't know if I ought to bring it up
Seems like such a funny thing to talk about
Don't know if it's right to do
Nowhere to turn to
Ooh, I'm up against the wall

And I wanna know (Oh)

Is it still good to ya
Does it feel alright (Oh...oh...)
Is it still good to ya
Will you prove it tonight
(Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...)

Been a long time
Since you asked me how was my day
And kissed me before I could say
It's been a long time
Since you told me
If things could change
You wouldn't have it no other way

And I don't know if I ought to bring it up
It seems like such a funny thing to talk about
I don't know if it's right to do
But I don't wanna bug you
And ooh, I'm up against the wall

And I wanna know (Give it to me straight now)
I wanna know (No need to hesitate)
I wanna know, know (Oh) (Oh)

Is it still good to ya
Does it feel (Does it feel) alright (Does it feel) (Does it feel alright) (Oh...)
Is it still good to ya (To you)
Will you prove it tonight (Prove it to me, yeah) (Oh...) (Oh..)

Is it still good to ya, is it good
Is it still good to ya (Ooh, ooh), is it good (Yeah, yeah)
Is it still good to ya (Ah...), is it good
Is it still good to ya, is it good
