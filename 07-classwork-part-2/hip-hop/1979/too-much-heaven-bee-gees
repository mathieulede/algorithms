[Hook:  Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Oh you and me girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
Then my life, I can see beyond forever
Everything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?

[Hook: Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
You and me girl got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears you had to cry
You're my life
I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we are will never die
Loving's such a beautiful thing
When you are to me, the light above
Made for all to see our precious love

[Hook: Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

[Interlude]
Love is such a beautiful thing
You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

[Hook] [x2] [Barry (with falsetto), Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by
I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain
And harder to climb
