Don't be afraid to say you need me
Don't let your pride keep us apart
Because I can make you so happy
You can make me happy too

Cause it's all right, all right cause it's you and me
Yes it's all right, all right cause it's you and me together
All right with me
And it's all right with me

Can we love if I can't touch you
Don't be afraid it's only me
Because I can make you so happy
If you only let me in, only let me into your heart

Cause it's all right, alright cause it's you and me
Yes it's all right, all right cause it's you and me together
All right with me
All right with me

I can make you so happy
If you only let me in, only let me into your heart

Cause it's all right, alright cause it's you and me
Yes it's all right, all right cause it's you and me together
All right with me
All right with me
All right with me
All right with me
All right with me
