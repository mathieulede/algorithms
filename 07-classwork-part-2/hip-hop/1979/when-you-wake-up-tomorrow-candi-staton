When you wake up tomorrow
Will you forget the things you said tonight?
Or will I be just another girl
In your revolving world?

When you wake up tomorrow
Will you say to me all the things I love to hear?
Will you answer to my call
For more love after all is said and done?

Let’s keep the fire burning, let’s keep the fire burning
Let’s enjoy what we have tonight
Emotions running wild, sharing laughter like a child
Let’s use the time it takes to find us
Take my will, make time stand still
Let’s make the world revolve around us

When you wake up tomorrow will I look the same
As when you had the look of love in your eyes?
Or will it seem like a misty scene
Love fading in a dream?

When you wake up tomorrow
Will you remember the things you said tonight?
Were those words spoken just in vain
Can we relive those moments without pain?

I know when you’re gone the memory lingers on
I won’t forget that love found us
Let’s hold each other tight, cherish what we have tonight
And maybe someday love might find us
Love me good, it’s understood we won’t cling to each other
