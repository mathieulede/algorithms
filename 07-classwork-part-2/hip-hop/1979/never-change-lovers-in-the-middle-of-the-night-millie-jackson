[Intro 1]
You and I were finished
I was through with you
Splitting up forever
Seemed the thing to do
I said I can't stand you
With your honey touch
This time you were cheating me
One time too much

[Intro 2]
Just then I remembered
That a friend I knew
Told me one thing
I should never do

[Chorus 1]
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night
Everything may look so different in the early morning light
Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark
What you're getting into may be a lark
Just keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high
Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why
Let the heat wear off a little, give your man another chance
Don't fall for someone else's song and dance

[Verse 1]
Sure there was this guy right next to me
Mine just for the asking he said he would be
But to me my man seemed to me all too strange
And I'd say that I'm glad I did not make the change
Now our life is almost like a Paradise
Let me pass on to you this advice

[Chorus 2]
Keep your cool and don't change lovers in the middle of the night
You may feel a strong temptation, the vibrations may be right
But who knows what's gonna happen, you may simply lose your cool
When you find it, you'll find out you were a fool
So never never change your lovers under any midnight spell
Take it easy, slow and easy, everything will turn out well
Let the sun shine on a new day, and don't move while you're uptight
Changing lovers in the middle of the night
Ow!

[Chorus 1]
