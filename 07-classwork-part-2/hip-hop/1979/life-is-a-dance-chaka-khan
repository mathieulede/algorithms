[Hook]
Life is a dance, life is a dance
Life is a dance, life is a dance

[Verse 1]
Everywhere coast to coast, around the land
We all have one thing in common: we all love to dance
In and out of discos, crazy lights
Keep on moving all through the night

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Why don't you listen, listen to the groove
I am sure enough sure you'll find
Just the rhythm, the rhythm of your soul
Dance to the music keeping steady time

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Dance to the music, crazy lights
Dance to the music on crazy lights
Dance to the music, crazy lights
Dance

[Hook]
