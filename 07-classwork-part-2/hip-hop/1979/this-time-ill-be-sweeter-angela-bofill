[Verse 1:]
Darling, can't you see
What losing you has done to me
I'm not the same girl
I used to be

Have a change of heart
Don't leave me standing in the dark
Don't let confusion keep us apart

Come back to me
And i'll guarantee
All the tenderness
And love you'll ever need

[Chorus:]
This time i'll be sweeter
Our love will run deeper
I won't mess around
I won't let you let down
Have faith in me
Have faith in me

[Verse 2:]
Since you've been away
I haven't seen the light of day
I'm lost without you
Can't find my way

So won't you please be fair
And let me show how much I care
Say you'll be mine and answer my prayer

Come back to me
And I promise I'll be
Everything's that bright and new
Your whole life through

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
