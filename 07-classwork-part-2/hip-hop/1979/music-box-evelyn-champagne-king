My music
My music

It's a funky situation
I keep telling myself
When I'm digging on my radio
Can't think of nothing else

The beat really turns me on
Why can't I last a little longer?
Ooh, how it's killing me
I can't turn it off

It's a feeling in my heart
Tearing me all apart
If I can't depend on my radio
Then I got no place to go

I play my music box
It really makes me shout
My music box
It really knocks me out

Just a little bit of guitar
And a whole lot of bass
Add a bit of funky jumps, now
I'm really out in space

I don't have to do the town
Ohh, when I feel a little down
Ooh, how my head spins
When I'm feeling the beat

I'm so in love with my radio
From my hands and my feet
It's a strange kind of feeling
You know
You know
You got me rocking and a-reeling

My music box
It really makes me shout
My music box
It really knocks me out

I can feel the rhythm
You on my mind
And when it comes to this
I can't resist
To let myself unwind

As long as there's music
On my radio
I'm gonna get out my seat
Stomp my feet
And oooh, just let go

My music box
It really makes me shout
My music box
It really knocks me out

Music box
Makes me shout
Music box
Knocks me out

Get out your seat
Stomp your feet
And feel the rhythm to the beat
