You gonna make me love somebody else
If you keep on treating me the way you do
You gonna make me love somebody else
If you keep on treating me the way you do

I ain't did nothing to you
I just love you with my heart, heart and soul
Everytime I need some lovin
Why do you turn, turn cold
Now I ain't dumb, and I ain't stupid
I know you need love, need love like I do
Cause if you ain't loving me
I wanna know who in the world you loving
Tell me if you don't want me around

You gonna make me love somebody else
If you keep on treating me the way you do
I don't wanna do it

You gonna make me love somebody else
If you keep on treating me the way you do

I don't say nothing to you
When you stay out, stay out all night long
I know you got to make money
But bring your loving home, bring it home
Now what's out there in the street
That's taking up, taking up all of your time
Cause if you ain't loving me
I wanna know who in the world you loving
Tell me if you don't want me around

You gonna make me love somebody else
If you keep on treating me the way you do
I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna do it

You gonna make me love somebody else
If you keep on treating me the way you do

You gonna make me love somebody
You gonna make me love somebody
I need love just like you do
Tell me who you been giving it to
I'm gon love somebody

You gonna make me love somebody
You gonna make me love somebody

Repeat Chorus
