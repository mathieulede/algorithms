Aaah

[Verse 1:]
You set my lips on fire
You won the key to my heart
You've got a special way to move me
Can't stop now
Let's do it again

You keep me dancing through the moonlight
I feel the pleasure in your touch
And everything you are is heaven
Oh I can't get enough
No, I can't get enough

[Chorus:]
Instant replay
Got to have it
Instant replay
Ooh, whoa, ooh-ooh
Instant replay
Got to have your love again

[Verse 2:]
I feel so good about us
I found a shining star
And when I look into your eyes
It's magic

Well, I just know this can't be a dream
I'm so happy must be real
In every way its getting stronger
Now you know it
Let me show it

[Chorus:]
Instant replay
Oh, got to have it now
Instant replay
Woo, woo, woo, ooh
Instant replay
Got me floating on a cloud
Got me dancing all around
All around
All around

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Eeya, eeya, eeya, eeya, eeya
Doo
Doo, doo-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ah, ah, ah

[Chorus:]
Instant replay
Instant replay

Instant replay
Instant replay
Instant replay
Woo, ooh, ooh, ah

I can't stand it
I can't stand it
Got to have it
Cause I need it

Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?

I need your love
Ooh, ooh, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby
I say it one more more time

You know I need love
I need love, love
Love, love
You know I need love
