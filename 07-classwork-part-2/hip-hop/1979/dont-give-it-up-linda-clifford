Alright, girls, here we go again
We gon' have to get together
And figure out what we gon' do with all these men
You know how they can be, don't you?

Oh, yeah, they sit back and they take all them good years away
Take everything they can get and then when you hit 25, talk about
"Oh, you done got too old for me
I'mma have to go out and find me somebody about 18"

They ain't playin'
See, you laugh it off if you want to
But they serious as a heart attack
You know what I mean

So, what we gotta do is get our heads together
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
And figure out how we gon' change things around a little bit
You know what I mean

We got to work on this from morning 'til night
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
(Look out)
'Cause, as long as you let them get away with it, they gon' do it
(Look out)
They'll do it every time

Now, take for instance
When a dude drives up, see, in this big, fine car
Starts tellin' you, "How fine you are, oh, baby, you fine"
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)

Yeah, and then he gon' try to get you inside that car, talkin' 'bout
"I'm gonna make you a star, baby"
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
Beware, sister, you got to look out for that

Then there's always the type that's gon' come over
And bring you diamonds and furs and all this stuff
(Look out)
I tell you what, girls, I want you to take 'em
That's right

'Cause you gotta keep what you got while you're hot
And don't give nothin' up to nobody
And no matter what they say, you got to tell 'em right away
That you ain't givin' nothin' up to nobody, no how

When you're hot, you're hot
(That's right, girls, don't give nothin' away)
When you're not, you're not
When you're hot, you're hot
When you're not, you're not

Temptation is such
(Temptation)
It won't get you half as much
(Temptation)
As you get when your man is good to you
(Temptation)

And as long as he makes you feel
That his love is really real
Then, baby, here's what you got to do

You gotta dig the situation
Have a good relation
Show appreciation but without hesitation

You got to let him know
That he's gonna have to go
If he ever starts messin' 'round on you
(No, no, no, no)

And you gotta keep what you got while you're hot
And don't give nothin' up to nobody
Hey, and no matter what they say, you got to tell 'em right away
I ain't givin' nothin' up to nobody, no how

(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
I ain't givin' nothin' up
You ain't gettin' nothin' yet, junior
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
That's right

Now listen
Now, I'm gonna hold on to my man just as long as I can hold him
(Just hold on, just hold on)
See, but I ain't gonna take no stuff 'cause like I told you, I've had enough
(Just hold on)

And, even though my love is strong
I ain't gonna let him do me wrong
And, if he acts like he wants to go
I'm gonna walk him right out the door

And I'm gonna keep what I got while I'm hot
I ain't givin' nothin' up to nobody
(When you're hot, you're hot)
(When you're not, you're not)
Hey, and no matter what they say, I'll tell them right away
I ain't givin' nothin' up to nobody, no how

(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
No, I ain't givin' nothin' away
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
I'm gon' keep everything I've got, that's right
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)

Hit the music, you dawg
[Incomprehensible]
Ooh, feels good

I, I'm gon' keep what I got while I'm hot
(Look out)
And ain't gon' give it up to nobody
And no matter what they say, I'll tell them right away
I ain't givin' nothin' up to nobody, no how
I ain't givin' nothin' up, no

(Beware)
Not now, not next week, the next year or in the hereafter
(Look out)
What you gotto give me
See that's what I want to hear about
That's right

(Beware)
See the whole trick is we should all be walkin' around here
In diamonds and furs and drivin' 'em big fine cars
(Look out)
But they ain't gonna do that

You young girls out there, you better watch your step
Because they lookin' for you, honey
They after you like white on rice
That's right, don't give 'em a chance

You give 'em an inch, they gon' take a whole mile
You heard that sayin' before?
(Look out)
Well, it's the truth

Yeah, look, oh, oh, oh, oh
Look here comes one now
(Look out)
Look at, look at this car, hon
Look at this car here

Oh, oh, he's slowin' down too
(Beware)
Alright, girl, he's after you
(Look out)
Yes, indeed, drivin' a Mercedes, got 'em a poodle in the backseat
Now you know you don't need no dog, don't you?

(Beware)
Alright, he gon' talk to you now, don't you get in that car
Now listen
(Look out)
I told you what he was gon' say to you, didn't I?

Yeah, they don't change the line too much
It's the same old thing, yeah
Don't you get in there
You've gotto get yours first, honey
That's the way it's gon' be from now on

Give me, give me, give me
That's right, whoo
Keep it, don't turn it loose for nothin'
They all after it
That's right
That's right

I'm gon' keep what I got while I'm hot
And ain't gon' give it up to nobody
(When you're hot, you're hot)
(When you're not, you're not)
And no matter come what may, I'm gon' tell them right away
I ain't givin' nothin' up to nobody, no how

(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
I wanna see what you gon' give me before I give up anything
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)
And if it ain't right, you know what they say
(Beware, sister, sister, you better beware)

You slow, you blow, you snooze, you lose
Well, you done lost out, ha?
(Look out)
I wanna see somethin' that's gon' hold my attention
You know what I mean?
(Look out)

Yo, what color's your money?
Always I like the green, that's what I wanna see, green
For days, show me your bank book
With a lot of zeroes after the first five numbers and I'm happy

See now, I don't wanna see no Washingtons and no Lincolns
Show me some Grants
Show me some, some Hamiltons, you know what I mean?
(Look out)
I want some blue chips
And I ain't talkin' 'bout some food stamps neither, honey

I want some stocks and bonds
(Look out)
All of 'em in my name, that's right
(Look out)

I want all I can get before you get anything
I ain't givin' up a thing till you show me
The proof is in the puddin', honey, that's what they say
You gotto prove it to me

I'm gon' keep what I got
'Cause you know like they say
When you're hot, you're hot
And when you're not, you're just not, yeah

I know I'm hot, he, he, yeah
Gon' be hot too for a long time too
As long as I can get to mess around with fools like you

I told you to get that dog outta here, didn't I?
No, no, no, he ain't gonna come in here pleadin' your case
Get your dog out

Don't come here doodin' up my room
