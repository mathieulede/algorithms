I don't know if it's right
To let you make love to me tonight
I don't know if I should
Give my love to you when I know you're no good

I've got to make sure it's alright
If I should let you love me tonight
Before I let you kiss me I got to get the situation in hand
'Cause I don't want you just to be another man, whoa, whoa, whoa

I don't know if it's right
To let you make love to me tonight
I don't know if I should
Give my love to you when I know you're no good

People tell me that you really know the right things to say
Especially when you're tryin' to get your way
Gotta be careful, gotta be smart, gotta watch out for my heart
I don't want it to be broken right from the start, oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know if it's right
To let you make love to me tonight
I don't know if I should
Give my love to you when I know you're no good

Oh, baby
Yeah...hey...hey...
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I don't know if it's right
To let you make love to me tonight
I don't know if I should
Give my love to you when I know you're no good

I don't know if I should
Give it to you when I know you're no good
If it's right
I just don't know, no, hey..hey...
