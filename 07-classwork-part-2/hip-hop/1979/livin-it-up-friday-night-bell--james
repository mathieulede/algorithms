Up in the morning at six o'clock
Head for the city
Turn on the music, the radio
Nobody's hurrying

Day after day
Slaving away, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Punching the time
I'm late again
Sneak in the back way

I count the hours, minutes too
So glad it's Friday

Jump in my ride
It's Friday night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Livin' it up, livin' it up
Oh, yeah, Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Living it up, livin' it up
Oh, yeah, Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last

Only on a Friday
Never on a Sunday
Never on a Monday

Same situation every day
Some kind of voodoo
Same complications
Stand in the way
Nowhere to run to

My mind is dreaming
I'm somewhere else
Can't seem to shake it
I miss the feeling
Having fun
No way to fake it

Jump in my ride
It's Friday night
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Livin' it up, livin' it up
Oh, yeah, Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Living it up, livin' it up
Oh, yeah, Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last

Living it up
Living it up, oh, yeah
Living it up
Living it up at last

Living it up
Living it up, oh, yeah
Living it up
Living it up at last

Livin' it up, livin' it up
Oh, yeah, Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last
Living it up, livin' it up
Oh, yeah, Friday night
Livin' it up, livin' it up at last

Living it up, living it up
Oh, yeah, Friday night
