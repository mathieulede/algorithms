[Verse 1]
Here I am - There you are
We've been sitting here for so long
You and I, catching each other's eyes
And wondering if we should give it all

Should I just walk away (walk away)
With nothing to say (nothing to say)
Or take a chance on both hands
Oh girl, tell me where do we go from here
Yeah...

Here we are, all alone
Finally got together to see (just to see)
If you and I can share a love affair
To find out if we were meant to be

Should I just turn my head (turn my head)
Like nothing has been said (nothing been said)
Or take a chance on your love
Oh girl, tell me, where do we go from here (ohhhhhh) yeah...
