I'm in love with you darlene cause you so good to me
And I feel that you need me it's so plain to see
When I'm chained in my self pity
Your tenderness sets me free and I

Feel that your feelin what I get to feelin
Feel that your feelin what I get to feelin
Feel that your feelin what I get to feelin
For you ooh baby ooh baby
Get it up get it up get it up get it up

You just do everything like nobody else
And I need you need you beside me
I wanna give you myself
If I hurt you and you feel bad
Your lovin ways makes me sad and I

Feel that your feelin what I get to feelin
Feel that your feelin what I get to feelin
Feel that your feelin what I get to feelin you

We have eachother In so many ways
We'll have eachother from now on

I keep feelin you I keep feelin you
Every single day baby I keep feelin you
