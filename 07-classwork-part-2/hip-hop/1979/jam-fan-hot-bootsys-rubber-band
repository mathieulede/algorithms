Hey junior, you and Mickey
Time out for being cool
Cause I´m a wild and crazy guy
Hot can I burn
Burnin´ down the house

Hot, burnin´ up the charts
Blow dry me, baby
You want me to be cool
But I´m not

You need a fan
Yeah that´s what you need, baby

La di da di di di da di da

I´m a stubborn fellow got a mind to burn
Don´t tell me to be cool you can be cool when it´s your turn
It´s between you, me, funkin´ afire
Get up, you better get up dance with me

Smoke up, gonna smoke up
Get up and dance with me

Burn up, we gonna burn up

Alright you know I´m a wild and crazy person
You want me to be cool

Burnin´ down the house
Wants to burn, oh burn
