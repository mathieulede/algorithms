Put your makeup on try to fantasize

It's time to get a little crazy

Sometimes it's good to try it out

Just like the dreams in your head

When the heat is on everybody knows

Theyre in the mood to be a hot number

Some dirty talks and mega shock

To get a zing in your fling

Midnight rides and dances

Everybody wants them

Come and fill my wonders

Oh-whoa-oh hot number

If your hips got rhythm youre beyond control

You've always been a little hot number

Some would be hots afraid to show

Don't you know you like to let it go

Take me if you want

You should try it once

Ain't nothin wrong with getting sexy

A love a day's the way to stay

I want to be a hot number

Midnight rides and dances

Everybody wants them

Come and fill my wonders

Oh, oh, oh, hot number

We want to tear you apart

We want to get in your heart

Were hot numbers yeah

You got that look in your eyes

We want to get in your heart

Were hot numbers yeah

Youre outnumbered ooooh

Were hot numbers yeah

Youre outnumbered ooooh wooo

Put your makeup on try to fantasize

This ain't no time to be a lady

Sometimes it's good to try it out

Just like the dreams in your head

Midnight rides and dances

Everybody wants them

Come and fill my wonders

Oh-whoa-oh hot number

Hot number

Hot number

Hot number hoo hoo

I want to be a hot number

Hot number

Hot number

Hot number woo woo

I want to be a hot number

Hot number

Hot number woooooo wooo-oooh

Hot number hoo hoo
