Why don't you let me be good to you?

Why don't you let me be good to you?

Everytime I see you
You look so fine
I wonder what kind of things
Are going on your mind

Why don't you
Why don't we
Get together sometime
So I can be ...

Good to you
I want to be good to you

I can see it in your eyes
You've been hurt real bad
You've given up on love
You're living in the past

Why don't you
Give me a chance
To ease your mind
So I can be ...

Good to you
I want to be good to you

'Cause I know what you want
And I know what you need
You need the same things I do
'Cause I've been hurt many times
Just like you

Let me be good to you
Let me be good to you
While I'm being good to you baby
I want you to be good to me
Let me take care of your problems
I just want to be good to you

Come let me hold you
Let's talk things out
Please let me help you
Erase all of your doubts

Why don't you
Why don't we
Get together tonight

So I can be good to you
I want to be good to you

'Cause I know what you want
Yes, and I know what you need
You need the same things I do
'Cause I've been hurt many times
Just like you

I want to be good to you
Let me be good to you
While I'm being good to you baby
I want you to be good to me
We can help each other baby
Just let me be good to you baby

We've got a long way to go
Why don't you let me be good to you?
Let's always stay together
A-let me be good to you
Well

(Spoken)
You know I was thinking today
You want to do something different tonight
Why don't you come over to my place
Let me put on some dinner for us
Get us a couple of bottles of wine
Then I can just rub your shoulders
And ease all your tensions and your nerves from the day
As a matter of fact I'll even take your shoes off
And rub your feet
'Cause I know you've been on them all day
And you'rel tired and their hot
So listen tell you what you do
After you get home
You know, you get yourself cooled down
Take a nice warm bath
Get all relaxed and refreshed
And come on over
And let me ease the evening for you

(Sung)
Let me be good to you
Let me be good to you

(Spokien)
After we have dinner
Maybe we can go catch a late show
Or maybe we can just stay at the place
And watch a late-night TV movie
Yeah

(Sung)
Let me be good to you
Let me be good to you
I want you to be good to me
Let me be good, good, good
Let me be good to you
Yeah
