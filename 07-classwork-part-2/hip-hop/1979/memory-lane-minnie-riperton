[Verse 1]
I stumbled on this photograph, it kind of made me laugh
It took me way back, back down memory lane
I see the happiness, I see the pain
Where am I? Back down memory lane
I see us standing there, such a happy, happy pair
Love beyond compare, look a-there, look a-there

[Hook]
The way you held me
No one could tell me
That love would die

[Verse 2]
Why did I have to find this photograph? I thought I had forgot the past
Now I'm slipping fast, back down memory lane
I feel the happiness, I feel the pain
Here am I, back down memory lane
I'm in the sunshine, I'm in the rain
I thought it was over, here I go again

[Hook]

[Bridge/Verse 3]
I don't wanna go
Travel up and down
Faster that the speed of sound
Back down memory lane
You steal my foolish heart
Don't let this feeling start
Back down memory lane
I don't wanna go
Back down memory lane
Save me, save me
Back down memory lane
Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me
Back down memory lane
Back down memory lane
Back down memory lane
Back down memory lane
I don't, I know
I know, I don't know, know, know, know
