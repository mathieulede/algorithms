[Verse 1]
I'm glad you're home
Now did you really miss me
I guess you did by the look in your eyes
(look in your eyes, look in your eyes)
Well lay back and relax while I put away the dishes (put away the dishes)
Then you and me can rock-a-bye

[Hook x4]
You can ring my Be-e-el, ring my bell

[Verse 2]
The night is young, and full of possibilities
Well come on, and let yourself be free
My love for you, so long I've been saving
Tonight was made for me and you

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You can ring my bell, you can ring my bell
Ding dong, ding dong, ring it
You can ring my bell, anytime, anyway
Ring it, ring it ring it, owww

[Hook]
