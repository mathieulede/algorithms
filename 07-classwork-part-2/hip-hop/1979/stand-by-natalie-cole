You've got to learn
You've got to learn how to follow the leader
You've got to turn, turn off your pride
And your life will be sweeter

Love comes from God
Surely, surely, surely you can see that
If you check out your heart
There's a part that you're keeping from me

Why don't you hold on tight?
Make this flight
We've got the whole night
Saddle up your gear
Have no fear
We are here, hey

Better make it soon
Give me room
Come on and stand by me
Come on and stand by
Cause there is no time
No time to sit

I'll bet you'll be quick about it
And I know you will
Once you learn that you can't live without it

Lord only knows how long
How long, how long I have waited
And the moment is near
Line 'em up
Get 'em ready at the gate

We're gonna keep em' strong
Moving on
We've got the whole night
No looking back
Where it's at, it's right now, hey

Better make it soon
Give me room
Come on and stand by me

There's gonna be no looking back
So baby, take everything you'll ever need
Sure 'nough moving on
Keep it strong
It's a whole new game and a brand new street

You know, uh
You said you would if you could
I'll make it good to ya

Don't you stop 'til we get to the top
Hey, ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Stand by me

Hey, hey, if it's real
What you feel
Come on and stand by

Don't you stop 'til we get to the top
Hey, ninety-nine and a half just won't do
Stand by me

Come on and stand by
Ha, stand by me
Hey, hey, hey

(Repeat stand by me, hey, hey, hey)
