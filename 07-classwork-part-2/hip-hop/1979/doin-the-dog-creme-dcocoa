I was up here on the dancefloor, and I was looking down
Doing every dance I ever knew
And after a minute, I looked around
Then I saw you
The way you were moving, kept your body grooving
Oh yeah, you know you turn me on
You made it look exciting, and so inviting
Made me wanna do it with you, but what are we doing?
Doing the dog, push, push, push pushing, doing the dog, moving in the high
