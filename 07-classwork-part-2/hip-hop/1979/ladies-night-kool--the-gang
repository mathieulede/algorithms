On disco lights your name will be seen
You can fulfill all your dreams
Party here, party there, everywhere
This is your night, baby, you've got to be there
Come on let's all celebrate

Girls, y'all got one
A night that's special everywhere
You dance, you smile, the guys go wild
So chic so fine you all look so divine

Oh yes it's ladies night and the feeling's right
Oh yes it's ladies night, oh what a night, oh what a night!
Oh yes it's ladies night and the feeling's right
Oh yes it's ladies night, oh what a night

If you hear any noise
It ain't the boys, it's ladies night
Gonna step out ladies night
Stepping out ladies night
Gonna step out ladies night
Stepping out ladies night

Oh yes it's ladies night and the feeling's right
Oh yes it's ladies night, oh what a night, oh what a night!
Oh yes it's ladies night and the feeling's right
Oh yes it's ladies night, oh what a night
