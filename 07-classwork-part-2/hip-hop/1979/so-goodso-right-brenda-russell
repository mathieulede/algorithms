We're on the shores of nowhere
Looking out to sea
I turn and kiss your face and you laugh at me, laugh at me
How do i feel when I feel like rain
Feel like saying
It feels so good so right to be with tonight{chorus}
There is no space between the ocean, you, and me
Exchanging life force as we live and breath
Together we'll be
How do i feel when i feel like saying
Feel like praying
Feels so good so right to be with you tonight{chorus}
You make me feel so young
The way we laugh and play
Like a child in the sun
You know I wanna stay
In love this way
How do i feel when i feel like praying, feel like saying
It;s feels so good so right to be with you tonight
