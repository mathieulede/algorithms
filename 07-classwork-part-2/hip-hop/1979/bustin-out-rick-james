Well, alright you squares it's time we smoked
Get on up this funk and let's have a toke
It'll make you dance and some of everything
Everybody get high, sing

Bustin' out
Bustin' out (Sing)
Bustin' out
Bustin' out
Bustin' out

We're bustin' out of this L-Seven square
Freaks like you and I could never funk from there
We're bustin' out, everybody come along
We're gonna dance on the funk and make love on this song {Bustin' out}
We're bustin' out and if everyone agrees
Put your hands in the air and sing along with me {Bustin' out}

We're bustin' out on the funk {Bustin' out}
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all {Bustin' out}
We're bustin' out on the funk {Bustin' out}
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all {Bustin' out}

Bustin' out (Ow, girl)
Bustin' out (Sing it again)
Bustin' out (Sing it, sing it, sing it, well)
Bustin' out
Bustin' out

We're bustin' out of this serious joint
It was too square for me, do you get my point
We're bustin' out and we're free from the square
We done braided our hair, we don't mind if you stare {Bustin' out}
We're bustin' out and we don't give a damn
If you don't like our funk then take your stuff and scram {Bustin' out}

We're bustin' out on the funk {Bustin' out}
We're bustin' out on some serious funk, y'all {Bustin' out}
We're bustin' out on the funk

We're bustin out, we couldn't wait (We couldn't wait) {Bustin' out}
We're bustin' out 'cause we're too damn straight {Bustin' out}
Now we're all a little free to communicate {Bustin' out}
And we're all a little stoned and we freak when we're at home
And for me I only freak when I'm bustin' out (One more time)
And we're all a little stoned and we freak when we're at home
And for me I only freak when I'm bustin' (So take that)

We're bustin' out on the funk {Bustin' out}
We're bustin' out on some serious funk {Bustin' out}
We're bustin' out on the funk (Sing it, sing it) {Bustin' out}
