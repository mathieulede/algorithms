[Intro: King Tim III]
Alright, y'all
Here we go

[Verse 1: King Tim III]
You just clap your hands and you stomp your feet
''Cause you're listenin' to the sound of this jib jab beat
I'm the K-I-N-G the T-I-M
King Tim III and I am here
Just me, Fatback, and the crew
We doin' it all just for you
We're strong as an ox and tall as a tree
We can rock it so viciously
We throw the highs in your eyes the bass in your face
We're the funk machines that rock the human race
Skate, down, boogie shot
Come on girl let's do the rock
Slam dunk do the jerk
Let me see your body work
To the break everybody (x2)
Two, four, six, eight
Fatback, don't you hesitate

[Verse 2: Fatback Band]
Party people
Who like to groove
Now the time
To let your body move
Do it to the rhythm
And let it all hang out
Don't be drivin'
You got to show what you be about

[Interlude: Fatback Band]
Catch it, catch it, catch it, catch the beat
Catch it, catch the beat (x2)

Do it to me, and I'll do it you (x4)

Catch it, catch it, catch the beat (x2)

Do it to me, and I'll do it to you (say what?)
Do it to me, and I'll do it to you [?]
Do it to me, and I'll do it to you (hey, hey, hey)
Do it to me

[Interlude: King Tim III]
To the break
Just keep the same old beat

[Verse 3: King Tim III]
About a while ago when I want you to know
Just who you been listenin' to
I am the voice of King Tim III
Tell you what I want you to do
A little left hand right hand in the air
And you sway 'em like you just don't care
You put your leg out the right leg in
Say the hustle is out and the rock is in
'Bout a quarter to four somebody was at your door
And you wonder who it was
And you start to shake and shiver
So I said it was me your little old cous'
I said to open the door, and let me in
And I'll rock you so good you won't eat again
I'll rock you so good you heard bells ring
They went "a-ring, ding, dang, a-ding, a-ding, ding"
Ring, ding, dang, a-ding, a-ding, ding
To the break everybody

[Interlude: Fatback Band]
Do it to me, and I'll do it to you (come on)
Do it to me, and I'll do it to you (what'cha gon' do now?)
Do it to me, and I'll do it to you (give it to me)
Do it to me, and I'll do it to you (alright)

[Verse 4: King Tim III]
Stomp your feet and you clap your hands
Cause you're listenin' to the sound of the Fatback Band
Ain't nothin' new in what I do
Cause I'm doin' it all just for you
I'm hotter than tea I'm sweeeter than honey
I'm not doin' it for the money
I'm sugarcoated, double dunked
Chocolate MC Man
I'm sweeter than the Almond Joy
In grandma's sweet old jam
I'm the modified, the rectified
[?]
[?]
To rock your mind say all the time
To the break everybody (x2)
It's on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what some popcorn

[Interlude: Fatback Band]
Do it to me, and I'll do it to you (x16)

[Verse 5: King Tim III (Over Interlude)]
To the break everybody
You either get in the step, the hip in your hop
You don't stop 'til you get on the mountain top
Once you reach the top you won't be alone
You got King Tim on the microphone
You just grab your partner you start to swing
Cause I'm well known just like Burger King
I don't sell burgers or french fries
I'm only here to make your nature right
Just grab your partner around and 'round
Grab her by the butt and boogie down
Just open up her jacket and open her bra
And then just lay in the Mardi Gras
I'm the man of action, the main attraction
The girls call me the satisfaction
I'm the Romeo, the cassanova
Here tonight gonna get over
To the break everybody (x4)
