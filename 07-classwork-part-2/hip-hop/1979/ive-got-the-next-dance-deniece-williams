I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
I'll be waiting on you
'Cause I, I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
You, with you

Sitting here, I've been drinking Cheers
Thought I'd have me some fun
And I'm free being me
While the night's still young

Oh, I've been watching you
(Watching you)
I'm waiting to
(Waiting to)
Well, I've got this in head

Dancing style
(Dance style)
And your smile
(And your smile)
You fit right into my plan

I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
I'll be waiting on you
'Cause I, I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
You, with you

You didn't think I saw you
Out there on the floor
Truth is I've been watching
Since you walked right in the door

So let me make it clear
The moment that you're near
I'm gonna put my hooks in you
There's nothing you can do

I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
That's what I've been waiting for, for
Yeah, yeah

I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
You, with you

I'm reaching out, I'm hoping that
You will take me by my hand
Your soul right into mine
Say you, say you'll be my dancing man

Move this flow, it's time to go
There'll be a place of mine
Me and you
(You and me)

When love is good
(Love is good)
Let's try this one more time
(This dance is mine)

Now that we have met
I'd really like to get
To know the way you feel
About the things I say

So baby, let me know
'Cause I don't wanna go
So give me all your love and we then
We'll dance forever more

I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
That's what I've been waiting for, for
Yeah, yeah

I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
You, with you

I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
You're alright, you make do
You're alright, you make do

I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
You, with you

I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
You're alright, you make do
You're alright, you make do

I've got the next dance
I've got the next dance with you
You, with you
