Keep what you got
Until you get what you need y'all

You got to give a lot
Just to get what you need sometimes y'all

Gimme the bridge now

I feel like busting loose
Busting loose

Gimme the bridge now

I feel like busting loose
Busting loose

Busting loose in the evening
Busting loose can be pleasing
Talking 'bout busting loose

Busting loose in the meantime
Busting loose makes you feel fine
Talking 'bout busting loose

Busting loose to my love Jones
Busting loose to each his own
Talking 'bout busting loose y'all

Busting loose to my love Jones
Busting loose to each his own
Gimme the bridge y'all

I feel like busting loose
Gimme the bridge now
Gimme the bridge now

I feel like busting loose
Busting loose

I said sha la, come on
Y'all said (put your money down)
I said, sha la, get it
Y'all said (put your money down)
I said sha la, come on
Y'all said (put your money down)
I said sha la, hit it
Y'all said (put your money down)

Gimme the bridge now

Now I feel like busting loose
Give me the bridge, y'all
Give me the bridge, y'all now

Now I feel like busting loose
Busting loose now

Busting loose when you want to deal
Busting loose doing what you feel
Talking 'bout busting loose, girl

Busting loose when you want to deal
Busting loose doing what you feel
Talking 'bout busting loose now

Busting loose when you want to sing
Busting loose, baby, do your thing
Talking 'bout busting loose, girl

Busting loose when you want to sing
Busting loose, baby, do your thing
Give me the bridge, y'all

Give me the bridge, y'all
Give me the bridge now, now

I feel like busting loose
Busting loose now
