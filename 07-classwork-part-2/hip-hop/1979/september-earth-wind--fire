[Verse 1]
Do you remember the 21st night of September?
Love was changing the mind of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember, how the stars stole the night away, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus 1]
Hey hey hey
Bada Ya, say do you remember
Bada Ya, dancing in September
Bada Ya, never was a cloudy day

[Bridge]
Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda

[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember, how we knew love was here to stay
Now December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

[Chorus]
Hey hey hey
Bada Ya, say do you remember
Bada Ya, dancing in September
Bada Ya, never was a cloudy day

There was a
Bada Ya, say do you remember
Bada Ya, dancing in September
Bada Ya, golden dreams were shiny days

[Verse 3]
The bell was ringing
Our souls were singing
Do you remember every cloudy day

[Chorus 2]
There was a
Bada Ya, say do you remember
Bada Ya, dancing in September
Bada Ya, never was a cloudy day
And we'll say
Bada Ya, say do you remember
Bada Ya, dancing in September
Bada Ya, golden dreams were shiny days

[Outro]
Bada ya da ya da ya
Bada ya da ya da ya
Bada ya da ya da ya da ya
Bada ya da ya da ya
Bada ya da ya da ya
Bada ya da ya da ya da ya
