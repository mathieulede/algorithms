I'm, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
Cause you make me feel, so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Let me say that since, baby, since we've been together
Loving you forever is what I need
Oh let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Oh baby let's, let's stay together
Lovin' you whether

Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad, oh yeah

Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

Why somebody
Why people break up, turn around and make up
I just can't see, you'd never do that to me, would you baby?
Just being around you is all I see, it's what I want to do

Let's, we ought to stay together
Lovin' you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

C'mon, let's, let's stay together
I'll keep on lovin' you whether, whether
Times are, oh times are good or times are bad
