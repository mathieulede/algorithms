You promised me things that meant a lot
Said so much you just up and forgot
What you said to me, about me

You said, I was your strength, the air you breathe
So, help me, honey, you're all I need
To make my life complete
Oh, yes, you did

So then
(Why, why don't you?)
Why, why don't you, baby?
(Make her the woman that you go home to)
Make me the woman you go home to

And not the one you leave behind
(Make her the woman you go home to)
Not the one you left to cry
(Make her the woman you go home to)

With a smile, I fix your evening meals
Iron your clothes, it ain't no big deal
It's all a part of loving you
(Loving you, yes, it is)

Stick by your side through thick and thin
Not laying awake to, ask where you been
Cause you'd tell me if you wanted to
(If you wanted to)
Oh, yeah

(Why, why don't you?)
So, why, why don't you, baby?
(Make her the woman you go home to)
Make me the woman you go home to

And not the one you leave behind
(Make her the woman you go home to)
Not that one that's left to cry and cry
(Make her the woman you go home to)

(Make her the woman you go home to)
Make me the woman
(Make her the woman you go home to)
You go home to

Make me yours and you'll be mine to keep
So full of joy, you wouldn't need to be
On the other side of town
Fooling around

[Incomprehensible] is all you get
Knowing this, you will never regret
Finding yourself all around

So
(Why, why don't you?)
Why? Why?
Oh, good God Almighty, boy
(Make her the woman you go home to)

And not that one that you leave behind
(Make her the woman you go home to)
Not the one that's left to cry and cry
(Make her the woman you go home to)

I don't, I don't know what you want
(Make her the woman you go home to)
Make me your woman, oh, baby
(Make her the woman you go home to)

Oh, I don't know why
(Make her)
