You're still a young man
Baby, Oo oo, don't waste your time
You're still a young man
Baby, Oo oo, don't waste your time

Down on my knees
Oh, heart in hand
I was accused of being too young
But I'm not so young
I could make you happy
I'm not a bad man

You're too young to love (If you and I could be together)
You're too young to love (I'll never never leave you alone baby)
You're too young Ooo Ooo (No I won't sweet lady)
Don't waste your time

The damage is done
You see that you were wrong
You wake up wondering just
How well I've done
Well I've done alright
Yes there are some girls but you know
I dropped them on sight
Just for you
Because I love you

You're still a young man
Baby, Oo oo, don't waste your time
(Someday you'll understand just what it means when a man
Comes to you with his little heart in his hands
Just to love you)
Don't waste your time

You better listen to me
Sayin that I'm loving you yeah hey now baby tryin to tell
You that it's you you you you you you you you talkin to you
Baby, I'll never never never never I'll never never do you
No wrong no no lady if you would check my stuff out one time haha
Just to hold you, just to squeeze you and all I wanna do is to
Get next to you and please please please you baby
See where I'm comin from!
