It's your world, baby
And everything in it belongs to you
Go on and hurt me
If that's what you wanna do

I know we're soon gonna part
So go on, make your start
And do what you set out to do

One way or another, woman
You got to make up your mind
I said, "I'm tired of playing games
And I don't want you wasting my time"

You got my heart breaking
Lord, my lonely arms aching
So go and do what you set out to do

Lord, go on and hurt me
If that's what you wanna do
Leave me, desert me
Let's get it over and through

I know you soon we gonna part
Lord, go and make your start
And do what you set out to do

I said, "It's your world, baby
And everything in it belongs to you"
Go on and hurt me
If that's what you wanna do

I know soon we're gonna part
Lord, go on and make your start
And do what you set out to do

You can leave me
You can leave me
You can lie, you can cheat
And deceive me
