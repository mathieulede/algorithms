[Hook]
Bound, bound
Bound to fall in love

[Verse 1]
You started with a mere hello
Then you learned her name
You notice her finer qualities
And the magic of her rare personality

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You ask what sign she is
And you find that you're compatible
You realize how fine she is
She's just what you've been looking for

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
Wooo, wooo
Wooo, wooo
Wooo, wooo
Wooooooooo

[Outro]
Don't you try to resist
Cause you're bound
Bound to fall in love
Won't you try it again cause you know you're bound
Bound to fall in love
