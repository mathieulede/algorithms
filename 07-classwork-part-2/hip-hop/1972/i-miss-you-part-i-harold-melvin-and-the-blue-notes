(Miss you) Mmm, hmm

Every since you went away
I ain't been doing nothing but
(Thinking, thinking) [x2]
With my head in my hands
(Thinking)

You been away from so long
And I just don't think I can carry on so I start
(Drinking, drinking) [x2]
Each and every night
(Drinking)

(Ah... ah... ah...)
Trying to drown all my loneliness away
I don't forget a day
Fall down on my knees wishing for your return
And oh, how I hurt

'Cause I (Oh, I) Oh, I (Oh, I)
(Miss you) I miss you, baby
(Miss you)
(Miss you, miss you)
Oh, Lord (Miss you)

You can look at my eyes and see
That a great big man like me has been
(Crying, crying) [x2]
Crying my heart and soul out to you, baby
(Crying)

Sitting in my lonely room
Filled with nothing but gloom and I feel like
(Dying, dying) [x2]
Hey, y'all help me
(Dying)

(Ah... ah... ah...)
'Cause ever since the day you left
I don't know what to do with myself
Oh... I wish for your return
And oh, how I hurt

'Cause I (Oh, I) Oh, I (Oh, I)

(Miss you, miss you)
I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Without you I don't know what to do with myself, what to do with my time

Hmm
Hello
Did I disturb you
I didn't mean to take up too much of your time but
Just thought I'd give you a ring and see how you was doing
How's, how's everything
A friend of mine told me he saw you the other day
Said you was still looking good
Heh, made me feel kind of good, you know
Told me, told me that you did ask about me
Heh
I been really meaning to try to get to talk to you
For now but
You know how a man's pride is
Sometimes it kind of won't let him do what he wanna do

(Oh, I) Yeah, baby
(Oh, I), come back to me, darling
(Miss you, miss you) [x2]
(Miss you, miss you)
I don't want nobody else, hey, hey, baby (Miss you)
(Oh, I, Oh, I) Hey, baby
(Miss you, miss you)
I miss you, baby
(Miss you, miss you, miss you)
I miss you, baby, I don't know what to do with my time, with myself
Without you, baby

Hmm, guess what
I know this will knock you dead but
I even went out and got a gig
Oh, forgot you know hip to the hip talk
Plain J-O-B, baby
In eight hours a day, all the overtime I can get
I don't know, I guess it might be too late but
I swear I miss you

(Oh, I, Oh, I) Yeah, Lord knows
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you)
Don't do me like this, baby (Miss you, miss you)
Yeah, I'm on my knees, I'm begging you please
(Oh, I, Oh, I)
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, I miss you, baby
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you)
Oh, Lord (Miss you, miss you)
Hey, girl, hey, girl
Hey, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Oh, I, Oh, I)
I can't go on without you, baby
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you, miss you, miss you)
What am I gonna do, what can I say
I love you, baby, ha

Heh, remember how I used to always say how lucky I done been
You know being they got that lottery, I hit it
I'd like to kind of make up for
A lot of things that just seemed not to go right
Don't want you to think I'm trying to buy back your love or your friendship
But now I feel I got a chance to kind of make things up to you a little bit
Heh, enough about you and me
How's my little son?
Hmm, he ever ask about me?
Just a little bit
Does he still like to go down by the supermarket?
If I could just
If I could just see you
Can't really say what you mean or what you want over the phone
I swear I miss you
You done heard it ten times or more but
I swear I done changed [x2]

(Oh, I, Oh, I) I miss you, baby
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you, miss you) Oh, Lord)
Miss you, baby, yeah, baby, yeah, baby, yeah, baby
(Oh, I, Oh, I)
(Miss you, miss you)
(Miss you, miss you, miss you, baby)
