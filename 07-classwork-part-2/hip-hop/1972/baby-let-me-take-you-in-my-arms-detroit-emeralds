Baby, let me take you
Let me take you in my arms
Let me take you in my
Arms and hold you
Show you I love you
Baby, I love you
Baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you
Don't love nobody else
You got my love
Just for yourself
Baby, let me kiss you
Baby, baby, let me
Kiss your lips
Let me kiss you
Til I feel your soul
Can't you see
That I need you
And if you feel the same
Tell me that you love me too
And when you call my name
Try to feel the way I do
Baby, let me feel you
Baby, baby, let me
Feel your soul
Let me feel you put
Your soul in mine
Gonna make you love me
Baby, let me hold you
Let me hold you
In my loving arms
Baby, baby, let me
Feel your charms
Show you I love you
Baby, I love you
(I love you, baby)
And if you feel the same
Tell me that you love me too
And when you call my name
Try to feel the way I do
Don't love nobody else
You got my love
Just for yourself
Can't you see the
Love vibrations
Don't you feel them
Sweet sensations
Baby, baby, let me
Kiss your lips
And if you feel the same
Tell me that you love me too
And when you call my name
Try to feel the way I do
Baby, let me take you
Let me take you in my arms
Let me take you in my
Arms and hold you
Show you I love you
Baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you
Don't love nobody else
You got my love
Just for yourself
Can't you see the
Love vibrations
Don't you feel them
Sweet sensations
Don't you feel
This warm embrace
Why don't you give my
Love a chance
