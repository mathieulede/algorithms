[Verse 1]
Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It is not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I am at
You do not have to worry because I am coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I have heard the maybe to your story
And it is enough love for me to stay

Can it be I stayed away too long
Did I leave your mind when I was gone
It is not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I am at

[Chorus]
I want to, want to be where you are
Anywhere you are
I want to, want to be where you are
Everywhere you are

[Verse 2]
Please do not close the door to our future
There are so many things we have not tried
I could love you better than I used to
And give you all the love I have inside

[Chorus]
I want to, want to be where you are
Any, any, anywhere you are
I want to, want to be where you are
I got to be where you are
