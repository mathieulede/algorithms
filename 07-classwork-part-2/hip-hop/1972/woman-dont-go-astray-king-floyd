Woman don't run away, baby, don't ya go astray
Please don't do me, ah, tell me that you're gonna stay
'Cause baby, I love you, can't you see that I need you?
You talk so fancy, your kisses taste like candy

That is why I'll be lost if you leave me
It will tear my poor heart to pieces
Baby, my world will crumble right down
Do you expect me to accept this much hurt?
Well, I'm beggin' down on my knees
Little darlin', please don't leave

Whoa, baby, woman don't go astray
Please don't do me that way
Just tell me that you're gonna stay
Ah, baby, I love ya, can't you see that I need ya?
Life's no good here without ya, girl, I'm crazy about ya
I think I'll say it again, crazy about ya

That is why I'll be lost if you leave me
It will tear my poor heart to pieces
Honey, my world will crumble right down to dirt
Do you expect me to accept this much hurt?
Well, I'm beggin' down on my knees
Little darlin', please don't leave me

Don't leave me, please
I'm beggin', please don't leave me
I'm beggin' down on my knees, little darlin'
