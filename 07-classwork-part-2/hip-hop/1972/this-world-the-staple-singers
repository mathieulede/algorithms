This world, this world, my mind holds this world
My mind holds this world in its hands
This world, this world, my mind holds this world
My mind holds this world in its hands

And when I think about this world
I can shape it just like clay
I can make myself a Garden of Eden
Or throw it all away

This world, this world, my mind holds this world
My mind holds this world in its hands
This world, this world, my mind holds this world
My mind holds this world in its hands

And when I spin this world around
I can turn night into day
I can make myself a sunny tomorrow
Or bring back yesterday
Yesterday, I can bring back yesterday

This world, this world, my mind holds this world
My mind holds this world in its hands
This world, this world, my mind holds this world
My mind holds this world in its hands
