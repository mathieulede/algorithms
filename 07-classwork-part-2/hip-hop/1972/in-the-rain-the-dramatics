I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy but I wanna go outside
In the rain
Cause I think I'm gonna cry
And I don't want you to see me cry
Once the rain starts falling on my face
You won't see a single trace, of the tears I'm crying
Because of you I'm crying
Don't want you to see me cry
Let me go , let me go , let me go
Once the sun comes out and the rain is gone
Away I know I gonna see a better day
Right now I think I'm crying
Because of you I'm crying
Don't want ypu to see me cry
I wanna go outside in the rain
It may sound crazy, it may sound crazy but I
Wanna go outside in the rain
