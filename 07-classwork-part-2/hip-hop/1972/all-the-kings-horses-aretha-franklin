[Verse]
All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again
I woke up this morning that this is what I found
You had gone and left me
Any you never even made a farewell sound
All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again
I asked my friends about you and this is what they said
"She can live without you
She's gonna find a man with money instead."
All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again
Someday you will know, the meaning of a love that's true
But when you find out I won't be around to share it with you

[Outro]
All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again
All the king's horse and all the king's men
They couldn't put my broken heart back together again
