Someday, you're going to miss me
Someday, you're gonna cry
Someday, you'll see
When I say goodbye
Someday, when you grow lonely
You're gonna wish for my love only
Someday, your heart's gonna break like you caused mine
To ache
Someday
Many a heart has been broken
And you're no exception to the rule
For I've just gotta be plain spoken
For I'm so tired of being your fool
Someday, when you grow lonely
You're gonna wish for my love only
Someday, your heart's gonna break
Like you caused mine to ache
Someday
