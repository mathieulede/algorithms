You've been goin' around talking
Sayin' he's young enough to be my son, uh huh
But you can't blame him
'Cause you left your job half-done, yes you did
Now you're tellin' everybody
That I rob a cradle
Oohh, what a cradle I robbed
So just get outa the way
And let a boy do a man-sized job
Oh yeah
Well when you had what he's got
You didn't know what to do with what you had
Oh no
So put the blame where it belongs, boy
I know you feel real bad, uh huh
But if the groove don't move
I'm not the kind to sit around and sulk, oh no
So just get out the way
And let a boy do a man-sized job
That's what you better do now
See, he's young enough, not to be old-fashioned
And old enough, not to be naive
He's young enough for a whole lot of action
And old enough to know how to please
Hey hey hey, yeah, alright
Why you're goin' around tellin' everybody
Just how you made me feel, uh huh
You see time is movin' on, boy
But you're the one standin' still
Oh yeah
Oh, you're tellin' everybody that I robbed a cradle
Oohh what a cradle I robbed
So just get outa the way
And let a boy do a man-sized job
Woah you can't take it, baby
Just get outa the way
And let a boy do a man-sized job
Woah you can't have it, baby
Just get outa the way
And let a boy do a man-sized job
It's just so much more, baby
So just get outa the way
And let a boy do a man-sized job
You know you can't handle it
