[Pre-Chorus]
He rocks in the tree tops all day long
Hopping and a-Bopping and singing his song
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet

[Chorus]
Rocking robin, rock rock
Rocking robin
Blow rocking robin
Because we are really going to rock tonight

[Verse 1]
Every little swallow, every chick-a-Dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flapping their wings singing go bird go

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started going steady and bless my soul
He out-bopped the Buzzard and the Oriole

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
