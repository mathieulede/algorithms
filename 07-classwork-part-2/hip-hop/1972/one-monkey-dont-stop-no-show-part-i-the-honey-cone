The show must go on

One monkey don't stop no show
If you don't want my love, you're free to go
(You can go, you can go, you can go)

Life is a play, we play different parts
But to be a star in love, you've got to feel it in your heart
You've been acting strange, you don't love me with soul
Well, there's lots of other guys who'd love to play your role

If you don't want to be my leading man
Get out of my life and let me live again
(You can go, you can go)
Ah, the show must go on!

Hey, one monkey don't stop no show
If you really need our love, you'd better let it show
(Let it show, let it show, let it show)

Once we had a love you couldn't live without
(Wee-op, chop, chop, shooby-doo-doo-wop)
The greatest love that heaven has ever put out
(Wee-op, chop, chop, shooby-doo-doo-wop)
Success has gone to your head; you wanna be free
(Wee-op, chop, chop, shooby-doo-doo-wop)
Ooo, don't you realize your backbone is me?
(Wee-op, chop, chop, shooby-doo-doo-wop)

If you no longer like your part
Get out of my life before you ruin my heart
(You can go, you can go)
Ah, the show must go on!

(Wee-op, chop, chop, shooby-doo-doo-wop)
(Wee-op, chop, chop, shooby-doo-doo-wop)
(Wee-op, chop, chop, shooby-doo-doo-wop)
(Wee-op, chop, chop, shooby-doo-doo-wop)

You can go, there's the door, you can go, you can go

One monkey don't stop no show
If you don't want my love, you're free to go
(You can go, you can go, you can go)
I said, one monkey don't stop no show
If you really need our love, you'd better let it show
(Let it show, let it show, let it show)
