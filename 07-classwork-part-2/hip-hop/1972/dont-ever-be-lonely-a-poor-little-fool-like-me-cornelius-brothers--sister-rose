Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me

Oh, I sit down
And I moan sometime
Over a big mistake I made
Didn't take time to love her
And it caused her love to fade

Oh, if you have true love
(If you have true love)
Take a tip from a man in misery

Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me

Oh, I see how much I was wrong
To avoid such a love so true
But now I really miss her
And I see what loneliness can do

Oh, if you have true love
(If you have true love)
Take a tip from a man in misery

Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me

Oh, I wish I could
Turn back the time and
Have her back here with me
I'd do anything to keep her
To avoid this pain and misery

For those that's happy
(For those that's happy)

Take a tip from a man in miser

Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me

(I beg you)
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
(Oh, no, don't you
Ever be lonely)
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me

(I beg you)
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
(It would be lonely)
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me

(Take some time, baby)
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
(Never be lonely)
Don't ever be lonely
A poor little fool like me
