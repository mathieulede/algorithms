[Verse 1]
Mary wants to be a superwoman
But is that really in her head
But I just want to live each day to love her
For what she is
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind
[Chorus 1] [x2]
But, very well, I believe I know you-very well
Wish that you knew me too-very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head

[Verse 2]
Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that she will get by with a dream
My woman want to be a superwoman
And I just had to say good-bye
Because I can't spend all my hours start to cry

[Chorus 2]
But, very well, I believe I know you
Very well wish that you knew me too
Very well, And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Your filthy head

[Bridge]
Very well, dum dum da, dum dum da
Very well, wish you knew me too
Very well, And I wish I could think of everything going through your head
Very well, dum dum da, dum da, dum da
Dum dum da, dum da, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head

[Verse 3]
When the summer came you were not around
Now the summer's gone and love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you-last winter, my love?
When the winter came you went further south
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past
When the winter came you were not around
Through the bitter winds love could not be found
Where were you when I needed you, last winter, my love?
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past oh
Spring will fill the air and you will come around
With your summer love that will let me down
Where were you when I needed you, last winter, my love?
[Bridge]
La la la la la, la la la la la [x2]
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Right now, right now, right now

[Outro]
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my dear
I need you baby, I need you baby, I need you baby
Oh, Where were you when I needed you last winter, last winter
Yea, Need you Baby, need you, need you baby
Oh, you want me too need you baby
Oh where were you when I needed you last, dear
