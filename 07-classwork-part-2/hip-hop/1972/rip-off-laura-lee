I'm setting him up
All for the rip off, girls
I'm setting him up
All for the rip off girls

My man never gives me credit
He all ways plays me cheap
But a woman is thinking
While her man is fast to sleep

I know he's cheating
But I'm sweet as I can be
He thinks he's making a
A fool outta me

But I'm setting him up
All for the rip off girls
(That's all it is)
I'm setting him up
All for the rip off girls

Early in the mornin'
(Uh, huh)
He put his key in the door
(Yeah)
With his shoes in his hands
I meet him tippin' across the floor
(I know he's tippin')

I was a smilin'
Had his slippers for his feet
Coffee in the pot
And somethin' good to eat

'Cause I'm setting him up
All for the rip off girls
(He don't even know it)
I'm setting him up
All for the rip off girls

Ah, but one of these days
He's gonna walk through that door
And girls his good thing will be gone
I'm movin' him out

Starting with the sofa, the chairs
And both TVs, I feel like he owe it all to me
I'm not gonna leave him a box to sit on
The bed and the freezer full of food will be gone

I'm taking the carpet off the floor
And wall paper off the walls
I'm taking the telephone
So he can't make no calls

This fool is in for the shock of his life
I'm tired of being neglected, I
I'm gonna slap him in the face
With the unexpected

'Cause I'm setting him up
All for the rip off girls
(He don't know it)
Setting him up
All for the rip off girls

He's dreamin' and I'm scheming
Ha, ha, ha, ha
And he's trippin' while I'm rippin', ha
It ain't nothin' but a rip off

I'm setting him up
All for the rip off girls
Rip off, hey, that's all it is
