Eddie's love (Eddie's love)

I could build you a palace of pearls a tower of diamond rings I could pave you a street with gold but these are meaningless thigns all the gifts in the world can't convey what my heart has to say what I give to you every day all my love all my love

(Eddie's love) Eddie's love

I could write you a poem so sweet composed with a song to sing I could write you a book of love but these are meaningless things all the gifts in the world can't convey what my heart has to say what I give to you every day all my love all my love

(Eddie's love) Eddie's love

I could fly you beyond the sun fill your pockets with new things I could capture for you a star but these are meaningless things all the gifts in the world can't convey what my heart has to say what I give to you every day all my love all my love

(Eddie's love) Eddie's love if you want it you got it (Eddie's love) you got it! (Eddie's love) I wanna say it I got to say it again (Eddie's love) Eddie's love
