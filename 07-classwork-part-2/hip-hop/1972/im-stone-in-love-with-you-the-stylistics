If I could I'd like to be, a great big movie star
An overnight sensation, drive a big expensive car
I would buy you everything your little heart desires
These things I do, 'cause I'm stone in love with you
(Stone in love with you)

If I were a business man, I'd sit behind a desk
I'd be so successful, I would scare Wall Street to death
I would hold a meeting for the press to let them know
I did it all, 'cause I'm stone in love with you
(Stone in love with you)

I'm just a man, an average man
Doing everything the best I can
But if I could, I'd give the world to you
I'd like to someday be the owner of the first house on the Moon
There would be no neighbors, and no population boom
You might say that all I do is dream my life away
I guess it's true, 'cause I'm stone in love with you

I guess it's true, 'cause I'm stone in love with you
I guess it's true, 'cause I'm stone in love with you
