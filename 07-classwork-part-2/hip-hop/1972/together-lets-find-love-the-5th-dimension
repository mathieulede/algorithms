I don't know much about
This thing called love
But I'm willing to try

I don't know much
About it either, baby
But if you're willing
Then, so am I

Together, we will
Float away in a dream
On our own private cloud
If you know what I mean, oh

[Chorus:]
Together, oh, baby
Let's find love
Baby, baby, you and me
Together, oh, baby
Let's find love
Baby, baby, you and me
That's the way it's got to be

I don't know much
About the feeling shared
When two lovers kiss

Oh, and I don't know much
About it either, baby
But I'm willing to find out
What I missed

Together, we'll pursue
Love to the extreme
Let's not miss a thing, girl
If you know what I mean, oh

[Repeat Chorus]
Oh, oh, together, oh, oh
Baby, let's find love
Baby, baby, you and me
Together, oh, oh
Baby, let's find love
Together, baby, you and me
That's the way it's got to be

Oh, oh, together, oh, oh
Baby, let's find love
Baby, baby, you and me
Together, oh, oh
Baby, let's find love
Together, baby, you and me
That's the way it's got to be
