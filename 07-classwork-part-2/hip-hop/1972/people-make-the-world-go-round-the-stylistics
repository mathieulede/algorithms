Trash men didn't get my trash today
Oh, why? Because they want more pay
Buses on strike want a raise in fare
So they can help pollute the air

But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground, young man
People make the world go round

Wall Street losin' dough on every share
They're blaming it on longer hair
Big men smokin' in their easy chairs
On a fat cigar without a care

But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people's heads around
Go underground, young man
People make the world go round

But that's what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people, [Incomprehensible] all around
Go underground, young man
People make the world go round

People make the world go round
People make the world go round
People make the world go round
