Little bitty pretty one
Come on and talk to me
Lovey dovey lovely one
Come sit down on my knee

That happened a long time ago
Little pitty pretty one
I've been watching you grow

Little bitty pretty one
Come on and talk to me
Lovey dovey lovely one
Come sit down on my knee

Come on everybody
Let's put our hands together and sing along
Come on, come on
I'm saying
Come on

I can tell you a story
That happened a long time ago
Little bitty pretty one
I've been watching you grow
