[Instrumental break]
[Verse 1]
I'm taking care of business, woman can't you see?
I gotta make it for you, and I've gotta make it for me!
Ohh, sometimes it may seem, girl, I'm neglecting you --
I'd love to spend more time --
But I got so many things to do --
[Chorus]
Ohh, I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work, baby! (I got work to do)
I got a job, baby! (I got work to do)
Said, I got work to do! (I got work to do)
[Verse 2]
Well, I'm out here trying to make it, baby can't you see?
It takes a lot of money to make, it let's talk truthfully!
So keep your love lights burning --
And a little food hot in my plate --
You might as well get used to me coming home a little late --
[Chorus]
Ohhh, I - I got work to do
I got a job, (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)
I got work to do (I got work to do)

Whaaaaa Ha Ha!

(Background singing: Da=Do Do-Do Do-Do
Da-Do Do-Do Doo-Da-Do Da-Do-Da-Do Da-Do Doo-Doo 3x)
[Verse 3]
I'm taking care of business
Woman, can't you see?
I gotta make it for you, I gotta make it for me!
Don't wanna make you feel I'm neglecting you --
I'd love to spend more time, oh
Oh, but I got so many things to do!
[Chorus]
Ohhh, I - I got work to do
Ive got work, baby! (I got work to do)
Ive got a job, baby! (I got work to do)
Well, Ive got work to do! (I got work to do)
Everybody's got work to do! (I got work to do)
