Yeah, hey
Ahh, mmm

You're my life when shadows fall
You're my hope when faith is lost
You're my shelter from the storms
When winter's cold, you keep me warm
(Keep me warm)

Life was just an empty dream
Until your love captured me
(Captured me)
And if I should lose your tender touch
I would have lost the very joy I need so much

Oh, oh, ooh, yeah
Oh, oh, woo, yeah

You're my life, my everything
The melody in every song I sing
No sorrow do I know
When you hold me so close
(Hold me close)

As long as I've got you
My world is never blue

Now I don't know where faith will lead us
But just in case destiny somehow
Should lead our hearts astray
Baby, I would always need you to remember
These very words I'm about to say

I could never be happy without you
(Oh, no)
I could never be happy without you
I could never be happy without you
(Baby)

I could never be happy without you
I could never be happy without you
(You got to understand)
I could never be happy without you
I could never be happy without you
You're my life, ooh

I'll never be happy
(No, no)
Without you
(Baby, baby, never, never be)
I could never be happy without you
(Never, never, never, never, never, never)

Never be happy
(Oh, no)
Without you
(Got to understand)
I could never be happy without you
