(Lookin' through the windows)
(Lookin' through the windows)
(ah, oh, lookin' through the windows)
(look, look, looking through the windows)
(Lookin' through the windows)

Lookin' through the windows
The window to your heart
Oh, baby, yeah
I can it's cloudy
The rain is about to start

Lookin' through the windows
(Lookin' through the windows)
It seems I caused your fears
Yeah, yeah, yeah
And that little doubt girl
(And that little doubt girl)
And now it's bringing tears
(bringing, bringing tears)

(remember)
Just remember whatever makes you feel that way
Don't you worry 'cause I'm gonna stay
Right by your side
Too keep on lookin' through the windows
Lookin' in your eyes
(lookin, lookin' in you eyes, eyes, eyes)
(lookin, lookin in you eyes, eyes, eyes)

Lookin' through the windows
(Lookin' through the windows)
Seems like the only way, yeah
(ah, ah)
I can know your feelings
If you still love me today

(remember)
Just remember whatever makes you feel that way
Don't you worry 'cause I'm gonna stay
Right by your side
Too keep on lookin' through the windows
Lookin' in your eyes
(lookin', lookin' in you eyes, eyes, eyes)
(lookin', lookin' in you eyes, eyes, eyes)

(Lookin' through the windows)
(The window to your heart)
(ah ah)
(Lookin' through the windows)
(The window to your heart)

(Za ta ta ra ta ta ta)
Oh, baby!
