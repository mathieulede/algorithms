You know, sometimes a man will
Cause such heartache (yes, he will)
That a woman feels she only take
He'll make all kind of mistakes
(Yes, he will) that cause your
Heart to break

Seems like every day
Is like the one before
The things you used to say
You don't say anymore

Bits and pieces of your time
Are all you can afford
It looks like you just can't see
That there's much more to love

Than bed and board (bed and board)
Bed, bed, bed, bed and board
(Bed and board)

Lying half awake
I hear you switch the light
You turn off the late news
Oh, I'm in luck tonight

You think that making love
Three times a week is my reward
Well, you can't seem to understand
That there's much more to love

Than bed and board (bed and board)
Ooh, baby, bed and board
(Bed and board) oh, don't you know

Don't know what happened
But you've changed somehow
And like a puppet
On a string, baby, oh

You're only going
Through the motions now
You touch me but you don't
Feel anything, anything

You're gonna say
That it's all in my mind
Lord knows how I've thought it out
At least a thousand times

I've got to try again
I need my faith in life restored
I can't wait any longer 'cause
There's much more to love

Than bed and board (bed and board)
Baby, bed, bed, bed and board
(Bed and board) so right there
You oughta listen cause what else

So much more to life
Than just a bed and a roof
Saying, I believe
I believe that a man
Will misuse a woman
If he's given the chance

And I believe
That he will abuse a woman
At the beginning of a romance

'Cause all they ever want is bed (bed)
Your bed (bed) my bed (bed) his bed
It don't make any difference where it is

See, but I don't find anything wrong
With making a little love
On an early Sunday morning
You oughta be in church (amen)

Ain't nothing wrong (amen)
With a little love on an early
Monday morning, Monday morning
(Monday morning)

When your baby's supposed
To be going to work
He can't leave you, no, no, no
He can't leave your side
And here's why

Because a man needs love
And a man needs to be hugged
And kissed, yes, he does

You know it's something when
We ladies start to prepare
Ourselves for that particular man
Waiting for him to come home
So he can just hold our hand

You know, I believe that all of
That all you do something like this
You might run the water
Putting all of those nice things
Into that tub

And when we're finished
We have all kinds of sweet
Smelling things that we put on
Perfumes and some of us decide to
Just powder ourselves all the way down
That's good because that's what they like

And when he comes through the door
And you're lying there in your negligee
Or whatever it might be

And he says to you
I'm too tired, I'm too tired
And you turn to him and say
Do you think I did all this for me

You can still hear that same moan from him
I'm too tired, I've been working all day
But you don't wanna hear that, do you

You see, because the art of making love
Has to be done in a certain way
And it can only been done when
Two people become totally involved

But sometimes a man
Just out of forgetfulness
Will not remember a woman's birthday
And it's not intentional
It's just because it's the way they're made

And they'll forget to call you
Exactly on the hour because
They forget that little things
Mean a lot

'Cause there's so much more to life
Than bed and board
