[Verse 1]
Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I will never be alone
And you my friend will see
You have got a friend in me
(You have got a friend in me)

[Verse 2]
Ben, you are always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you are not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And do not like what you find
There is something you should know
You have got a place to go
(You have got a place to go)

[Verse 3]
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it is "us", now it is "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it is "us", now it is "we"

[Verse 4]
Ben, most people would turn you away
I do not listen to a word they say
They do not see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I am sure they did think again
If they had a friend like Ben
(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben
