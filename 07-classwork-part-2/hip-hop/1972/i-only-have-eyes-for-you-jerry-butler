My love must be a kind of blind love
Girl, I don't see anything but you

Are the stars out tonight
I don't know if it's cloudy or bright
'Cause I only have eyes
Yeah, baby, for you, dear

Oh, the moon may be high
But I tell you, I can't
See a thing in the sky
'Cause I only have eyes for you

Hey, baby, baby
I don't know, I just don't know
I just don't know if we're in
A garden or, baby, maybe just
Strolling down some crowded avenue

But you're here, so am I
And although we see so
Many people passing us by

I only have eyes
I tell you, all of my eyes
They gonna stay on you

Hey, baby, have I told you
That I don't see nothing
In this whole world but you

You are my bright, my bright
My bright and shining star
And everywhere you happen to go
Girl, my eyes are right there

Tell you, 'cause I only, only
I said, I only, oh, baby, I only
I just keep seeing you...
