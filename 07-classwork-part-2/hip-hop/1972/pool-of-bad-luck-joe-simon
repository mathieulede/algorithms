I tripped and I fell
In this pool of bad luck
I got soaked to the bone
In this pool of bad luck

Help me, help me, somebody
Help me, help me, somebody, yeah

Oh, I just can't get over you
No matter how hard I try
Seems like it's always raining
When I hang my heart out to dry

Oh, I got a broken heart
That's a very serious injury
Got me laying flat on my back
In this bed of misery

Since I tripped and I fell
In this pool of bad luck
I got soaked to the bone
In this pool of bad luck

I need your love to rescue me
But you don't need me now that I'm down
Remember every dog has his day
And chances go around

Since I tripped and I fell
In this pool of bad luck
I got soaked to the bone
In this pool of bad luck

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, help me, help me, somebody
Help me, help me, somebody, yeah

Oh, I tripped and I fell
In this pool of bad luck
I got dipped and I got dunked
In this pool of bad luck

Tellin' you, yeah
Oh, why don't you help me
Why don't you help me, yeah
