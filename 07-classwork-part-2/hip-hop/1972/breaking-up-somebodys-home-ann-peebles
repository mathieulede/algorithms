See, lying here all alone
On a rainy night like this
Starvin' for some lovin'
Hungry for just one kiss
Every rain drop I hear
Against my window pane
Beatin' so loud and clear
Words, words that speak your name

See I, I got no where to turn
Now that you have gone
And I feel like
Breaking up somebody's home

I know it's useless
Hangin' on when you belong to someone else
But I can't shake the feelin'
Oh, after all, I didn't make this bed
I got no where to turn
Na, na, na, now, na, now, now that you have gone

I saw the boy last night
And I believe I caught a chill
Well, I could, I could not control the vibration
And my heart, my heart
My heart justa would not stand still
I got no where to turn
A now, now, now, now that you have gone
And I feel like
Breaking up somebody's home
Got no where, a no where to run
And I'm so damn tired of being all alone
And I feel like
Breaking up somebody's home
