Every single day
I got a heartache comin my way
I don't want to say goodbye
But look at the tears you made me cry
I don't wanna say goodbye, mama
But look at the way you made me cry, yeah
Every way this dies
Youve got a heart that's made of ice
That's why I know
(fire and water has to make you their daughter)
Youve got what it takes
To make a poor man heart break
A poor man heart break
Woman you turn me on
As quick as a flash, your love is gone
Baby Im gonna leave you now
Ah, I got to make you believe somehow
That fire and water have to make you their daughter
You got what it takes
To make a poor man heart break
A poor man heart break

Instrumental Ah!

AAAWWWWOOOO!
I don't wanna say goodbye
But look at the way you made me cry, yeah
Every way this dies
You gotta heart that's made of ice
That's why I know fire and water has to make you their daughter
You got what it takes
To make a grown man heart break
Oh, water, water has to make you their daughter
AAWW, you got what it takes
To make a poor man heart break, Aww!
(Water, that water, has to make you their daughter
You got what it takes
To make a poor man heart break.........
