Ha, look here, mm hmm
Strings of my heart, baby
Sing for you

Dear, when you smiled at me (Mm hmm)
I heard a melody (Yeah)
It haunted me from the start
Something inside of me (Mm hmm)
Started a symphony (Honey)
Zing! Went the strings of my heart

Whoa, like a breath of spring
I heard a robin sing, yes I did
About a nest in the park
Ooh, baby, everything seemed to be
In perfect harmony
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Listen to me now

Heh
Lord, have mercy
Hit me, fellas
Heh, it's alright
Sock it to 'em
Mm hmm, honey, honey, it's alright, ooh
It's alright

I still recall that thrill
I guess I always will
I hope we'll never ever part (Never ever part, honey)
Dear, with your lips to mine (Mm hmm)
A rhapsody divine
Zing! Went the strings of my heart
Huh, listen to me now

Ow, it's alright, uh huh, honey
Every day, baby, baby, baby
Sing for you, ow!
It's alright, huh
Mm hmm, honey
Let me sing about my baby
Every day, ow, ow, ow
It's alright, huh
Mm hmm, honey
That's alright, baby
Oh yeah, oh
Early in the morning
Midnight hour, baby
Sing about my baby
Every day, oh
