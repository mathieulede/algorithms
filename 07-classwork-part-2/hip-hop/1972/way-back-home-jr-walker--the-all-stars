Oh, there's good 'n bad things
About the South, boy
Oh, and some leave a bitter taste
In my mouth, now

Yeah!
Like the black man livin' across the track
White man were on the other side
Holdin' him back
Way back home, now

Oh, but we won't talk about that
'Cause it's understood
Ev'rybody sees the bad
But what about the good?

Ooh, I'd give anything
Just to smell that scent
Of honeysuckle growin'
On a backyard fence
Way back home, now

'Oow!'
'Oh heaven scent, ya'all!'

With female chorus

(Way back home)
Yeah, way back home
(Way back home)
Thinkin' on back home

I'd love to smell the wetness
Of grass and trees
And see ground kissed
By honey bees
Like way back home, now

Oh, but childhood days
Are dead 'n gone
Well, but the memories
Still linger on

Oh, have you ever gone swimmin'
In a muddy creek
With nothin' on your body
From head to feet?
Way back home, yeah

How you play for the game
Like hide an seek
Yeah!
And snk through the weeds
Overhear the streams

Well, I know some kids
Still play those games
But when they play
It just ain't the same
Like way back home

'Sad to sing it, ya'all!'

YEAH!
Way back home, way back home

(Way back home)
Way back

Oh, I really miss those things
That have faded away
I remember them
Like it was yesterday
Now, way back home

(Way back ho-ome)
(Way back ho-ome)

FADES:
Doo-doo, do-do
Doo-doo, do-ooo-do

(Way back ho-ome)
(Way back ho-ome)
