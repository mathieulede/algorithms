[Intro]
If you don't know me by now
You will never, never, never know me

[Verse 1]
All the things that we've been through
You should understand me
Like I understand you
Now baby, I know the difference
Between right and wrong
I ain't gonna do nothin'
To upset our happy home
Oh, don't get so excited
When I come home a little late at night
Cause we only act like children
When we argue fuss and fight

[Refrain]
(If you don't know me by now)
If you don't know me by now
(You will never, never, never know me)
You will never, never, never know me
(If you don't know me by now)
If you don't know me, baby
(You will never, never, never know me)
No you won't

[Verse 2]
We've all got our own funny moods
I've got mine, woman you've got yours too
Just trust in me, like I trust in you
As long as we've been together, that should be so easy to do
Just get yourself together
Or we might as well say goodbye
What good is a love affair
When you can't see eye to eye

[Refrain]
(If you don't know me by now)
If you don't, if you don't know me, baby
(You will never, never, never know me)
(If you don't know me by now)
If you don't know me by now
(You will never, never, never know me)
No you won't
(If you don't know me by now)
(You will never, never, never know me)
(If you don't know me by now)
(You will never, never, never know me)
