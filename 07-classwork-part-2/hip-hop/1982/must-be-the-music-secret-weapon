Flashing lights
Moving to the beat
Mirrored walls
And fog at your feet

I'm just a DJ baby
Mixing for you
I will not stop
Until this club night is through

Must be the music
It's turning me on
Must be the music
I cannot go wrong

Must be the music
It's turning me on
Must be the music
I cannot go wrong

My voice is on
So let me MC
I'll spin my records
To get you closer to me

The way you dance
Is blowing my mind
I'm in the booth
Watching you all the time

Must be the music
It's turning me on
Must be the music
I cannot go wrong

Must be the music
It's turning me on
Must be the music
I cannot go wrong

DJs may come
And DJs may go
But I'm the best baby
Don't you know that I would

Give it up
For loving so true
Give up my records
For a moment with you

Must be the music
It's turning me on
Must be the music
I cannot go wrong

Must be the music (now baby)
It's turning me on
Must be the music
I cannot go wrong

Ladies

I'll keep it hot til the daylight
Yes I will
I'll keep you moving all through the night
Oh I will

I'll keep it hot til the daylight
Yes I will
I'll keep you moving all through the night

I'll keep it hot til the daylight
I'll keep you moving all through the night
I'll keep it hot til the daylight
I'll keep you moving all through the night

I said dance, everybody, everybody just clap your hands
I said we're here to do, what we wanna do, for all you rocking fans
