Ooh ooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
I guessed there's no point saying this now
It's done and you're gone, this doesnt count
But now that you've gone away I've realised every day
I made a mistake, You're the best thing I've ever found

But now that I want you, You're moving on
I tried to call you but nobody's home
I didn't know this, till you went away
I'm always a day too late
Oooh ooooh oooh ooooh ooooh always a day too late

I'm done I know, Waiting this long
There's no explanation, For letting you go
And you were right all along
I missed you bad when you're gone
I finally opened my eyes and now I'm standing alone

And now that I want you you're moving on
I tried to call you but nobody's home
I didn't know this, Till you went away
I'm always a day too late
But you ran to me, I didn't want to be bothered, but now I finally see
That you've moved onto another
Now honestly I get the reason why you left
But damn I wish I had you back and...

Now that I want you
You're moving on, I tried to call you
But nobody's home, I didn't know this
Till you went away-y-y
I'm always a day too late

And now that I want you
You're moving on
I tried to call you
But nobody's home
I didn't know this till you went away
I'm always a day too late
Ooh ooh oooh oooh ooh oooh always a day too late
Oooh oooh oooh oooh ooh always a day too late
