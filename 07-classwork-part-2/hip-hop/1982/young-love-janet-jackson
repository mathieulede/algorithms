Young love
Young love
Young love
Young love

[Verse 1:]
I may be young
But I'm not foolish
I can tell real love from a game
I'm not gonna let you use me
Heartbreak playmates
Say it's not the same

[Chorus:]
Young love
(Ring around the roses)
Young love
(Searching for a heart so true)
Young love
(A pocket full of posies)
Young love
(All adds up to me and you)

[Verse 2:]
I traded all my childish treasures
For a burning love so true
It's gonna be my first time around
Heartbreak's high game
Love shake you down

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

(Young love)
(Young love)
(Young love)
(Young love)

[Bridge:]
Young love
(I may be young, but I'm not foolish)
Young love
(I can tell real love from a game)
Young love
(I'm not gonna let you use me)
Young love
(Heartbreak playmates, say it's not the same)

[Repeat Chorus:]

(Young love)
(Young love)
(Young love)
(Young love)

[Repeat Chorus:]

(Young love)
(Young love)
(Young love)
(Young love)

[Repeat Chorus:]
