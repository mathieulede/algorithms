You and me, girl (uh huh)
Go a long way back
And I'm so proud
I'm so proud

You and me, girl
Go a long way back
Yeah, we go a long way back

I remember when
Loving you wasn't easy
It wasn't easy, baby

But I stuck on in there with you
And we made it
Sugar, we made it
Through it all

Now let's keep it up
'Cause I ain't had enough
No, no

You and me, girl
Go a long way back
Such a long, long, long, long way

You and me, girl (yeah, girl)
Go a long way back
Yeah, yeah
We go a long way back

And I know you remember
When trying to love me wasn't easy
It wasn't easy, baby

But you stuck on in there with me
And you see, huh, we made it
Just you and me and we love each other so
Girl, we can't let each other go, no, girl

You and me, girl
Go a long way back
Such a long, long, long, long way
Yeah, girl

You and me, girl
Go a long way back
Yeah, we go a long way back

Ah, ah, ah
You and me, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Oh, just you and me
And we love each other so
Girl, we can't let each other go

You and me, girl
Go a long way back
I wanna thank you, girl
A long way back

We go a long, long, long
Long, long, long, long
Long way

We go a long, long
Long, long, long way
A long way back
