Going round in circles
Circles
Going round in circles

You're taking too much time
To make up your mind
Either you love me or you don't

And all the other girls
In your crazy mixed-up world
You said you'd drop them
But you know you won't

Sometimes I think
About forgetting you
But it's so, so hard
To make that choice

Cause, boy
With you
I go to to seventh heaven
Just by the sound of your voice

Circles
Going round in circles
Circles
Going round in circles

Out of my head
That's where I'm going
Trying so hard to deal with you

It's not so easy trying
To bear these changes
Ooh, boy
That you're putting me through

In my head
There's a ball of confusion
And I can't figure out
Just what to do

I guess my life will keep
On going round and round
Until I get away from you

Circles
(Circles)
Going round in circles
(You've got me so confused)

Circles
(Uh, huh)
Going round in circles
(Can't make up my mind)

Going round in circles
(I don't know what to do)

(I'm going in)
Circles
(Circles)
Going round in circles
Circles
Whoa, oh

Out of my head
That's where I'm going
Trying so hard to deal with you

It's not so easy trying
To bear these changes
Ooh, boy
That you're putting me through

In my head
There's a ball of confusion
And I can't figure out
Just what to do

I guess my life will keep on
Going round and round
Until I get away from you

Circles
(Baby)
Going round in

Going round
Going round, oh

Circles

Sometimes
I think about forgetting you
Circles (circles)
But it's so hard to make that choice
