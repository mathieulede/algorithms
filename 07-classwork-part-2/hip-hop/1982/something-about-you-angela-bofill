Something About You
I saw that look of love in your eyes
I felt the fear close mine
No more romances with broken hearts

For what I swore was a lifetime
I'd rather take care of myself before
My thoughts of getting involved
But when temptation stared me down

All of the complex was solved
You know that
I don't want to fall in love, but
I guess there's something about you, oh, oh

Oh, yeah, there's something about you, mmm
You know there's something about you
And I can't let you go
Oh, my conscience whispers dirty words

Says you've been hungry too long
You've got to feed the heart that's lonely
If you're to make it strong
You know that

I don't want to fall in love, but
I guess there's something about you, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, there's something about you, ooh, oh
You know there's something about you, oh

And I can't let you go, oh, oh, ho
Mmm
Oh
Now that you're here, don't ever leave me

'Cause I committed myself
I've overcome all my doubts and fears
Now I don't want no one else
I guess there's something about you, oh, oh

Oh, yeah, there's something about you
You know there's something about you, oh, oh
Oh, yeah, there's something about you
Something about, something about, something about you, oh, oh

I guess there's something about you
Something about, something about, something about you, oh, oh
I guess there's something about you (Whoa, whoa, whoa, ooh...)
I guess there's something about you

Oh, yeah, there's something about you
I guess there's something about you
Oh, yeah, there's something about you ('bout you)
You know there's something about

I guess there's something about you
Oh, yeah, there's something about you
You know there's something about
