Well
Let me see you do it now
Shake, shake, shake

Do it, do it
Do it, do it

My body screams and hollers
Every time I see you shake
The sexy way that you wiggle
Is more than my heart could take

Watching you shake your body
Makes me wanna get next to it
'Cause I'm curious to know if
The disco floor is the only place
That you can do it

So do it for me, baby
(Shake it on down)
Just do it for me, baby
(Don't stop now)

Do it for me, baby
(Shake it on down)
Just do it for me, baby
(Don't stop now)

Do it, do it
Do it, do it

Ooh, all the fellas talk about you
And we all feel the same
The freaky motion of your body
Is enough to drive a man insane

This urge I got to shake it with you
Is too much to resist

'Cause I'm curious to know if
The disco floor is the only place
That you can twist it

So do it for me, baby
(Shake it on down)
Let me see you shake it
(Don't stop now)

Just do it for me, baby
(Shake it on down)
Come on and shake it
Till you break it
(Don't stop now)

Do it, move it, move it
Shake your body now
Do it, keep it moving
Just do it, move it, move it
Shake your body now
Do it, you can do it

Just do it, move it, move it
Shake your body now
Do it, keep it moving
Just do it, move it, move it
Shake your body now
Do it, you can do it

Let me see you shake

Do it, move it, move it
Shake your body now
Do it, keep it moving
Just do it, move it, move it
Shake your body now
