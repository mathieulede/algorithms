Sittin' here
Couldn't help hear you talkin' to your best friend
Say, you're not satisfied
Things ain't workin' out with your girlfriend
So your searchin' for someone new
Someone to hold you tight, someone to treat you right
Though your girlfriends a friend of mine
Here's my number and a dime, call me anytime

Chorus

Call me - if you need someone to talk to-a
Call me - satisfaction guaranteed
Call me - if you need someone to talk to-a
Call me - call me!

She wasn't good to ya
Was a prude to ya
Don't like to do the things you like to do
She doesn't do to ya
The things she did to ya
Show you lovin' like she used to

Well, I been watchin' you boy
And I've got what you want, got what you need
Though your girlfriends a friend of mine
Here's my number and a dime, call me anytime

(Spoken)

Hello, how ya doin?
No, she's gone
I figured Id give you a call and see if you were serious
I got this little place that I like to go to-a
Its kinda dark and quiet and...

Well, I been watchin' you boy
And I've got what you want, got what you need
And though your girlfriends a friend of mine
Here's my number and a dime, call me anytime
