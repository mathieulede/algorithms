You make me burn with fever
Make me jump and shout
You realy make me lose control
And when you pull my lever
It turns me all about
I feel it way down in my soul

Last night
We turned the power on
Last night
'til the break of dawn (oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh)
Last night
We got into the groove
Last night
We made that move

I could be your puppet
You could pull my string
'cause you make me feel so real
You keep me jumpin'
Keep my whole heart pumpin'
I love the way you make me feel

Last night
We turned the power on
Last night
'til the break of dawn (oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh)
Last night
We got into the groove
Last night
We made that move

I love that way you love me
Last night (yeah)
I said come on, baby, rock me
And never let me go
Last night (uh oh)
I said I love the way you love me
Last night (uh oh)
Come on, baby, rock me
And never let me go
Last night (hmm)
Last night
(ooh yeah)

You make me burn with fever
Make me jump and shout
You really make me lose control
And when you pull my lever
It turns me all about
I feet it way down in my soul

Last night
We turned the power on
Last night
'til the break of dawn (oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh)
Last night
We got into the groove
Last night
We made that move

I love the way you love me
Last night (oh oh oh oh oh)
Come on, baby, rock me
