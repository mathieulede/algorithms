[Verse 1:]
There goes another night time
There goes another dream
When will it be the right time?
It's later than it seems

I used to wait for you
All that has changed so soon
How much can someone love
A someone like you?

[Chorus:]
I really don't need no light
To see through you
I really don't need your love
To see me through, yeah
I really don't need your heart
To set me free
I really don't need the way
It used to be, yeah

[Verse 2:]
And who was that lone arranger?
How did he get to you?
Who were those other strangers?
What did they make you do?

Where was their party from?
You with that number one
How could you feel so high
Just living a lie?

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Now you're so full of schemes
I see right through you like a silver screen
All of your alibis have long gone

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
