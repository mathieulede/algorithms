Had my share of disco nights
Tinsel talk and rainbow lights
Easy smiles that shine like gold
Burnin? hot, then turnin? cold
Led that kinda life before
I lost enough to learn the score
Somethin? tells me that there must be somethin? more
This time I?m holdin? out for love
Made up my mind, I?m holdin? out for love
Mister, this time, I?m holdin? on
Holdin? back, holdin? out for love
Had my fill of party scenes
One night stands and neon dreams
Goodtime friends in fancy clothes
Flashin? highs and crashin? lows
So if that?s what?s on your mind
I?ll just take a pass this time
I believe I?d rather leave it all behind
Oh, this time I?m holdin? out for love
Made up my mind, I?m holdin? out for love
Mister, this time, I?m holdin? on
Holdin? back, holdin? out for love
I need to find someone
Who?ll still be holdin? me
When the dancin?s done
This time I?m holdin? out for love
Made up my mind, I?m holdin? out for love
Mister, this time, I?m holdin? on
Holdin? back, holdin? out for love
Oh, this time, yeah, I?m holdin? out for love
Made up my mind, I?m holdin? out for love
Mister, this time, I?m holdin? on
Holdin? back, holdin? out for love
I?m holdin? out for love
Made up my mind, I?m holdin? out for love
Mister, this time, I?m holdin? on
Holdin? back, holdin? out for love
Oh, this time, I?m holdin? out for love
Made up my mind, I?m holdin? out for love
