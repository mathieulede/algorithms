[Verse 1:]
Here we go
Breaking up what we have built
Leaving out
All the good things that we felt

Where was I
Where was I before you came
Cause from the first time that I saw you
I knew you were made for me

[Chorus:]
So don't throw it all away
Cause I don't want to be the one
Who's gonna have to beg you to stay

And I don't want to be the one
To change your mind
One more time
Please stay
Don't throw it all away

[Verse 2:]
Though it seems
I'm just taking it out on you
Don't you know
You can see through

Found the door
But I couldn't find the key
Cause from the first time
That I saw you
I knew you were made for me

[Repeat Chorus:]
