[Intro]
[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah]
Girl, I got to go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got to go now, really
Yeah, I'm kinda in a hurry
[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah]
Uh-huh, here's the reason why

[Chorus 1]
Jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it

[Verse 1]
My baby loves me
He told me that
And I never question
That point or fact
There is no fighting
Scandal or shame
Uh, he really moves me
Drives me insane

[Chorus 2]
I can't talk to you now, girl, I got love to get
When my baby calls I got jump to it
I'm in a hurry, there's love to get
When my baby calls I jump, jump, jump to it

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
I just can't wait till
Today at four
That's when my sweet thing
Said he would call
Please don't keep me waiting
It's 3:59
Ring-ding, hello, baby
Oh...come please be mine

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]

You know when we talk we have a lot of fun, don't we, girl
Dishing out the dirt on everybody
And giving each other the a11 on who drop kicked who this week
You know what I'm talking about

[Bridge]
When my baby call, shout dee, dee, dee, dee (Jump to it)
