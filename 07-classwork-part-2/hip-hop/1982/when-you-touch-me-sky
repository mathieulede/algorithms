I know that I'm
Supposed to keep my love inside
Don't fall in love with any guy
Until I know the score...

But then you came
Tryin' to take my love away
You wouldn't say if you would stay
But you knew from the start--

When you touch me (when you touch me, yeah)
I love it, yes I love it when you touch me
(Ooh, I love I love what you do to me boy)
When you kiss me (Kiss me baby, baby)
I love it, yes I love it when you kiss me

Ooooooh, yes, I'm in love
And it feels so good
To let you know
Only you can make this feelin' grow
So love me tonight--Ooh

When you touch me (I love I love I love what you do to me boy)
I love it, yes I love it when you touch me
(come a little closer, closer)
When you kiss me (Let me whisper in your ear, I just wanna tell you)
I love it, yes I love it when you kiss me (I never wanna let you go, oh no oh no, oh)

When you touch me
I love it, yes I love it when you touch me
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love with you boy, you boy, just you)
When you kiss me...

(You make all my dreams come true, oh
You're love is so real, and it's so good
Love me tonight, 'cause the time is right
I want you to love me, love me boy...)
When you touch me
I love it, yes I love it when you touch me
(Ooh Baby... touch me here, touch me there, touch me everywhere~~~)
When you touch me
I love it, yes I love it when you touch me...
