Watch out, see us coming
Don't think about running
Watch out, see us coming
Don't think about running
Speak up, stop playing
Who cares what you're saying?
Speak up, stop playing
Who cares what you're saying?
What you're saying?
How does it feel to be floating away?
7th generation today
Fight your own wars and just let us play
Can you take yourself seriously?
Skip the same ol' routine take it off your routine
You think we're joking? Stop testing us
'Cause we're breaking through you're just barking
Who are you comparing? Our ways scaring you?
Watch out, see us coming
Don't think about running
Watch out, see us coming
