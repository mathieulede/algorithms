[Verse 1]
I've been laid off from work
My rent is due
My kids all need
Brand new shoes
So I went to the bank
To see what they could do
They said son looks like bad luck
Gotta hold on you

[Chorus]
Money's too tight to mention
I can't get an unemployment extension
Money's too tight to mention

[Verse 2]
I went to my brother
To see what he could do
He said brother like to help you
But I'm unable to
So I called on my father, father
Oh, my father
He said

[Chorus]
Money's too tight to mention
Oh money, money, money, money
Money's too tight to mention
I can't even qualify for my pension

[Verse 3]
We talk about reaganonics
Oh lord down in the congress
They're passing all kinds of bills
From down capitol hill, we've tried them

[Chorus]
Money's too tight to mention (cut-back!)
Money, money, money, money
Money's too tight to mention
You never hold money

[Verse 3]
We're working nine to five
[?] falling to love
I don't need the love
[?]
I need to [?]
Talking about money
[???]

[Chorus]
Money's too tight to mention
Money's too tight
Oh money,  oh money, oh
Money's too tight to mention
Money's too tight
Too tight to mention
[?]
Money's too tight to mention
Money's too tight
Money's too tight to mention
Money's too tight
Too tight to mention
Money's too tight to mention
Money's too tight
