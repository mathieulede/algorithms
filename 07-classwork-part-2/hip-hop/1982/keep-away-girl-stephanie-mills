Mmm, mmm

Keep away girls
This one's all mine
Keep away girls
This one's all mine

I understand when you look at my man
It's a physical, mmm, attraction
Yeah
Ooh, ooh
Friendship ceases
Desire increases
And you want him back oh, so bad

Oh
I don't think you could fit in my shoes
If we're gonna be friends
Don't you know
Here, here's the best rule

Keep away girls
This one's all mine
You better, better
Keep away girls
This one's all mine

Ooh
Don't get me wrong
I'm not calling no names
But I recognize a woman's game
Yeah
Ooh, ooh

We try to better, clever, witty and wise
Ain't no telling what we'll do or try
Oh
So don't knock on my door
Thinking I'm not at home, yeah
Don't think I'd be dumb enough to leave this man alone
Oh, no

Keep away girls
This one's all mine
You better, better
Keep away girls
This one's all mine

Oh, I know there are things
We have in common
I've been dying to be friends with someone
We can dish the dirt
Shop Bloomingdales'
And hang around to catch the sales
Have tea
The social life is fine in me

We'll be friends forever
Girl scouts too
But hands off my guy
Don't be fool enough to try
I'm warning you
I'm warning you, you, you

Keep away girls
This one's all mine
Ooh
You better, better keep away girls
This one's all mine
(Leave him alone, leave him alone)

Keep away girls
This one's all mine
(Don't come around my door)
Keep away girls (Keep away)
This one's all mine
(I ain't telling you no more)

Keep away girls
(Keep away)
This one's (keep away) all mine
(This one is all mine)
Keep away girls
(Ooh, ooh)
This one's (Ooh, ooh) all mine
(Keep away)

Keep away girls
(This one)
This one's all mine
(I'm telling you now, I'm telling you now)
Keep away girls
(Keep away)
This one's all mine
(This one is all mine)

This one's all mine
(Leave him alone, leave him alone)
This one's all mine
(Oh, leave him alone)

Keep away girls
(Leave him alone)
This one's (Ooh) all mine
(Ah, 'cause he's all mine)
Keep away girls
(Ooh)
This one's all mine
(Hee, hee, heeh, hee, hee)

Keep away girls
(Ooh)
This one's (this one) all mine
(This one is all mine)
Keep away girls (Ooh, ooh)
This one's (this one) all mine
(This one, baby, this one is all mine)
