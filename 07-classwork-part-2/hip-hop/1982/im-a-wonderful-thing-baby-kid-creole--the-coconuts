Hello, open the door
Guess who's gonna ring the chimes
That's right, lend me a paper
You know I've change you right
Oh, girl, make it a quick one
I'm only here tonight
I know, sadder but wiser
I'm still the same old guy
Take a look at me
See, I couldn't look no better
Girl, I'm at my peak
And that's a fact, that's a fact
Take a part of me
You know it couldn't feel no better
Take it all with ease
Before you break your back
Or get a heart attack
I'm a wonderful thing, baby
Such a, such a
(Wonderful)
I'm a wonderful thing, baby
Such a, such a
Goodbye, sorry I can't stay
But I don't have my style
I've got a dozen or more babes
To see before I fly
Hot stuff, beggin' to see me
Why should they really pry?
Come on, give me your blessin'
You're still the first in line
Take a look at me
See, I couldn't look no better
Girl, I'm at my peak
And that's a fact, that's a fact
Take a part of me
You know it couldn't feel no better
Be sure that you breathe
Before you break your back
Or get a heart attack
I'm a wonderful thing, baby
Such a, such a
(Wonderful)
I'm a wonderful thing, baby, baby
(Wonderful)
I'm a wonderful thing, baby
Such a, such a, such a wonderful thing
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
