shine on
with my baby
shine on

When you love somebody
It can really drive you out your mind
When you feel for somebody
And your mind is workin' overtime, baby

Oh, I am strongly attracted to you
I'm tryin' to get my message through
I've finally made up my mind
I think I'll try love one more time

Cause I know what I am feelin' inside
Is a sign comin' straight from my heart
My love that I now send to you, to you
I've got to find a way to you, to you, to you, you

Girl, I'm your lover
And I know I'm bout to blow your mind
But soon you'll discover
That my openness is right on time

When you move your body
Girl, I just ain't got the words to say
What I feel when I touch ya
But I'm just a dreamin' time away

Aw, girl, every word I say is true
If I ever meant a thing to you
Won't you show me that shine in your eyes?
Cause I think I'll try love one more time

I know what I am feeling inside
Is a sign comin' straight from my heart
Won't you smile with me, baby
Shine on

Hey, lovely lady, I've got to get my message to you
Pretty baby, special lady
Hey foxy lady, won't you shine your eyes on me, girl
Shine it, baby,

Hey, lovely lady, I've got to get my message to you
Pretty baby, hey, foxy lady
Won't you shine your eyes on me, girl

Cause I know you want to have some fun, yeah
Shine on, smile with me, baby
Come on shine it like the mornin' sun

Shine on, ooh, with me, baby
Cause I know you want to have some fun, yeah, yeah

Come on shine it, shine it, shine it, ooh
