[Hook]
I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'

[Verse 1]
Everytime you're near
Everytime I see you smile
Hear your "hello"
Saying you can only stay a while

Hey, I know that it's hard for you
To say the things that we both know are true
But tell me how come (I)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Everytime I hear
How you never want to live a lie
How it's gone to far
And you don't have to tell me why

Why you're gone and the game is through
If this is what's real, if this is what's true
Tell me how come (I)

[Hook]

Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that
I know you're not mine anymore-anyway-anytime
But tell me how come (I)

[Hook]
