Kiss you, hug you
Sometimes I can't decide
Confession, expression
Love just having you inside

You got me, I'm blinded
Your love it shines so bright
My days are filled with fantasies
Of lovin' you all night

When I'm near you
There's no place I'd rather be
Everyday my love keeps growing
Baby feel the need in me

Chorus
When I kiss and hold you tight
Keepin' love new
Bring you wine, roses, candlelight
Keepin' love new
Keepin' love new
Keepin' love new
I wanna keep my love
Keppin' love new

Gifts, flowers, to show you're on my mind
Surviving over time
Romance is doing fine

Our friends are married
Can't say for all the tears
So glad we do the things
That keep love strong through all the years

Walk through lands in your eyes
You're my magic mystery tour
In the land of your love
It never rains, it just pours

Chorus
When I kiss and hold you tight
Keepin' love new
Bring you wine, roses, candlelight
Keepin' love new
Keepin' love new
Keepin' love new
I wanna keep my love
Keepin' love new

Keepin' love new
Keepin' love new
I wanna keep my love new

I'm just keepin'
Keepin' love new
I'm just I'm just keepin'
I'm just keepin'
Keepin' love new
I'm just keepin'
Keepin' love new
I'm just I'm just keepin'
I'm just keepin'
Keepin' love new
(repeat)

Repeat Chorus (adlib to fade)
