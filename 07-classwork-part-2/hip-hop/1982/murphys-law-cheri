I hate to tell you, but I got a bit of bad news
I don't love you no more
I see life is like a circle
Everything you do comes back to you

Got it all together, don't cha, baby
Murphy's Law, sure out to get you
Got it all together, don't cha, baby
Murphy's Law, sure out to get you

You know the car
You missed the last payment
The finance company came and towed it away
Towed it away
And the money that you owe to your best friend
You don't owe him no more
'Cause the ring that you bought me for my birthday
I cashed it in at the store

Got it all together, don't cha, baby
Murphy's Law, sure out to get you
Got it all together, don't cha, baby
Murphy's Law, sure out to get you

You know the girl that you've been foolin' around with
She got married today
What happened to your brand new house?
Someone took it away
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!)

Got it all together, don't cha, baby
Murphy's Law, sure out to get you
Got it all together, don't cha, baby
Murphy's Law, sure out to get you

Got it all together, don't cha, baby
Murphy's Law, sure out to get you
Got it all together, don't cha, baby
Murphy's Law, sure out to get you

Hey, what is Murphy's Law?
I dunno
Murphy's Law
I think, well, lemme see
I think whatever could go wrong will go wrong
That means we're in big trouble
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

Murphy's law
Sure out to get you

Got it all together, don't cha, baby
Murphy's Law, sure out to get you
Got it all together, don't cha, baby
Murphy's Law, sure out to get you

Got it all together, don't cha, baby...
