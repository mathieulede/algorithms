I've got your mother's intuition
And our father's intellect
I'm the deep part of you
That you haven't discovered yet

I could be your sister
Or maybe I'm your brother
I could be your best friend
Or I might be your lover

I'm your freaky behavior
Oh, a funky new waver
I'm your freaky behavior
Oh, a funky new waver and watch me

I'm your freaky behavior
Oh, a funky new waver
I'm your freaky behavior
A funky new waver

Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh

I'm the other part of you
The your friends never knew
I'm the bark with the spark
You can cuddle me too

I can be your savior
In your time of need
Or I can keep the favor
And watch you plead

I'm your freaky behavior
A funky new waver
I'm your freaky behavior
Oh, a funky new waver

Yes, I'm your freaky behavior
A funky new waver
I'm your freaky behavior
A funky new waver

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
