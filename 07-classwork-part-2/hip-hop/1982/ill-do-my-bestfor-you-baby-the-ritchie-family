Oh baby, you're a sweet thing
You're the apple of my eye, you're a dream come true
Gonna give you all my loving
'Cause nobody in the whole world
Makes me feel the way you do

I love you so now
And I wanna keep your love
Won't let you go now
You mean the world to me, yeah
Trust in me, baby, I'll never let you down

I'll do my best for you, baby
You've got the love I need
Long as you say that you need me
My love is guaranteed (I'll do my best)
I'll do my best for you, baby
Show you a love so true
Long as you say you'll never leave me
I'll do my best for you (yes, I will)

Boy, your love is such a treasure
As you really give me pleasure when you hold me tight
I pledge all my love forever
You respect me as a lady
And you always treat me right

I'll never hurt you
I don't wanna lose your love
Never desert you
I'll be a fool to leave you
Trust in my loving, I'll never, ever let you down
I'll do my be-est

I'll do my best for you, baby (you've got the love)
You've got the love I need (long as you say)
Long as you say that you need me
My love is guaranteed (I'll do my be-est)
I'll do my best for you, baby (I'll show you love)
Show you a love so true, I'll show you love (yeah, yeah)
Long as you say you'll never leave me (I'll do my be-est)
I'll do my best for you

[Instrumental interlude]
You've got the love

I'll do my best for you, baby (do my best for you, baby)
You've got the love I need, you've got the love
(You've got the love)
Long as you say that you need me (say that you need me)
My love is guaranteed

I love you so now
And I wanna keep your love
Won't let you go now
You mean the world to me, yeah-eah
Trust in me, baby, I'll never let you down, oh, no-o

I'll do my best for you, baby (I'll do my be-est)
You've got the love I need, you've got the love
Long as you say that you need me (say that you need me)
My love is guaranteed (my love is guaranteed)
I'll do my best for you, baby (I'll do my be-est)
Show you a love so true, I'll show you love
Long as you say you'll never leave me
(Baby, keep on lovin' me)
I'll do my best for you (I'll do my best for you)
