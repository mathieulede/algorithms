[Verse 1]
There's a star in the east
Over pyramids at Giza
Where there once lived a girl
She ruled the world
Bend of the Nile
He came with a smile
He was the king
She was the queen

[Pre-Hook]
Under the moonlight
Your eyes won't believe
What your mind can't conceive

[Hook x3]

[Interlude]
Incense & myrrh
Girls that swirl
To the music
Nights over Egypt

[Verse 2]
Women Fellahin
Wear veils to been seen
By no one
Take a caravan
Across the Sudan
Saharan facade
Is just a mirage

Oasis in the sand
Where life once began
Under the moonlight
Your eyes won't believe
What your mind can't conceive

[Hook x4]
