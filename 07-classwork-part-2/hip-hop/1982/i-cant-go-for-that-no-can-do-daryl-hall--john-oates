[Verse 1]
Easy, ready, willing, overtime
Where does it stop
Where do you dare me
To draw the line
You've got the body
Now you want my soul
Don't even think about it
Say, no go

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll do anything
That you want me to do
Yeah, I'll do almost anything
That you want me too, ooh
Yeah

[Chorus]
But I can't go for that, no
No can do
I can't go for that, no
No can do
I can't go for that, no
No can do
I can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that

[Verse 2]
I can go for being twice as nice
I can go for just repeating
The same old lines
Use the body
Now you want my soul
Ooh, forget about it
Now say, no go

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll do anything
That you want me to do
Yeah, I'll do almost anything
That you want me too, ooh
Yeah

[Chorus]
But I can't go for that, no
No can do
I can't go for that, no
No can do
I can't go for that, no
No can do
I can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll do anything
That you want me to do
Yeah, I'll do almost anything
That you want me too, ooh
Yeah

[Chorus]
But I can't go for that, no
No can do
I can't go for that, no
No can do
I can't go for that, no
No can do
I can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that
Can't go for that
