[Verse 1]

Veno Da Don:

If a nigga got a problem we can do somethin'
You ain't no killer you a pussy you won't shoot nothin'
Have my dogs come and get you they gone chew somethin'
He went to jail he got out it's like he knew somethin'

Goldie:

I ah send that bitch to you when I'm through fuckin'
36 bitches that's a few dozen
Cut a stupid hoe off I don't do fussin'
She wake up and eat the dick like a McMuffin

Veno Da Don:

Free my nigga Lil Zero he still in a sentence
And free my Mike out them gates I just made a visit
He told me "watch out for these snakes, they gone end up switching"
And If a nigga ever try me he gone wish he didn't

Goldie:

If ah fuck nigga try me Ima do the sentence
Pull up on a nigga block like pussy what's da issue
R.i.P. my cousin you know I fuckin' miss you
And if I ever see yo killer Ima grab the pistol

Veno Da Don:

In my city it ain't nothing but killers and drug dealers
You gotta bring pumps with ya if niggas don't fuck with you
Came up out the dirt had to work stains on my shirt
Look into my eyes see the pain look at what I'm worth
Niggas act like hoes they ain't tryna pay me for a verse
Then I take they hoes she ain't loyal she a fucking flirt
Lifted up her skirt made her twerk that's a lesson learned
Goldie to me pass her but you know I had to fuck her first

Goldie:

R.I.P. my niggas
Ima see ya when I see ya
Fuck a Bitch but I don't need her
Long dick is what I feed her
Bitch I'm feelin like Michael
I tell them ugly hoes to beat
Never went to fuckin' school
Cause I knew that I ain't need it
Make more money than my teachers
Breakin bread just like I'm Jesus
Ima demon
You ah diva wrist anemic
Neck on freezer
Uh
Hey it's nice to meet ya
Loud pack blow ya speaker
She a feign for the D
She hopin' on just like a feature

[Chorus]

Do somethin', do somethin'
If a nigga talkin' shit, tell em do somethin'
Bitch I a came up from the bottom, had to prove somethin'
Tell em get up out the way, you better move somethin'
Do somethin', do somethin'
If anybody got a problem, we can do somethin'
Do somethin', nigga do somethin'
If niggas want war, we can do somethin'

[Verse 2]

Veno Da Don:

Niggas really think I'm pussy cus I'm light-skinned
But they hoes give me pussy cus I'm light-skinned
I need a bitch super thick to put that pipe in
Beat it up beat it up call me Tyson

Goldie:

I brung the pipe in
We not fightin'
I don't fuck wit these niggas like I'm dikin'
These bitches triflin'
I'm Lil Yatchy one nightin'
Not fuckin wifin'
Uh uh

Veno Da Don:

I treat the Mk like a bustdown
We ain't have shit now a nigga rocking buffs now
Niggas out here hatin' I'm the man when I touchdown
Hoes wasn't goin' guarantee she let me fuck now
They like Veno "why you rappin' like you tough now"
I been bout it I'm just lettin' you know what's up now
I'm too raw to be a pussy you a pussy nigga
Pull up with the sticks yeah I'm hard I let it bust now

Goldie:

Bad bitch
Bust down
She see a young nigga up she wanna fuck now
Actavis in my muthafuckin' cup now
Bitch don't make me bust rounds

Veno Da Don:

Pop shit chop a nigga down with the chop sticks
Mob shit wet a nigga up need a mop bitch
Bye bitch I don't give a damn she ain't my bitch
Stop it niggas get to tweakin' off the toxics

Goldie:

Pull up on yo Muthafuckin' block bitch
With dem chopsticks nigga we gone drop shit
2 bands for a pint of that drop bitch
I'm like fuck a red light I can't stop bitch

Veno Da Don:

Raf Simmons on my feet that's a check bitch
Cough drops smokin' gas for the stress bitch
I don't want no sex bitch I just want the neck bitch
Head shit scratchin' bad hoes off the checklist

Goldie:

So I'm stuck up
You get fucked up
Call and a bitch and I get sucked up
Rollin' good dope in the whip
Pick the guts up
