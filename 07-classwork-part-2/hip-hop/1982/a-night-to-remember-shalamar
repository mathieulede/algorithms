[Verse 1:]
When you love someone
It's natural
Not demanding
And that's one thing
I'm proud to say I found in you

I`m so glad we reached an understanding
Now I know
My heart is safe with you, ooh
So now my love to you, baby
I surrender

[Chorus:]
Get ready tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready
(Oh, baby)
Tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

[Verse 2:]
Celebrations
And my heart could stay united
And there's nothing in this world
To come between me and you

We're together
And it keeps me so excited
To think of
What the power of love can do, ooh
And I`m filled with a love
That`s oh, so tender

[Chorus:]
Get ready
(Baby)
Tonight
(Girl)
I`m gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready
(Get ready)
Tonight
I`m gonna make this a night to remember

Make this a night to remember

Get ready tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready
(Get ready)
Tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready
(Baby)
Tonight
(Darling)
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready
(Darling)
Tonight
(Baby)
Gonna make this a night to remember

This night you won`t forget
Gonna make this a night to remember
‘Cause your love I won`t regret
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready
(Baby)
Tonight
(Darling)
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready
(It won`t be like the past)
Tonight
(I will make it last)
Gonna make this a night to remember

Tonight
Make this a night to remember
Tonight
Make this a night to remember

[Verse 3:]
Let's make a toast
To those who helped make this occasion
They turn their back on love
And that`s what drove you straight to me

Now to you I make a lasting dedication
I'll show you
All that love and life can be, ooh
And each day that I live
I will deliver

[Chorus:]
Get ready
(This night you won`t forget)
Tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready
(‘Cause your love I won`t regret)
Tonight
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready
(Baby)
Tonight
(Darling)
Gonna make this a night to remember

Get ready
(It won`t be like the past)
Tonight
(I will make it last)
Gonna make this a night to remember
Get ready tonight
