Well, the rock still rolls
The beat goes on after all of this time
The faces change but the song's the same
So roll over Mister Dylan for the next in line

They want American music for drivin' with the radio
She said, I know that I would be alright
If I could just make somebody my baby tonight

American music for dancin' with the stereo
Oh do what you like feel what you feel
The music is right
Well, it almost feels real American

From the purple peaks to the city streets
People searching for the rock and roll scene
The power of the pounding beat
The magic in the dream

They want American music for travelin' with the radio
She said, I know that I would be alright
If I could just make somebody my baby tonight

American music for dancin' with the stereo
Oh do what you like feel what you feel
The music is right
Well, it almost feels real American

Just when you think that you've heard enough
Well, somebody say turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up
