[Verse 1:]
Roll back the rug, everybody
Move all the tables and chairs
We're gonna have us a good time tonight

Every time that we meet
We skip and we dip to the beat
Yeah, yeah
What in the world could be better
Than getting together

The last time we had a party
It ended when the sun came up
That's why your mama told you
That you couldn't go out
Stay in the house

[Chorus:]
Bad boy
He's gonna sneak out tonight
He's gonna tip by her window
Cause he sure wants to get out and dance

[Verse 2:]
Everyone's here
Let 'em all in
The chandelier downstairs has fallen
I know it's hard to resist
This is the party no one wanted to miss

But if you don't get home on the double, boy
You're going to be in trouble
I hope your mama don't look in your room
'Cause if she does
She'll be here soon

Boy, she's gonna be mad
You're a bad boy
And you've got it bad, boy
Boy, say goodbye to your friends
'Cause it's gonna be a while
Til you see them again

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Everybody's swinging
Dancing to the music on the radio
Having a party

Everybody's swinging
Dancing to the music on the radio
You can't go

[Repeat Chorus:]
