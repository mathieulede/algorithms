Said a small boy once
Asked:"When will I grow up?"
When will I see what grownups do see?"
And he's bout to come his age
He will act another age
To be reconized is
Quite another mess

And mama used to say:
"Take your time young man"
And mama used to say:
"Don't you rush to get old"
And mama used to say:
"Take it in your stride"
And mama used to say:
"Live your life"

As the years where rushing by
He will cut down on his age
He will tell his girl of how it used to be
How his mommy past away
But this lines she would say
At the time
He couldn't understand

And mama used to say:
"Take your time young man"
And mama used to say:
"Don't you rush to get old"
And mama used to say:
"Take it in your stride"
And mama used to say:
"Live your life"

You"re young son Joe dont hold all back
Do what you want to do
Now is the time for you to strive
For you to get better in what you are doing!

As a small boy once asked
"When will I grow up?"
When will I see what grownups do see?"
At a time to come to come of age
He will act another age
To be reconized is quite another mess!

Hey mama used to say:
"Take your time young man"
And mama used to say:
"Don't you rush to get on"
And mama used to say:
"Take it in your stride
Mama used to say, Hey Hey

And mama used to say:
"Take your time young man"
And mama used to say:
"Don't you rush to get on"
And mama used to say:
"Take it in your stride"
And mama used to say
Mama used to say, Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh
Oh Oh
Oh Oh Oh-wo-oh
