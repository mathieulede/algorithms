I never thought there'd come a time
When someone else could tap my line
On hold my woman's love
I have expecting you to still be mine, yeah

Time comes around, I'm knowing I should be there
'Cause when I call her
A line that's always been clear
Is busy at the strangest hours
Operator got to have your help

This is an emergency
Please interrupt the line
He's trying to beat my time
Emergency, that's what I'm making

Tell her love is on the phone
I know I left her all alone
But this time I got my signals straight
When love calls she won't have to wait

Try the line one more time
This woman is much too rare for me to give her up
Knowing that love's still there
'Cause all at once it came to me
Now operator got to let me please

This is an emergency
Please, won't you put me through?
Or she'll have somebody new
Emergency, that's what I'm making
'Cause my heart is aching

This is an emergency
I don't care about the charge
I'm suffering from a broken heart
Emergency, in the name of love, yeah

So won't you help me out?
This is an emergency
He's trying to beat my time
Emergency, in the name of love, yeah
