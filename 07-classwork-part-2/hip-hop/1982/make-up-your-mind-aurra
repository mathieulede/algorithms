Why don't you make up your mind?
Stop wasting all my time
Why don't you make up your mind?
Stop wasting all my time

Tell me what am I to do
I can tell that's something's wrong when I look at you
You never follow through with words you start to say to me
Your actions are so strange
I wonder what can the problem be

You keep on
(Playing with my feelings)
Yeah, that's what you keep doing, baby
(Playing with my heart)
Ooh, ooh, yeah
You keep confusing me
So that I don't know which way to go, whoa

I've got this feeling that you wanna go
Tell me, baby, is it so?
All I want from you is a little honesty
You always say one thing
Then you do another

So tell me what's on your mind?
Don't you keep me waiting all the time
Tell me what's on your mind
Don't you keep me waiting all the time

Why don't you make up your mind?
Stop wasting all my time
Why don't you make up your mind?
Stop wasting all my time

Baby, things have got to change
I can't keep going on this way
You're driving me insane
You must decide and make it clear to me
Cause I can't take this waiting
I wanna know for sure
You see

You keep on
(Playing with my feelings)
Yeah, that's what you keep doing, baby
(Playing with my heart)
Ooh, ooh, yeah
You keep confusing me
So that I don't know which way to go

Sometimes I feel like I've done something wrong
All I wanna do is satisfy you
Why, baby?
Why you keep mistreating me?
When I'm the only one who really loves you

Why don't you make up your mind?
Stop wasting all my time
Why don't you make up your mind?
Stop wasting all my time
