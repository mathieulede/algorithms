Look what you've done for me-
You're makin' more fun for me
Troubadour me, destined to be
Set in my ways-stuck in my daze

You were the butterfly
Winkin' at me-
Makin' my fires fly
Brought me romance
Taught me to dance-
Makin' me win, makin' me grin
Schoolin' me

CHORUS:
Breakin' away, your love has
Opened eyes that couldn't see
Breakin' away, your beacon in the
The night discovered me

Show me some parachutes
(Away, today, sail away)
As long as I'm here, bring me some
Climbing boots
Open the door, give me some more

Fasten me in-loosen the pin
Pull for me

CHORUS:
Breakin' away, your love has opened
Eyes that couldn't see
Breakin' away, your beacon in the
Night discovered me
