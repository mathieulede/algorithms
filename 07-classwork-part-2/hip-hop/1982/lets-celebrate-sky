Let's celebrate
Loving each other, needing each other
Let's celebrate
Loving each other, needing each other

You got all of my life
You got all of me
And all we need is each other
And that's all we need, all we need

You got me feelin' high
Feel like I'm walking on clouds
Don't ever wanna come down

Let's celebrate
Loving each other, needing each other
Let's celebrate
Loving each other, needing each other

Let's celebrate {We want to celebrate your love}
Loving each other, needing each other
Let's celebrate {We want to celebrate your love}
Loving each other, needing each other

Let's celebrate {We want to celebrate your love}
Loving each other, needing each other
Let's celebrate {We want to celebrate your love}
Loving each other, needing each other

When you talk to me I know that is there
I can feel the need, I know you care
Don't you see, baby, you make me feel so good inside

I wanna celebrate every day that our love lasts
You helped me forget about my past
You might think I'm goin' insane, hey, baby
Just break it the champagne

I wanna celebrate our love, oh, baby
Just you and me
We'll be together, baby
Feel like I'm in love, baby

Come on and celebrate our love

Let's celebrate
Loving each other, needing each other
Let's celebrate

Let's celebrate (Feel like I'm walking on clouds)
Loving each other, needing each other (Don't wanna, wanna come
Down)
Let's celebrate (Love is in the air, love's everywhere)
Loving each other, needing each other

Let's celebrate {We want to celebrate your love}
Loving each other, needing each other (Let's celebrate our
Love)
Let's celebrate {We want to celebrate your love}
Loving each other, needing each other

Let's celebrate {We want to celebrate your love}
