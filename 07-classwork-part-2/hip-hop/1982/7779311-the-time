[Verse 1]
Baby, what's your phone number?
I know I'm kinda fast, but I hate to waste time
Baby, what's your phone number?
Girl, I have to ask 'cause you're so fine

[Chorus]
777-9311
I wanna spend the night with you if that's alright
777-9311
Ooh baby, please can I come tonight?

[Verse 2]
Baby, what's your phone number?
How can you be reached on a lonely night?
Baby, what's your phone number?
How can I get into you when I'm feeling right?

[Chorus]
777-9311
I wanna spend the night with you if that's alright
777-9311
Ooh baby, please can I come tonight?

Ain't nothin' worse than rejection?
I'd feel a little better if you'd slapped my face

Hey, what's your phone number?
Can't you see the agony I'm goin' through?
Baby, what's your phone number?
Girl, it's getting hard baby, won't you let me love you?

[Chorus]
777-9311
I wanna spend the night with you if that's alright
777-9311
Ooh baby, please can I come tonight?

Hey baby,what's your phone number?
I know it sounds fast, but I ain't got all night
Come on baby, what's your phone number?
You know I got to be cooler than this cat you're sittin' with
I'll do you right, baby. Come on!

[Chorus]
777-9311
I wanna spend the night with you if that's alright
777-9311
Ooh baby, please can I come tonight?

Come to night, if it's alright
Honey, please can I come to night?
Can't you see what I'm gonna do?
I wanna do it to night, baby. I wanna do it to you

It's on fire, you burn me out
It's getting higher, you know what I'm talkin' about
Help me out good Lord above
Marry me girl, give me some of that love
