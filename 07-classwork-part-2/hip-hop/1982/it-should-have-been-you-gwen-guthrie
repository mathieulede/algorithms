It should have been you
Could have been you
It should have been you
Could have been you

When we first got together
We thought our love would stand the test
Waiting, oh, so long

Can't settle for second best
No one else could make me feel the way you do
Broke me heart in two
When you said your love was through

It should have been you
Could have been you
It should have been you
Could have been you

Through pain, tears and heartache
We see our love can't last
It's time for new beginnings
Can't live in the past

With my back to the wind
I face a new horizon
Believe me when I say that it's true
Even though our love is through

Been searchin' such a long time
True love's so hard to find
Been searchin' such a long time
True love's so hard to find

No one else could make me feel
The way you do
Broke me heart in two
When you said your love was through

It should have been you
Could have been you
It should have been you
Could have been you

Been searchin' such a long time
Wonder when I'll ever find
A man so warm and true
Who loves me like you used to do
