Baby i need your loving
Baby i need your loving
Although you're never near
Your voice i often hear
Another day, another night
I long to hold you tight
'cause i'm so lonely
Baby, i need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, i need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to cry
Then weak i'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep
'cause lately i've been losin' sleep
Baby, i need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, i need your loving
Got to have all your loving
I love you
I need you
I love you
I need you and i want you, baby
I love you and i want you, baby
I need you and i want you, baby
I love you and i want you, baby
I need you and i want you, baby
When you see me smiling
You know
Things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed
Darlin', i can't go on without you
This emptiness inside me won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me darlin'
Makes me feel not alive, oh baby
Baby, i need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, i need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, i need your loving
Got to have all your loving
Baby, i need your loving
Got to have all your loving
