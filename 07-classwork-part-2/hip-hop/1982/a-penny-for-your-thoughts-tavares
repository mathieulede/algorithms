I've got to know where I stand
I just got to know where I am with you

So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Walkin' holdin' hands, you say you're mine all mine
Then soon another face steals your eyes away
It's just a guessing game and I can't help feelin' used
Love shouldn't be so darn confused

So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

People love to talk, they say you're usin' me
Though face to face you swear I'm the only one
If I had a crystal ball I would gaze into your mind
See what you were thinkin', if my ship was sinkin'
If you're leavin' me behind

So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Girl, it should be so darn easy to do
If you love me like I love you

Girl, if I had a crystal ball [A crystal ball] I would gaze into your mind
See what you were thinkin', if my ship was sinkin'
If you're leavin' me behind

So here's penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me
Penny for your thoughts, a nickel for a kiss
A dime if you tell me that you love me

Girl, it should be so darn easy to do
If you love me like I love you
