You've got me like no one has before
I really love you
The way you talk and the things you say
Sound so good
But there you were standing over there
With another last night
Now I'm in the middle of it
Can't you see it's killing me

I had high hopes for you and me
Thought we'd stay together eternally
High hopes for our love
Felt like it was heaven sent from above

Ooh-ooh...
Just too hard to let go

You told me you loved nobody else
You never would
You've had my child
You'd even marry me if I asked
But now it seems more so every day
That you need me less
Now you're almost there, come around
I don't wanna let you go, oh-ho

I had high hopes for you and me
Thought we'd stay together eternally
High hopes for our love
Felt like it was heaven sent from above

(High hopes)
This can't be
Caught you with another
And, girl, it's killing me
(High hopes)
You let me down
I have to find somebody else
Since you won't be around

Just need a little time
It'll be alright

High hopes
High hopes

Can't you see, I want you for myself
(And always will)
We had our talk and tried to make things right
Or so it seems
But now it's him for you
I guess you won't need me anymore
Hey, I never ever come around
To see you again, oh-ho

'Cause I had high hopes for you and me
Thought we'd stay together eternally
High hopes for our love
Felt like it was heaven sent from above

(High hopes)
Ooh, this can't be
Caught you with another
And, girl, it's killing me
(High hopes)
You let me down
I have to find somebody else
Since you won't be around

High hopes
Just need a little time
And I'll be alright
High hopes
Ooh-hoo, high, high, high

High hopes
It's so hard to let go
High hopes
