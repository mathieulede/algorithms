I called a friend
I called to ask her 'bout you
And I found out
You're looking for someone new

Romance is great
I wish you'd call me for a date
Make a move
It's not too late
If what I heard is really true
I wanna get next to you

I'm waiting by the hotline, baby
Call and tell me that you'll be mine
I'm waiting by the hotline, sugar
Call and tell me that you'll be mine

I had my dreams
And my dream man has a style, baby
My dreams came true
The first time that you smiled, sugar

You seem to be everything I want for me
But can you love unselfishly
If what I feel is really true
I wanna get close to you

I'm waiting by the hotline, baby
Call and tell me that you'll be mine
I'm waiting by the hotline, baby
Call and tell me that you'll be mine

I'm waiting by the hotline, baby
Call and tell me that you'll be mine
I'm waiting by the hotline, sugar
Call and tell me that you'll be mine
