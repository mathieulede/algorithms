Attack of the name game

I was walkin' down the street
Keepin' time with my feet
When I heard the strangest sound
I saw a spaceship scene and a man in green
And a crowd was gathered 'round

Well, I stepped up close
Just to get a little dose
Of his rhymin' kind of game
Then he winked all three of eyes at me
And he said, "Did you catch my name"

It's Clack it back

I gotta Clee Cly Cloe the Clack a jack

Turn the Tyde
You gotta move the Myde
You gotta wham-bam funkify the Fyde

Your rap is truly meaner
Now try some more"
He said, "For sure. Come on, let do Tina"

I couldn't believe what he was sayin' to me
This dude sure came on hip
(Hey, mama)
His threads were fine and electric lime
Was the color of his ship
(Check it out)

And the rhymin' sounds that cat threw down
Were surely from above
And I said, "Why'd you come here Clyde"
And he said, "To spread some love"
