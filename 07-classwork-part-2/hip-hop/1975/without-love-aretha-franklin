All night long, one night, I could not sleep for ringi-ing-ging in my ear;
A melody began to sing...
For at first, the words I could not make out clear
Then smog fields lifted away (smog fields), and this is what I heard them say...

It said, "Without love (without love), there's nothing you can do..." Yes, it did!
It said, "Without love (without love), you're not even you..."

All night long, He spoke to me - the words of wisdom rang
Beneath His sweet, soft melody...
Said, "Don't you know (Don't you know), yeah (child?), that a rich man can be poor
If wealth is all he has?" (Mm, mm, mm.) Hey! I know...

Yeah, without love (without love), there's nothing you can do... (Do, do, do!) Do you know?
Without love (without love), you're not even you...
Can't you hear me talking to you? (Can't you hear us talking to you?)

Without love, ha, there's so much you can do... (Without love...) Yes, it is!
Hey, without love (without love) - ooh! - you're not even you... (Ooh, ooh, ooh...)

Oh, yeah!
Without love (without love), there's really so much you can do... (Without love...) Yes, it is! (Without love...)
Without love (without love), you're not even you...

Without love (without love), there's so much you can do... (Without love...) Yes, it is, yes, it is! (Without love...)
Without love (without love), you're not even you...

Sing it, sing it, one more time...
Without love (without love), there's so much you can do... (Without love...) Without love... (Without love...)
(Without love,) do you know you're not even you?

Hey, hey! Without love (without love), just so much you can do...
