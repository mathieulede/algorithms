Just wait a minute, honey
I've got some rap for you

You know you been running
All over town with my man
Telling my friends about
You gonna take my man away from me

But you see
If I can't hold him
Ha, I don't need him
Let me tell you something

I don't care where he goes
Or if he's been with you
Or what he does while he's gone
Or who he's doing it to

I don't mind him having
A little fun with you, honey
Because I know I'm the girl
That's spending his money

I don't feel like, ooh
My man doing me wrong now
Just as long as he takes care of home
(Taking care of business)
He's doing all right
(Taking care of home)

I don't mind him getting
A little loving from you
No, I don't (I don't mind it)

If I were a man, ooh
I'd get some too
(Get me some, get me some too)

I know my man has been giving
Some love away (I don't mind)
(I don't mind, I don't mind)
But how much love do you think
I can lose in one day
(Lose in one day)

I don't feel like, ooh
My man been doing me wrong, no
Just as long as he takes care of home
(Taking care of business)
Sure enough know how
(Taking care of home)

I know my man is fooling around
With other girls, yes, I do
But understanding is the best thing
In the world (ooh, yeah) yeah

You might think that you're pulling
A fast one on me (shut your mouth)
But you're just getting the bone
While I'm getting the meat
(What you say)

I don't feel like my man
Is doing me wrong, no
Just as long as he takes care of home
(Taking care of business)
He's doing all right
(Taking care of home)

He's taking care of business
(Ooh, yeah)
He's doing his homework
(Taking care of homework) yeah

He knows how to move me
(Ooh, yeah) yeah
He knows how to groove me
(Knows how to rock me)

Oh, baby (ooh, yeah)
He knows how to take care of home
(Taking care of home)
