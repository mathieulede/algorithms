Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side
I know you got a chick on the side

Verse 1
I know you want us both and I know the reason why
I can give you so much lovin
But presents, she can buy you
Last night you're in my arms
Tonight I'm all alone

Chorus
How long will this game go on? How long?
Oh, oh how long?

Betcha got a chick on the side, sure you got a chick
I know you got a chick on the side

Verse 2
And it's plain, plain enough to see that
You're not the man for me
I can't keep playin games that keep my heart in pain
I want to turn and walk away but it's harder to do
Than it is to say

Chorus

Verse 3
It might hurt me for awhile but of one thing I am sure
I'll get over you, yes I'll find someone new
Each time I open up my heart
It seems to just get torn apart

Adlib line 1
I saw you, don't you try to hide
Don't hide it from me, no, no. no

Adlib line 2
You thought you would hide it, hide it
Hide it from me
Repeat...
