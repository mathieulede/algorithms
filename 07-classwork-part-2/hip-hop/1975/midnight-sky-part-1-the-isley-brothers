Midnight Sky the moon is a quarter
Layin' low and south of the border
I know that when I awaken
I've taken more than moon beams home in a jar
Oh baby, mornin' and there you are right next to me
Can you feel it

Break of day and I'm feelin' hazy
And she's feelin' good
Milky Way is all in my mind
I have no sense of direction when
Loving you
I lose conception of time
Under the midnight sky baby get next to me
Can you feel it

The greatest pleasure too great no measure
After the day is done
An invitation to find temptation
Under the midnight sun

Under a midnight sky, baby...get next to me
