Sitting here together, baby, we're all alone
Now I can tell ya, girl, you turn me on
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high

Bring out the loving, loving desire, baby
You got the match, oh that lights the fire
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high

Mama, mama, mama, mama
Mama, mama, mama, mama
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high
I get lifted up hi-high, hi-high

Mama, mama, mama, mama
Mama, mama, mama, mama

Sitting on the corner, waiting for your love light
