I put a song in your heart, so you say
Sing it out, let the world know what it's all about
If I make it possible for the impossible
To happen for you like you say, hey

Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's the same thing you do for me
Baby, that's backatcha
Oh, baby, that's tit for tat
I'm givin' you this for that

You're flyin' high with your head in the clouds
Trouble comes along to bust your bubble
It's not incredible when I make it credible
Things seem much better for you

Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's the same thing you do for me
Baby, that's backatcha
Oh, baby, that's tit for tat
I'm givin' you this for that

Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's backatcha

Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's backatcha

[Incomprehensible] and so, oh, baby, yeah
What it is exactly, you don't know what it is
So when you feel it, don't try to conceal it, no
Just let it happen for you

Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's backatcha
Baby, that's backatcha
