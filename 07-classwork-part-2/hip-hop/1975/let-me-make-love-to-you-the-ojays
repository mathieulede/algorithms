Just, just, just, just
Let me make love to you, baby

I won't hurt, I won't hurt
I'll treat you ever so gentle
I'll make every little thing alright
Honey, you'll never forget this night

Just let me make love to you, baby
I'll be good, I'll be better then better
Neater than neater
Sweeter than sweeter

I promise I'll do anything
You want me to do
Everything a man in love would do

When the morning comes
Puts the night on the run
Cause we've only, we've only
Begun to laugh, begun to love
Baby, baby

Just let me make love to you, baby
I won't stop, I won't stop
Til you ask me to
Tell me to, beg me to

Oh, baby, I'm counting on you
Darling, to make this wish come true
I tell you, I'm counting on you
I'm counting on you
To make all my dreams and wishes

Just let me make love to you, baby
I won't stop, I won't stop
Til you ask me to
Tell me to, beg me to

Oh, baby, I'm counting on you
To make this wish come true
Thank you for using
If you just let me
Make love to you, baby
To you, I won't hurt
I won't hurt, baby, no
I'll treat you ever so gentle......
