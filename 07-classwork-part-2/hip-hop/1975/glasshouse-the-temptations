Nyah Ha, Ah Ha, Ah Ha Yeah Nah Nah

If you're living in a glasshouse (Watch out, watch out)
Don't throw no stones (Watch out, watch out)

If you're living in a glasshouse (Watch out, watch out)
Don't throw no stones

Who, Whoo whoo whooo, Whoo whooo whooo

We're all made with 3 plays apiece...
We're born alone, and we die alone
Why can't we live in-between?

I don't care what goes on in your house when you close your door
If you quit lookin' in my bedroom window, I'll quit lookin' in yours

My Girl came home and she caught me with Alice
And she threw me out the door, nah, nah, nah

But the real reason that she was so mad
Was that she was with Alice before (Say what?!)
(See there? People always doin' that)

If you're living in a glasshouse (Yeah, y'all)
Don'tcha throw no stones (It's a shame)

If you're living in a glasshouse (Whoa, whoa)
Don'tcha throw no stones

Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Wooo, ewwww
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Wooo, ewwww
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh, I ain't no fool

Who, Whoo whoo whooo, Whoo whooo whooo
