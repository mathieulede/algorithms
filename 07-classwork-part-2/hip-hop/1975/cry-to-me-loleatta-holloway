"baby, i see you packing
But it's no surprise for me
You see, i knew it was coming for a long time
Say what ? no, no i won't cry
You see i'm a big girl now, and i just can't cry no more
But there's something i want you to know:
That i love you, i love you, i love you !
And there's one more thing i want you to know:
That if you ever need a friend
You can count on me
And honey:"
If you're falling down
And you can't seem to stay on the ground
And when friends get few
I'll be there to get you up
And if she puts you down
I'll be around, so don't be afraid
Cause i'll be there to get you up
And if it steal the smiles, rain and shine
If you're sad or glad, happy or bad
You can cry to me (cry to me)
Cry to me (cry to me)
No matter how harder things got to be
You can cry to me
Cry cry cry cry to me

But i can't help myself really comes to loving you baby
And i know you said
That our love was true
