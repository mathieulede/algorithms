I been trying to get to you for a long time
'Cause constantly you been on my mind
I was thinkin' about a short cut I could take
But it seems like I made a mistake

Well, I was wrong
Ooo, took too long
I got caught in the rush hour
An' fellows started to shower
You with love and affection
Now you won't look at my direction
On the expressway to your heart
That expressway's not the best way

At five o'clock
It's much too crowded. (Too crowded.)
No, it's much too crowded. (Too crowded.)
So-oh crowded. (Too crowded.)
It's much too crowded, oh yeah. (Crowded.)
So, so, so crowded. (Ohhh, too crowded.)

A-There's too many ahead of me
They all try to get in front of me
I thought that I could drive a clear road ahead
But I found stoplights instead

I was wrong
Babe, it took too long
I got caught in the rush hour
An' fellows started to shower
You with love and affection
C'mon look at my direction
On the expressway to your heart
That expressway's not the best way

At five o'clock
It's much too crowded. (Too crowded.)
Much too crowded. (Too crowded.)
So-oh crowded. (Too crowded.)
So move me, oh yeah. (Crowded.)
[Fade.]
Ohhh, so crowded...
