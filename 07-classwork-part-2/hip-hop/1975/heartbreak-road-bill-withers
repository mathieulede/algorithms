Wonder who is waiting for me
At the end of Heartbreak Road
Hope that she'll be tender
Someone I can know

Heartaches just don't last forever
But it's a lonely road
A road we all must travel
Once before we go

I believe that love's a good teacher
When you're in it
And even if it don't work out
You ain't gone never understand it
â€˜Til you're all down in it
And find out what it's all about
But that's all right because

Heartaches just don't last forever
But it's a lonely road
A road we all must travel
Once before we go
