[Verse 1]
Two people, just meeting
Barely touching each other
Two spirits, greeting
Trying to carry it further
You are one, and I am another
We should be one, inside each other

[Hook]
You can see inside me
Will you come inside me?
Do you wanna ride inside my love?

[Verse 2]
Two strangers, not strangers
Only lacking the knowing
So willing, feeling
Infinite growing
While we're here, the whole world is turning
We should be one, fulfilling our yearning

[Hook]
