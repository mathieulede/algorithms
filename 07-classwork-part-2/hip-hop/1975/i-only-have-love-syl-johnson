[Verse 1]
I know we've only been friends it's true
And I've always been fond of you
But strange thangs are starting to occur
Thangs are changing, from what they were
With each passing, day I find
You becoming more part of my mind

[Hook]
Could I be, falling in love with you
Could I be, falling in love with you
Could I be, falling in love with you, baby
Could I be, falling in love with you

[Verse 2]
Casual embraces, we used to give
Now somehow praying a trace of thrill
Those friendly smiles, we cast before
Now have a taste of little bit more
Whatever this thang that's bothering me
It's making me look at you so differently
There's something about the situation
That overpowers my imagination

[Hook]
Could I be, falling in love with you
Could I be, falling in love with you
Could I be, falling in love with you, baby
Could I be, falling in love with you
Could I be, falling in love with you
Could I be, falling in love with you
Could I be, falling in love with you, baby
Could I be, falling in love with you
