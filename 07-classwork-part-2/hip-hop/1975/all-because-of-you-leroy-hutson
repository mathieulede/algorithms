Wantin' and needing
We can make it through some
Things you've done

Girl, I want ya
And I need ya
And I'll do anything
Don't think I won't

It gives me so much joy to
Wake up in the morning
Find you by my side

Want to do all that's
In my power
Keepin' you happy
By the Hour
Not being satisfied

I love ya and I need ya
Woman, I want you through
With me always (I love you and I want you here)

Said, I need ya near me
You are the one that
Brightens all my days (all of my days, yeah)

Whenever were together
I m just filled with
So much love

Oh, baby

Darling, I know this love of mine
Can withstand the test of time
I ain't goin'nowhere - don't you dare!

Girl, I love you and I need you
I'll always give you love so tenderly

Say I need ya
Near me
I want to hold
You, oh, so close to me

Whooo! Hooo!

(Music interlude)

Baby, I'ts all because of you
That I can do the things I do
You give me such motivation
Such a beautiful relation
And I'ts because of you

I love you and need ya
I always want you
Here with me always

Said, I need ya near me
You are the one that
Brightens all my days

(Music interlude)
