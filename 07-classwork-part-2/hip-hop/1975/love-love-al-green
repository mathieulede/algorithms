How Should I Your True Love Know
HOW SHOULD I YOUR TRUE LOVE KNOW

How should I your true love know
From another one?
By his cockle hat and staff
And his sandal shoon

He is dead and gone, lady
He is dead and gone;
At his head a grass-green turf
At his heels a stone

White his shroud as the mountain snow
Larded with sweet flowers
Which bewept to the grave did not go
With true-love showers

Note: The forst of Shakespeare's Ophelia's "Mad Songs", Hamlet
Act IV Scene 5
