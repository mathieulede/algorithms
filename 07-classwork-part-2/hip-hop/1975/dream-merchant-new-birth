Hey, hey, Mr. Dream Merchant
Everything depends on you, oh yeah
Hey, hey, Mr. Dream Merchant
Bring her back to me and make my dreams come true

Baby, when I said good-bye to my love
I didn't mean to make her cry
I didn't realize of our love
Now I need her by my side

Hey, hey, Mr. Dream Merchant
Everything depends on you, oh yeah
Hey, hey, Mr. Dream Merchant
Bring her back to me and make my dreams come true

You should have told this fool to stop it
You should have made this blind man see
I've got my pride back into my pocket
Oh, won't you bring her back to me

Hey, hey, Mr. Dream Merchant
Everything depends on you, oh yeah
Hey, hey, Mr. Dream Merchant
Bring her back to me and make my dreams come true

Baby, baby, baby, yeah
Hey, hey, Mr. Dream Merchant
Everything depends on you, oh yeah
Hey, hey, Mr. Dream Merchant
Bring her back to me and make my dreams come true

Make 'em come true, yeah, yeah, oh Lord, yeah, yeah
Mr.Dream Merchant, would you please, please do me a favor?
If you, you should happen to see my baby somewhere
Would you please tell I'm waiting with open arms
Would you please make my dreams come true?

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Please, please, please, please

Mr. Dream Merchant
Everything, everything, everything is on you, oh
Bring her back now, now, now, now, now, now
I need her, I need her, I need her, yeah yeah yeah yeah
