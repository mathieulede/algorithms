I promise to love you no matter what you do
I want you, I need you
I love you through and through
I promise, promise to be true

I promise to remember the meaning of romance
If I've done something wrong
Give me one more chance
I promise, promise to be true

My darling, I have promised to give you my heart
Oh darling, promise me we will never part
I know I'm not a king and I'm not very wise
But one thing you must realize

I promise to remember the meaning of romance
If I've done something wrong
Give me one more chance
I promise, promise to be true

My darling, I have promised to give you my heart
Oh darling, promise me we will never part
I know I'm not a king and I'm not very wise
But one thing you must realize

I promise to remember the meaning of romance
If I've done something wrong
Give me one more chance
I promise, promise to be true
