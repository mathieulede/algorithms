Don't be afraid
To pleasure yourself
Can't you remember
How good it felt?

Cravin' for love
Is a natural desire
Don't fight the feelin'
And let me take you higher

A love don't dare (care????)
Has made you grieve
But this love of mine
Can bring relief

Come get the cream off the top
Come get the best that I got
And I'll belong to you

Come get the cream off the top
Come get the best that I got
And I'll belong to you

I'm willin' to give you
More than I take
If it takes all night
I'm willin' to make...

Make good love to you
And bring you pleasure
The kind of love
That you can treasure

You've spoken of love
I know you've tasted it
But without the rest of it
Life can be wasted

Ahhh, take it baby
Take it baby
Come take all that I got

Ahhh, take it baby
Take it baby
You can have all I got

A mouth full of love
Is all you've tasted
Without the rest of it
Life can be wasted

Ahhh, take it baby
Take it baby
Come get all that I got

Take it baby
Ahhh, take it baby
You can have all I got

Come get the cream off the top
Come get the best that I got
And I'll belong to you

Come get the cream off the top
Come get the best that I got
And your dreams'll come true...
