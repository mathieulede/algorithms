Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
Oh my baby, oh baby

As I stand by your flame
I get burned once again
Feelin' low down, I'm blue

As I sit by the fire
Of your warm sexy sweet desire
I've got the blues for you, for you

Every night you've been away
I've sat down and I have prayed
That you're safe in the arms of a guy

Who will bring you alive, I hope will bring you alive
Someone who won't drag you down
Someone who won't misuse you, accuse you, abuse you, oh baby

In the satin sheets of time
I hope I'll find true peace of mind
Love is a bed, love is a bed full of blues, blues

And I've got the blues for you, I won't tell you
I, I've got the blues, the blues for you, babe
Look what you doin' to me, babe

I've got the blues all night with you, baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
I come on form a half, I don't which way to turn, I don't which way to go
I can't watch TV, I can't watch the late show
'Cause I, I've got the blues, late night blues for you, babe

Cry myself here in the morning, cry, baby
You somewhere watching The Rolling Stones
I here waiting here waiting in this bed of blues all alone

Singing a song to you, singing a song to you
Singing a song to you, you, you, you
Singing a song to you, oh
