Baby, they're at it again
I can't even go outside
To hang up clothes
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
Or go to the grocery store

Unless I see some of them
Out there pointing
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
Yeah, there she is, that's her
There's who

I ain't bothering nobody
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
I ain't done nothing
I wish they'd mind their own business
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)

Yeah, I know you know
But I wish they'd stop talking
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
Yeah, I guess life is funny that way

Yeah, I understand that
People are people and all
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
But I just wonder why people
(Everybody's talking 'bout me)
Don't understand that I'm me

Mmm hmm, living together
Perfectly happy, yeah
My man and me

Mmm hmm, people call me dirty
If true love is dirty
Then throw some water on me

Guess it would be all right
If we were married
And we wasn't in love
Like the girl who lives next door
Feel sorry for her

She got papers on her man
That she hardly ever sees
I ain't got no papers on no man
But I got a man here with me

I'm talking about
Shackin' up, shackin' up
We're in love with each other
If we ever want our freedom
We don't have to pay to be free

What's wrong with
Shackin' up, shackin' up
We're perfectly happy
I only wish that people
Would just let us be

Yeah, mmm hmm
Why don't they leave us alone

Guess it would be all right
If we were married
And we wasn't in love
Like the girl who lives next door
Feel sorry for her

She got papers on her man
That she hardly ever sees
Thank you for using
I ain't got no papers on no man
But I got a man here with me

Shackin' up, shackin' up
We're in love with each other
If we ever want our freedom
We don't have to pay to be free

What's wrong with
Shackin' up, shackin' up
It's better than being like
My next door neighboor
She's paying within

What's wrong with
Shackin' up, shackin' up
It's been good to me
I might not be married
But I'm never lonely

What's wrong with
Shackin' up, shackin' up
We're in love with each other
It's getting better and better
