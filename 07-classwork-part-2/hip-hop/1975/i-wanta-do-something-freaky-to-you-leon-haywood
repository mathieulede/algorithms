I wanta do something freaky to you
Baby
Oh, baby
I wanta do something freaky to you
Right now
Oh, baby

Your love looks like a mountain
And I'd love to slide down into your canyon
In the valley of love
I won't rest (I won't rest) until I bring joy and happiness
I wanta do something freaky to you
Baby
Oh, baby
I wanta do something freaky to you
Right now
Oh, baby
All prepostitons of the Zodiac signs
I won't quit until I blow your mind
Compatible or not I'll hit the spot
In the name of love with everything I got, oh

I wanta do something freaky to you
Baby
Oh, baby
I wanta do something freaky to you
Right now
Oh, baby

I don't wanna spoil your image of me
But my style of love is totally free
I'll put it where you want it
As long as you need it
I'll make it good and I won't mistreat it

I wanta do something freaky to you
Baby
Oh, baby
I wanta do something freaky to you
Right now
Oh, baby

Get a little freakish baby
Get a little freakish, baby
Get a little freakish, baby
Get a little freakish, baby
All prepositions of the Zodiac signs
I won't quit, no
Until I blow your mind
I'm compatible as ever
Oh, I'll hit the spot
Oh, in the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
In the name of love
