(Do, do, do, do, do, do-do-do-do)
(Do, (doop, doop) do, do, do, do)
(Do, do, do, do, do, do-do-do-do)
(Do-do-do-do...)
I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
I'm picked to click now
I'm a son-of-a-gun
So hold it right there little girl, little girl
We're gonna have big fun
I may be an oldie, but I'm a goodie, too
I'll last forever and I'll be good to you
Oh, yes I will
(Do, do, do, do, do...)
I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
I'm a super-soul sure-shot, yeah
I'm a national breakout
So let me check your playlist, mama
Huh, c'mon let's make out
I'm high on the chart
I'm tip for the top
But till I'm in your heart
I ain't never gonna stop
Never, never baby
We got a smash double-header
If we only stay together
Talkin' 'bout you
Talkin' 'bout me
(Do, do, do, do, do...)
I'm eighteen with a bullet
Got my finger on the trigger, I'm gonna pull it
Yes I will
Be my A-side, baby, be beside me
Right now, right now I'm a single
But pretty soon you'll see
We'll have a hit first time
And won't be long we'll find
That we're raising a whole L.P
Woo-hoo
You know I'm eighteen, woo-hoo, with a bullet
Yes I am, baby
I got my finger right there on the trigger
I'm gonna pull it, pull it, pull it
You better start makin' plans, baby
This old house is too small, now, now, now
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
(Shoop shoop shoop shoop, be doo be doo doo...)
