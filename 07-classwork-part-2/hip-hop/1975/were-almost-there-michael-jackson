[Verse 1]
No matter how hard
The task may seem
Do not give up our plans
Do not give up our dreams

No broken bridges
Can turn us around
Because what we are searching for
Will soon be found

[Chorus]
Because we are almost there
Just one more step
(Because we are almost there)
Just one more step
(Just one more step)
Do not give up
Because we are almost all there
(Because we are almost there)

[Verse 2]
(Look at the lovers)
Look at the lonely lovers
That did not make it
Life is a long hard climb
(Life is a long hard climb)
They just could not take it
(They just could not take it)

Do not let it happen to me and you
Hold on together, darling
We will make it through

Darling, keep on reaching out for me
Keep on reaching, do it for me
Do it for me, cause baby

[Chorus]
(Because we are almost there)
(We are almost there)
(Because we are almost there)

[Verse 3]
We are so close
I can taste it
A life so sweet
Cannot afford to waste it
(Cannot afford to waste it)

[Verse 4]
Need to feel your hand
Slipping from mine?
Just hold on tight now, darling
Keep on trying

[Verse 5]
Baby, do it for me, do it do it baby
(Because we are almost there)
Just one more step
(We are almost there)
Do not give up
(Because we are almost there)
Just one more step

[Chorus]
Baby baby, do not give up
(Because we are almost there)
Keep on, keep on
(We are almost there)
Just one more step
(Because we are almost there)
Because we are almost there
Just one more step
Because we are almost there
We have come too far
To turn around

Ooh!!

[Verse 6]
Keep on reaching
For higher ground
We have had our ups and we have had our downs
Let nothing in the world darling
Turn us around

Because we are almost there
We are almost there
We are almost there

Everything we are looking for
We are almost there
Keep on reaching out for me

[Outro]
Because we are almost there darling
We are almost there
We are almost there darling
We are almost there
We are almost there

Ah, we are almost there
