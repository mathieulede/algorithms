Is it Love, that I feel
I just got to know myself, is it real
What I'm feeling inside
It must be Love, because my nose is open wide
Some people think that love is just a game
And when it comes to breaking hearts they feel no pain
But what you need
Is someone just like me
Because I'm Love, and kind and I'm understanding
I'm a capable man and I'm not demanding
Is it Love that I feel
Many people
Fall in love, but not for real
I'm so full of desire
I just want to hold you and squeeze you
And, baby, light your fire
Some people just don't know, quite how love feels
But when it makes you act like this, ooh wee, baby
It's for real!
I've always wanted someone just like you
Because you're Love and kind and you're understanding
You're a beautiful girl and you're not demanding
This is love
I know it's love that I feel
I found out for myself that it's real
That my feeling, deep down inside
Sho nuff, baby
Sho is Love, baby, and you're the reason why

Some people think that Love is just a game
And when it comes to breaking hearts
Hey, baby, they feel no pain
But, baby, from now on it's me and you
Because you're love and kind and you're understanding
You're a beautiful girl and you're not demanding
I want to spend my life with you
Nobody else in this whole world can do
Just what you do for me, baby
Oh, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
I want you walkin' by my side
I want to be your man, and be your guide
I want to be with you, baby
Oh, baby, ooh wee, baby, let me be your man
Hey, baby
