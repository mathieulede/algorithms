No (ow, now)
Hey, now, huh-huh
Hey, hey, hey, no

Fire (uh) (uh)
Fire (it's all about)
(Uh, uh)
Fire (woo, woo, woo)
Fire

The way you walk and talk
Really sets me off
To a full alarm, child
Yes, it does
Uh

The way you squeeze and teas
Knocks to me my knees
â€˜Cause I'm smoking, baby, baby

The way you swerve and curve
Really wrecks my nerves
And I'm so excited, child (yeah)
Woo, woo

The way you push, push
Lets me know that you're good
(You're gonna get your wish)
Oh, yeah

Fire (what I said, child, ow)
Fire (uh-huh)
Got me burning, burning, burning
Got me burning, burning, burning (yeah)
Got me burning, burning, burning (yeah)

Woo, hoo, hoo, baby
Start burning, burning, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Burning, burning, baby
Oh, baby

Pour some water on me

When you shake what you got
And girl, you've got a lot
You're really something, child
Yes, you are

When you're hot, you're hot
You really shoot your shot
You're dyn-o-mite, child, yeah

Well, I can tell by your game
You're gonna start a flame
Love, baby, baby

I'm not gonna choke from the smoke
Got me tightenin' up my stroke
Do you feel it, girl, yeah

Got me burning, burning, burning
