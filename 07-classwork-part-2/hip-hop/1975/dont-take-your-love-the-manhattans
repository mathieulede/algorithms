(Me and you, me and you)

Don't take your love from me
I got to have your love by my side
Don't you ever take your darling, darling

Girl if you really turn my whole life around
If I can see you baby my love comes tumbling down
There's no words to express how I feel
You made all of my dreams become real
And together I'd know we can feel

A love so strong

Don't you ever, don't you ever
Take your love from me

You see baby I feel like I can't have a life if I can't have it with you
I know I couldn't adjust to any other life
Baby please don't take your love from me
I know a man ain't suppose to cry heh, baby if you leave me I swear I don't know what I'll do please don't take your love from me
