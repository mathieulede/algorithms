People want truth
Or nothing at all
People want sincerity
And nothing false
People need happiness as land needs rain from above
We need rain-we need life-we need love

Most people find it so hard to live
Without love, love, love
To live without love, love, love
Oh yeah-oh yeah

People want to live
Not merely exist
People want to enjoy
Not suffer and fear
People need understanding
Not impatience nor confusion
Oh, I wonder, should we hate
Those who present us disillusion
They talk about love, love, love
And they lie about love, love, love
They talk about love, love, love
Oh yeah-oh yeah

We need power, we need power
And we need peace, peace, peace, peace
I think we all agree
Let's stop fighting, let's stop fighting
And become sis and bro, 'sis and bro'
Sis and bro', sis and bro'
And show it's not too late to love, love, love
What can i do for you? What can you do for me?
