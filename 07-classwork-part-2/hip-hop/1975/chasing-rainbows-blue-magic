I'm chasing rainbows
She passed away and I was so afraid
'Cause there was just no one else who cared
Need someone to talk to, guess I'm feelin' I'm lost
Find myself just runnin' away, chasing rainbows in the dark

And until the day the eagle flys
I'll wait for you
Until I hold you close again
I'll pray for you
Kick off my shoes
And sing this song for you

Oh-oh, I'm just chasing rainbows
And I ain't seen a star as bright as your smile
I'm chasing rainbows
Like a butterfly zooming through the sky

She loved fancy shoes and she would smile at me so cool
And when she laughed it just made my day
The days have turned to teardrops, falling colder than the snow
And ups and downs are getting me down, it's no wonder that I'm cold

So until the day the eagle flys
I'll wait for you
Until I hold you close again
I'll pray for you
Memories of me
Sing this song for you

Oh-oh, I'm just chasing rainbows
And I ain't seen a star as bright as your smile
I'm chasing rainbows
Like a butterfly zooming through the sky

The only one for me
Yes, I'll be running around
Chasing rainbows
Oh, here I go..........(I'm chasing rainbows, I'm chasing you)

(Like a butterfly) I-I'm (zooming through the sky)

(Whoa-oh, I'm..) And I finally found it's true (..just chasing rainbows)
Love no one but you, (I'm chasing you) so bad losing you
(Like a butterfly) I-I'm (zooming through the sky)

(Whoa-oh, I'm..) I.... (chasing rainbows) ......
(I'm chasing you)
(Like a butterfly) I-I'm (zooming through the sky)

(Whoa-oh, I'm..) And I finally found it's true (..just chasing rainbows)
Love no one but you, (I'm chasing you) so bad losing you
(Like a butterfly) I-I'm (zooming through the sky)
