[Verse 1]
Listen to me brothers
Listen well
Brothers we got something to tell
You can't run around
Being a married man
You're not taking care of business very well
You've got to keep yourself together
If you dig on what you got
'Cause what you got can sho'nuff mean a lot

If you ain't taking care of business
This you must expect
Love gets slippery when it's wet

You know hanging loose can be outta sight
But hanging loose
No it just ain't right
You see slipping a tipping
Having fun ain't no good
Leaving homework undone
You've got keep your thing together
If you dig on what you've got
'Cause what you've got can sho'nuff mean a lot

If you ain't taking care of business
This you can expect
Love gets slippery when it's wet

If you ain't taking care of business
This you can expect
Love gets slippery when it's wet

Uh huh slippery, slippery
Love gets slippery when it's wet oh
It'll slip away yeah
Love gets slippery when it's wet ooooooh
Love gets slippery when it's wet
Slippery, slippery
Love gets slippery when it's wet
Don't let your love slip away
Love gets slippery when it's wet ow
Taking care of business
Love gets slippery when it's wetâ€¦
