[Intro]
Do what you wanna do
So much in life to see you through
Be what you wanna be
Be strong and tell the world you're free

[Verse 1]
I see the children of the world
Searching to find themselves and who they are
So many roads for them to choose, yeah
So many ways for them to win or lose
Oh this, is
Your life
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
This is your life
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I see you there
Dying in your wisdom
Where do you go, tell me
Where do you go
Just see the light
Shinning through your window
Why can't you see, tell me now
Why can't you see

I'm longing to see
If your search will find
A peace of mind
Yeah-yeah-yeah, peace of mind

[Chorus x 4]
