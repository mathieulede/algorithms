[Verse 1]
The boy is born in hard-time mississippi
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction

[Chorus]
Living just enough, just enough for the city...Ee ha!

[Verse 2]
His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you better believe she hardly gets a penny

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
His sister's black but she is sure enough pretty
Her skirt is short but lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
Cause where he lives they don't use colored people

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'm living just enough
For the city... Ooh, ooh [x14]

[Verse 5]
His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of new york city
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel no where could be much colder
If we don't change the world will soon be over
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city!!!!

[Outro]
I'm living just enough
For the city... [x5]
