I didn't know (didn't know)
Ooh, you're gonna be my baby, hey
(Be my baby, ooh)
I didn't know
That then you would drive me crazy
(Drive me crazy)
Mmm, didn't know when you're branded witch's dust
It would be the start of a love affair
Chokes me up to ever think of leaving you
Hope you feel that same way, too
I didn't know (didn't know)
You're gonna be my baby, yeah
(Be my baby, ooh)
I didn't know
That then you would drive me crazy
(Drive me crazy)
Ooh, you swoop down on me like a pompoulin dove
Clipped my wings and I knew I was in love
Thought I was in love with another man
But look at me, I'm in the palm of your hand
I didn't know (didn't know)
Ohhhh, you're gonna be my baby, yeah
(Be my baby, ooh)
I didn't know
That then you would drive me crazy
(Drive me crazy)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doooooooo
Doo, doo, ooh, ooh, ooh
I didn't know (ooh)
You're gonna be my baby, yeah
(Be my baby, ooh)
I didn't know (ooh)
That then you would drive me crazy, hey
(Be my baby)
Didn't know (oo-ooh)
Didn't know (oo-ooh, ooh)
Didn't know (be my baby)
I didn't know (oo-ooh, ooh)
Ooh, you're gonna be my baby, yeah
(Be my baby)
Said I didn't know (oo-ooh, ooh)
Didn't know (oo-ooh, ooh)
Didn't know (Be my baby)
Said I didn't know (oo-ooh, ooh)
Didn't know (oo-ooh, ooh)

Didn't know (oo-ooh, ooh)
You're gonna be my baby, yeah
