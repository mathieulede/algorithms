Get up - everybody!
Happy people are we
Happy people are we

Throw away your life long pain and follow, yeah
I'll take you to a land of peace and a new tomorrow, hey
Brothers, sisters, come and take my hand
I will take you to a better land
Sunshine people love is all you bring
Dawn of a new day and here's the song we sing

Happy people are we - well, well, well, well
Happy people are we - hey
Listen children, now

Don't believe in this troubled world
We can get higher - higher
Come on along and I'll take you there
People, my people, let's party and get down
Life is for livin now let's don't mess around
Dance to the music, throw your cares away
It's a song of hope and better days
