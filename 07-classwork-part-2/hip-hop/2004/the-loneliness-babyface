I'm sitting here
Thinkin' 'bout
How I'm gon-na do without
You around
In my life
And how am I, I gon' get by
Ain't got no days
Just lonely nights
If you want the truth
Well girl I'm not alright
Feel out of place
And out of time
I think I'm gonna lose my mind

So tell me how you feel (I'm lonely)
Are you for real? (So lonely)
Do you still think of me? (I think of you)
Baby still? (You only)
Do you dream of me at night? (Like I dream you all the time)
So lo-o-o-o-o-one

Oh let me tell you how it feels (It's like everyday I die)
Wish I was dreamin' but it's real (When I open up my eyes)
Oh let me tell you how it feels (And don't see your pretty face)
I think that I will never love agai-i-i-in

I miss your face
I miss your kiss
I even miss, the arguments
That we would have
From time to time
I miss you standing by my side
I'm dying here
It's clear to see
There ain't no you, God knows there ain't no me
Don't wanna live
I wanna die
If I can't have you in my life

So tell me how you feel (Oh)
Are you for real? (For real)
Do you still think of me? (I think of you)
Baby still? (You only)
Do you dream of me at night? (It's like I dream you all the time)
So lo-o-o-o-o-one

Oh let me tell you how it feels (It's like everyday I die)
Wish I was dreamin' but it's real (When I open up my eyes)
Oh let me tell you how it feels (And don't see your pretty face)
I think that I will never love agai-i-i-in (Will never, I will never love again)

(Repeat until end)
So tell me how you feel (I'm lonely)
Are you for real? (So lonely)
Do you still think of me? (I think of you)
Baby still? (You only)
Do you dream of me at night? (It's like I dream you all the time)
So lo-o-o-o-o-one

Oh let me tell you how it feels (It's like everyday I die)
Wish I was dreamin' but it's real (When I open up my eyes)
Oh let me tell you how it feels (And I don't see your pretty face)
I think that I will never love agai-i-i-in (I'll never ever ever love again baby)
