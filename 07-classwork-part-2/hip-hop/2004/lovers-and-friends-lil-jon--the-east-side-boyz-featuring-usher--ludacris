[Verse 1: Usher]
Baby how you doing? Hope that you're fine
Want to know what you got in mind and I
Got me feenin' like Jodeci, girl I can't leave you alone
Take a shot of this here Patron and it's gon' be on
V-I-P done got way too crowded
I'm about to end up callin it a night
She should holla at your girl tell her that you're shaking the scene
Pulled off beep beep shotgun in the GT with me
She said, "Ohhhhh! I'm ready to ride
(I was like) Yeah
Cause once you get inside, you can't change you mind
Don't mean to sound impatient but you gotta promise baby
Ooh!!

[Hook: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again, my baby)Tell me again, my baby
That we'll be lovers and friends (Ohh! I gotta know baby, oh yea)
Tell me again (Make sure you're right, oh before we began)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Ohh! Oh it's a good look baby)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It's a really good look baby, look here

Sometime wanna be your lover sometime wanna be your friend
Sometime wanna hug hold hands slow dance while the record spins
Opened up your heart cause you said I made you feel so comfortable
Used to play back then now you all grown up like Rudy Huxtable
I could be your +Bud+ you could beat me up
Play fight in the dark then we both make up(make up)
I do, anything just to feel yo butt(butt)
Why you, got me so messed up
I don't know but you gotta stop tripping(tripping)
Be a good girl now turn around and get these whippings(whippings)
You know you like it like that
You don't have to fight back(back) here's a pillow bite that
And I'll be setting separate plays
So on all these separate days your legs can go they separate ways

[Hook: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Ohh! its a good look baby)
Tell me again (Tell me over and over and over again)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Make sure you're right before you choose)(Ah drastic)

[Verse 3: Lil Jon]
I's been knowing you for a long time (shawty)
But fucking never crossed my mind (shawty)
But tonight I seen something in you (shawty)
That made me wanna get with you (shawty)
You ain't been nothing but a friend to me (shawty)
And a nigga never ever dreamed we'd be (shawty)
Up in here kissing, hugging, squeezing, touching (shawty)
Up in the bathtub rub-a-dubbing (shawty)
Are you sure you wanna go this route (shawty)
Let a nigga know before I pull it out (shawty)
I would never ever cross the line (shawty)
Shawty let me hear you tell me one more time
One more time

[Hook: Usher]
Tell me again (Tell me again my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Ohh, it's a good look baby)
Tell me again (Make sure you're right oh before we leave)
That we'll be lovers and friends (Tell me over and over and over again)
