[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Verse: 1]
All up in the club looking fly
Made your first approach
And caught his eye

Slowly move your way
Towards the dance floor
Grabbed her hand
And she whispered
Hold my hip
Got in the groove

Stand behind me
Let me grind with you
If I lick my lips
I'm probably feeling you
Imma make you go ooh

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Verse: 2]
Whoo
(You feelin' it now)
Take it slow

Turn me on
Club gets warmer
Body moves closer

One with the rhythm
Don't stop moving
You're making me hot
From head to toe

I feel your flow
Vibe gets stronger
Party seems longer
Makes me really want ya

Don't stop moving
You're making me
Hot

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Bridge]
Can you feel the beat
Can you

Can you feel the beat
Can you feel the beat
Can you
Can you feel the beat

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through the dark

Can you feel the beat

Can you feel the beat within my heart
Can't you see my love shine through the dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart

[Jabba]
Slow wind, slow wind, slow wind, slow wind
Fast wind, fast wind, fast wind, fast wind
Move your body, move your body
Move your body, move your body

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go

[Chorus]
Move your body, girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it, girl
Makes the fellas go
