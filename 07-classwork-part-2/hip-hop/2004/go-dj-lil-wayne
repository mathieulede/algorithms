[Intro: Mannie Fresh & Lil Wayne]
Grown-ups, in between children and babies
Right about now is your boy, ya heard
Back again, DJ Mannie Fresh
Go DJ, that's my DJ
Well Weezy Wee, step up to the mic dude
Do what you do, ya heard
Ladies and gentlemen
What you have here
Is brought to you courtesy of
The young man Young Carter
And the great man Mannie Fresh
So what I want y'all out there
To do for me is, say this
Say go DJ, cause that's my DJ

[Verse 1]
Murder 101
The hottest nigga under the sun
I come from under the Tommy
Busting a Tommy
You'll come from under your garments
Your chest and your arm hit
Pow! One to the head
Now you know he dead
Now you know I play it
Like a pro in the game
Naw, better yet, a veteran in hall of fame
I got that medicine, I'm better than all the names
Ay, it's Cash Money Records, man, a lawless gang
Put some water on the track, Fresh, for all this flame
Wear a helmet when you bang it, man, and guard your brain
Cause the flow is spasmatic, what they call insane
That ain't even my motherfuckin' aim
I gets dough, boy
And you already know that pimpin'
18, how I'm living? Young'n, show that Bentley
Stunna my Pa, so you know that's in me
Gotti my mentor, so don't go there with me
(Let me hit the blunt first)

[Hook]
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ
Say go DJ, cause that's my DJ
(This is Tha Carter)
Say go DJ, cause that's my DJ
Say go DJ, cause that's my DJ
(These niggas is hilarious
Put your binoculars on, try to see me)
Let's go

[Verse 2]
And I move like the coupe through traffic
Rush hour, GT Bent', roof is absent
Your bitch present with the music blastin'
And she keep askin'
"How it shoot if it's plastic?"
I tell her "You'll see if your boy run up"
She sat back and cut Tha Carter back up
Oh fa sho
Ay Big Mike, they better step they authority up
Before they step to a sergeant's son
I got army guns
You niggas never harmin' Young
Fly Wizzy, my opponent's done
I'm done talkin' (shut up!)
And I ain't just begun
I been running my city like Diddy, you chump
I fly by you in a foreign whip
On the throttle with a model bony bitch
Pair of phony tits
Her hair is long as shit
To her thong and shit
Well here we go, so hold on to this
Now let's go
(Hold on let me hit the blunt again)
So go
This is Tha Carter

[Hook]
Go DJ, cause that's my DJ
Say go DJ, cause that's my DJ
(These niggas so mad at me right now Fresh
Guess what though, guess what)

[Verse 3]
Birdman
Put them niggas in a trash can
Leave em outside of your door
I'm your trash man
I'm steady lighting up the hash, and
Riding in my Jag
You will need a gas mask, man
You snakes
Stop hiding in the grass
Sooner or later I'll cut it
Now the blades in your ass
You homo niggas
Getting AIDS in the ass
While the homie here
Trying to get paid in advance
I'm staying on my grizzy
I'm a bona fide hustler
Play me or play with me
Then I'm gonna find your mother
Niggas wanna eat
Cause they ain't ate nothing
But niggas wanna leave
When you say you out of mustard
So I'mma walk into the restaurant alone
Leaving out, leaving behind just residue and bones
In your residence with Rugers to your dome
Like "Where the fuck you holding the coke!?"
Holding your throat, choke
