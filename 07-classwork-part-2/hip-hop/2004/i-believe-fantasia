[Verse 1:]
Have you ever reached a rainbow's end
And did you find your pot of gold
Ever catch a shooting star
And tell me how high did you soar

Ever felt like you were dreaming
Just to find that you're awake
And the magic that surrounds you
Can lift you up and guide you on your way

I can see it in the stars
Across the sky
Dreamt a hundred thousand dreams before
Now I finally realize

You see I've waited all my life
For this moment to arrive
And finally I believe

[Verse 2:]
When you look out in the distance
You see it never was that far
Ohhh, no
Heaven knows your existence
And lead you to be everything you are

Ohhh
There's a time for every soul to fly
It's in the eyes of every child
It's the hope
The love that saves the world
And ohhh, we should never let it go

[Chorus x2:]
I believe in the impossible
If I reach deep within my heart
Overcome any obstacle
Won't let this dream fall apart

See, I strive to be the very best
Shine my light for all to see
Cause anything is possible
When you believe, yeah

Love keeps lifting me higher
Lifting me higher
Love keeps liftin me higher
I said love keeps lifting

Love keeps lifting me
I said love keeps lifting
Love keeps lifting me higher
Said love keeps lifting me higher
I said love keeps lifting me high
