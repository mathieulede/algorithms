[Verse 1]
Heard about the party now
Just east of Harlem
Doug E's going to be there
But you got to call him
Even the soldiers
Need a break sometimes
Listen to the groove you'll
Let it unwind our mind
No intoxication
Unless you see what I see
Dancing hot and sweaty
Right in front of me
Call it what you like
I'm going to call it how it be
This is just another one
Of God's gifts
Musicology

[Chorus]
Keep that party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old school joint
For the true funk soldiers
Musicology

[Verse 2]
Wish eye had a dollar
For every time you say
Don't you miss the feeling
Music gave you
Back in the day?
Let's Groove
September
Earth, Wind and Fire
Hot Pants by James
Sly is going to take you higher
Minor keys and drugs
Don't make a rollers hate jam
Take your pick - turntable or a band?
If it ain' t Chuck D
Or Jam Master Jay
Know what?
They're losing
Cause we got a PhD in
Advanced Body Movin'

Keep the party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old-school joints
For the true funk soldiers

Musicology!

Hold it down, band

"Get back! Move, get back!
Don't you touch my stereo, these are MY records!"
"Don't touch, Ever touch, these are MY records!"

Musicology, musicology!

Everybody get down!
Kick the high-school joints
For the true funk soldiers

Get goin'!

Keep the party movin'
Keep the party movin'
Uh, don't stop dancin'

Keep the party movin'

Keep the party movin'
Just like I told ya
Kick the old-school joints
For the true funk soldiers

Musicology!

For the true funk soldiers
