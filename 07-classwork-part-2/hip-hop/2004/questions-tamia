I noticed you ain't been around lately..
I recognize there's a sudden change..
I noticed you haven't been calling me..
I'm starting to see things aren't the same..

Lately I've been reaching out to you..
Boy you haven't been returning my calls..
And even when I say I love..
I notice there's been a slight pause..

Please tell me what do you think it could be..
Headache.. Tired.. or cheating on me
I'm tired of this up and down mystery..
Please answers questions from one two three..

Chorus
Do you love me? Lost interest.. Is he cheating
Oh lady's help me out.. Do you love me..?
Lost interest..? Is he cheating..
Said I'm tired of this up and down mystery..
Do you love me? Lost Interest Is he cheating..?
Fella's tell me what your thinking.. Do you love me?
Lost interest..? Is he cheating..?

Here's the reason why I ask these things..

I was giving him the best of me..
But my best stop being good enough..
I'm telling you I'd do anything..
Talk about a woman who loves tough..

And now he's coming home real real late..
I let him know it's starting to bother me..
He never once even touched his plate..
And no response.. He just went to sleep..

Please tell me what do you think it could be..
Headache.. Tired.. or cheating on me
I'm tired of this up and down mystery..
Please answers questions from one two three..

Chorus

Can you see why I ask these things?

Use to take me shopping.. ( All the Time )
Use to go club hoppin'.. ( All The Time )
Where you were I would be ( All The Time )
Now all you do is leave me.. ( Behind Boy )

I use to be your best friend.. ( Remember )
We were close like cousins.. ( Remember )
Use to give me lovin' ( And Now )
Now all your doing is trippin' ( Please what do you think )

Please tell me what do you think it could be..
Headache.. Tired.. or cheating on me
I'm tired of this up and down mystery..
Please answers questions from one two three..

Chorus until it fades
