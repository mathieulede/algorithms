[Intro]
1, 2, 3: go!

[Verse 1]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sho
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking through together
Cause we don't know how

[Hook]
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

[Verse 2]
You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But "got it" just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all
We've been together
Oh, we've been together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes
Love the exception?
So why oh why why oh why
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance

[Hook]
Hey ya! Uh-oh
Hey ya! Uh-oh
Don't want to meet your daddy, Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want you in my Caddy, Uh-oh, Hey ya! Uh-oh
Don't want to meet your mama, Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want to make you cumma, Uh-oh, Hey ya! Uh-oh
I'm, I'm, I'm
Hey ya!
I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest

[Bridge]

We're gonna break this back down in just a few seconds

Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor! Ah, here we go!
