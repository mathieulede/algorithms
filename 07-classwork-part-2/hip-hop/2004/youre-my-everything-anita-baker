Ooooh Baby

Got the sun in the morning
I got the moon at night
I got your arms around me, everything's alright
Holdin you tight is how I'd like to spend all
The rest of my life

Feel the warm breeze blowing
Down through the trees, I
I've got your love beside me child, that's all I need
My heart and soul is wide open to you
Nobody but you sweet baby
No one but you

Chorus

Got to know that I want you baby
Got to know that I need you darling
I just want to say you're my everything
Like in all the songs I sing of happiness and joy you bring
I just want to say you're my everything

Just want to hold you
How I adore you
You've got that special touch that I long for oh so much
Oh, I'm amazed at how you right all that's wrong in my world

All I am
And hope to be
Is cause of you and what you do
You bring out the best in me
My heart and soul is wide open darling
Nobody for you sweet baby
No one but you
Yeah you

Chorus

Got to know that I want you baby
Got to know that I need you darling
I just want to say you're my everything
Like in all the songs I sing of happiness and joy you bring
I just want to say you're my everything

Baby, Baby, Baby, Ohhhhh Yes!

Child you posses all that a true love should be
Cause I'm forever loving you, you keep loving me
Yeah, oh me baby

Cause you baby
Ohhh, Ohhh, darling
I, Yes
Oh Baby
