Oooohh Ohhh Ohhh Ohhh

Verse ONE:
Ooohh For everytime he broke your precious heart
Did it with no regrets
Ooohh For everytime he started going off
And showed you no respect
Ooohh For everytime he used to scream on you
As if you were a child
Ooohh For everytime he didn't tell you the truth
One lie after a lie I'm gonna.....

Chorus:
Make it all

Make it alright(Make it alright)
Make it all

Make it alright(Make it alright)
Make it all
Make it all
Make it alright

Verse TWO:
Ooohh Everytime he went and stayed out all night
And you left home alone
Ooohh For everytime you would have been alright
If he just picked up the phone
Ooohh For everytime you wanted to up and leave
But you didn't know quite how to
Ooohh Ooohh For everytime you wanted someone like me
To love and cherish you

Chorus:
Make it all

Make it alright(Make it alright)
Make it all
Make it all
Make it alright(Make it alright)

You don't have to look no further because I'm right before you
Believe things will be better cause I'm not going to hurt you
I'm just here to love you

Come home to a clean house with your man
Come home with groceries and remedies
