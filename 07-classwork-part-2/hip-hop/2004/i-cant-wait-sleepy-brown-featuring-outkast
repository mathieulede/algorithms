This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
This is such an art, where do I begin, uh
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fire
I'm the type of guy that notice subtle signs
When I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin'
To look sexy. But even if she was, so what?
Motherfucker grow up; don't mean to be so abrupt
But that lets me, know that she's a human being
And being human's hard, on the boulevard
Girl, you got it bad, glad I'm not one
But yet you got it good, you are the hot one
But I'm Andre, Benjamin Andre to be exact
You'd hope to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that
In fact, Dookie introduced at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the Southern states, you know, where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes you're getting booed if your shit do not get down
And yes you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks
Ascot to match the socks
What's in your Speakerboxxx? Pink and Blue
You're lollygaggin', you're slow pokin'
You got me open, you're playin' wit me, darlin I'm not a toy
As if Anita Baker brings the joy
Your kind are the Tyner, meanin' the real McCoy
I can't wait

[Sleepy Brown]
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

Ooh baby, come home
Got plans tonight (plans tonight 4x)
Anticipated, the love and I'm gon' get it
'Til the mornin' light (mornin' light 4x)
Come on, baby

I can't wait (the way you love me)
I can't wait (the way you touch me)
I can't wait (I can feel it)
I can't wait (all over me)
I can't wait (come on, baby)
I can't wait (please come home)
I can't wait (tonight)
I can't wait (whoo)

For your time, you're so fine
You're always on my mind
'Cause baby I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait
I'm so glad I found you
I just wanna be around you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

Ooh, its been too long now baby
Lets seize the night (seize the night 4x)
'Cause I'm gonna take you on a journey
Enjoy the ride (enjoy the ride 4x) enjoy the ride
Up and down (ooh baby!)
Up and down (whoo lady!)
Round and round (take it..)
Round and round (whoo)

For your time, you're so fine
You're always on my mind
'Cause baby I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait
I'm so glad I found you
I just wanna be around you
I can't wait, I can't wait
I can't wait, no can't wait

This is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)
In you... In you... In you

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Sir Luscious is the real deal, but even he gets antsy
Some honeys try to Kill Bill beneath the underpants see
But patience is a virtue to being anxious, just might hurt you
Like Mike Vick returning to the line of scrimmage too soon
A line of niggas tryin' get in Vision on a full moon
Should I play it cool, or be the one to make the first move?
Anticipatin', and contemplatin', she got you sprung, dude
Shit, I'm finna get her, might even hit her, what you gon' do? (wha?)
I tell you what, we won't be fallin' for that one, two
Just kinky sex up off in the Boom Boom if she want to
And if she don't, then I'll dial another date
That means find another face to replace, 'cause I can't wait
