[Verse 1]
Let's pretend for one night, I'm the man in your life
And we do the things that lovers do
All the loving you like, I give it to you just right
There's nothing less than special when it comes to you

[Pre-Chorus]
See what we have is understanding
That works so well for how we are
Cause neither of us has the heart
To fall in love all over again

[Chorus]
Even though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl
But let's just act like it's that way tonight
Now I know you got your friends and you know I got some too
But let's just act like you're my lady tonight

[Verse 2]
Now what I like about you
Is that you're always so cool and comfortable whenever I'm around
You're someone that I can talk too
No matter what I'm going through I call on you
Cause I know you'll always be down

[Pre-Chorus]
See what we have is so incredible
That we'll never find in anyone else
This thing that we share is so unbelievable
That I want you all to myself

[Chorus]
Even though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl
But let's just act like it's that way tonight
Now I know you got your friends and you know I got some too
But let's just act like you're my lady tonight

[Bridge]
Oh, I know that we both have our separate lives
And we don't keep ties on each other
So you can have me
So that I can hold you until the morning comes
Then we can go back to how things was before

[Chorus]
Even though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl
But let's just act like it's that way tonight
Now I know you got your friends and you know I got some too
But let's just act like you're my lady tonight
Even though I'm not your man and I know you're not my girl
But let's just act like it's that way tonight
Now I know you got your friends and you know I got some too
But let's just act like you're my lady tonight

[Outro]
Tonight, tonight
I like it (I like it)
I love it (I love it)
It feels good to me (It feels good to me)
So good to me (So good to me)
I like it (I like it)
I love it (I love it)
It feels good to me (It feels good to me)
So so good to me (So so good to me)
