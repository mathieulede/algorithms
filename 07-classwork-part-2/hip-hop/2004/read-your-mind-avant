Listen, I've been waiting to tell you this
You are more than a man could ever want
WAIT A MINUTE JUST LET ME
Listen

Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
BUM BUM BUM
Yeah yeah... yeah... yeeeah

Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
BUM BUM BUM
Yeah

Baby I stepped in the club in your hood
I slowly turned left and there you stood
You and your friends talking
But when I eyes connect I knew then
It was just like two waves on beat
I'm your king, be my queen
And what do you want to do tonight
My truck is parked out front, so lets ride

(Chorus:)
I can read you mind baby
And I know what your thinking
But its alright (with me baby), it's alright (with me) baby (x2)

So baby take a ride with me
And I'll fulfill all your fantasies
And when the rain starts pouring down
Then all the love that's lost will be found
I'll make your mind lose control
Over your body, thats my goal
So baby just come and down here
Just let the gravity pull you near

(Chorus x2)

(HOOK: (X2))
I know you wanna rub
I know you wanna touch
I know you wanna feel
So baby keep it real

I know you wanna see
I know you wanna be
In my b-e-d
Grinding slowly (breathing)

(CHORUS (X2))
(Breakdown:)
I wanna LOVE baby
I wanna feel you
(IF YOU COME, IF YOU COME)
I WANNA LOVE baby
I wanna feel you (I WANNA FEEL YOU)

Come on and go with me
I want you to stay with me (x2)
