My ladies that be steady sippin Cris'
Always lookin nice, put some ice on they belly or they wrist
Girls that be thick off in they thigh, I wanna kick it in the Chi

Baby now look, model girls, Gucci and Prada girls

Women that be steady stackin ends rollin Lexus or Benz with rims
And know how to keep it lookin good
Workin wit'cha fine thick ass
Somebody gon' snatch you so I gotta make you mine quick fast
See I come and pass, I don't really wanna wonder
So I gotta put her numbers in my Sidekick fast
Rollin wit'cha mob workin hard, gettin money, pullin capers
If I ain't got papers you will bring me some beans home
Supervisor givin orders on the job
But you still lookin good with them skin-tight jeans on
Lookin hot in them heels, I think I want that
Come and back it up to the bottom of my throwback
When you rollin yo' rims clickin like a Kodak
When I drive I wanna smoke, she will roll that
Miss mobstress rollin with the hardest
Holdin it down like a female Joe Pesci
And I wanna make her a made woman
I hope she gon' let me, cause she looks so sexy
