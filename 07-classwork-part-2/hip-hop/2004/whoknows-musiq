[Verse 1]
Now what we came here to do
It means more to me than just a night
That we'll share so make sure that you're prepared
Baby and know that love is not just something to do
It's the moment that transcends
Our physical into a more spiritual level of understanding

[Chorus]
And who knows somehow this night just might lead us
Into a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go
Cause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions
And lose ourselves inside a world made for us and no one else
Hey girl just let me love you

[Verse 2]
Now ain't no need to be afraid
Cause I'll be as gentle as it takes
To provide you with the right amount of pleasure and pain
And I'll make sure that you feel alright
Even if it takes me all night cause the joy is all mine
Now when I know you're satisfied
So let's keep giving all we got

[Chorus]
Who knows somehow this night just might lead us
Into a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go
Cause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions
And lose ourselves inside a world made for us and no one else
Hey girl just let me love you

[Bridge]
Listen, now I can see it in your eyes, yeah
That you want to baby just as bad as I do
And girl I wanna give it to you
Now if you can just set aside your fears
And just try to deal with
What's going on with us right now

[Chorus]
Who knows somehow this night just might lead us
Into a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go
Cause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions
And lose ourselves inside a world made for us and no one else
Hey girl just let me love you
Cause who knows somehow this night just might lead us
Into a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go
Cause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions
And lose ourselves inside a world made for us and no one else
Hey girl just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you
