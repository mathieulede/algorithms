[Refrain: John Legend]
I'm calling (Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)
All my (Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (Maybe I'm selfish)
Let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with no one
But me, baby

Come on

[Verse 1: T3]
To my thick chicks down in Texas
All the way to New Orleans where the girls cook catfish
And in LA every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass and symbolize sex
And Hot Atlanta y'all is one of the best
Where they speak Southern slang and smoke la cess
And New York women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feeling myself too much I guess
But to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
Whether you see me in streets or catch me at shows
I'm calling

[Hook: John Legend]
(Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)
All my (Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (Maybe I'm selfish)
Let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with no one
But me, baby

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And don't be tryin to come around my girl acting like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
Get your own, I got Paris he got Nicky
He tried to get em a clone
He said Ye you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
Can I please, say my peace
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heat rocks
Spit like a beat box, the way the beat rocks
New version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switch my girls around like 3-el-dub
I'm calling

[Refrain: John Legend]
(Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)
All my (Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (Maybe I'm selfish)
Let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with no one
But me, baby

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
What up Pam how your little man doing in New Jersey
Last I heard he caught the flu and you was worried
Hope he feels better
And thanks Jonetta from Cleveland
For that good head in your Jetta better believe it
Shanice you're my piece from Compton
Before I'm off the plane make sure you cop some trees and spark up
Danielle ATL got them pictures in the mail
You sealed with a kiss and you send it with Chanel
You looking good in that one showing off your body
Had a Beverly Hills Mami that would buy me Carti's
Take me to after parties her name was Carrie
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch I'm sorry
But, hey Kim how's Minneapolis, you so pretty
Hate to show off your titties for silly classes
Cause I love you girls though you ain't mine
I wish my arms was long enough to hug you all of the same time

[Refrain: John Legend]
I'm calling(Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Out to (I want you to myself I can't help it)
All my (Yeah maybe I'm selfish)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (Maybe I'm selfish)
Let you (I want you to myself, I can't help it)
Be with no one
But me, baby

I'm calling (Calling)
Out to (Out to)
All my (All my)
Y'all my ladies
And I can't (I can't)
Let you (Let you)
Be with no one
But me, baby
