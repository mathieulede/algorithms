Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad

[Verse 1:
Oh, girl
I loved you
But you turned and you walked away
I would love you more tomorrow
Than I know I do today

You told me that you'd never hurt me
Girl, you just tore my life apart
Tell me, baby
Why'd you do it
Won't you bring me back my heart?

I tried to understand it, baby
I searched my heart
Inside my mind
I searched the depth
Of my whole soul, baby
There was nothing there to find

You told me that you'd never leave me
Girl, you just went
And told a lie
Tell me, baby
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you make me wanna cry?

[Chorus:]
Why you treat me so bad
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you do me the way you do

Why you treat me so bad
I don't know why, baby
Why you treat me so bad
Why you treat me so bad

[Verse 2:]
Boy, just let me tell you
How I really and truly feel
I know that I have doubts and issues
But now I'm gonna tell you the deal

You tell me that
I always hurt you
I don't know what you're talking 'bout

Tried to love you
Tried to hold you
But you always seemed to doubt

You've told me that
You didn't trust me
And you didn't want me around
Show somebody else your interest
Now you walk around with a frown

Sorry that you say I hurt you
But you know
You hurt me too
I'm begging you, baby
I need you back
Because I'm still in love with you

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
I sit here all alone just thinking
How our love could be
But everytime I call you up
You won't talk on the phone with me

Just don't know if I can take it
Girl, you make me cop a plea
You've got me begging for your loving
Can't you see it's killing me?

I just don't understand you, baby
After all I've done for you
You know we've both
Gone through some changes
Now you say your love is true

Boy, you know how much I loved you
And now I guess my heart has changed
Don't beg me, baby
Can't take you back
I've found myself another man

[Repeat Chorus:]

Oh, girl
I don't know
Why you treat me so bad
Do what's right

Why you treat me so bad
I don't know
Why you treat me so bad, so bad
Why you treat me so bad
