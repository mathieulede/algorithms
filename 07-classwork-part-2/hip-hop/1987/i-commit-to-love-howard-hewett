I can look you in the eye
And tell you I can't do without you
I want to live my life
Like an open book, do you

Like a thief in the night
The way you stole my heart, keep it
I don't want it back
I know it's in good hands

Baby, I commit to love
You know I'm there for you
Baby, I commit to love
Baby, I adore you

I can't turn my back and run
'Cause love has finally come and swept me off
I know the question your heart will ask
And that is will it last forever

All that I can say
There's no instruction book to show you
No fool-proof way
Depend on what you need and how strong you commit, oh, girl

Show me you are with me Show me you're with me
Baby, I commit to love
If I go, you'll miss me
If I go you'll miss me

Oh, I commit to love
Please girl, don't waste our time
Baby, I commit to love
I'm yours, tell me you're mine

Oh, we grow stronger every day
We must give in to love this way, oh
No matter what we keep holdin' on
If you'll commit to love now
All you got to do is

Say it
Say it
Come on, say it
Say it

When you love this strong
Move out in single life
Gonna have to give it up
Oh, girl, I admit

Baby, I commit I commit to love
You know I'm there for you
Oh, I commit to love
Baby, I adore you I adore you, girl

Baby, I commit I keep holdin' on
Show me you are with me
Oh, baby, I commit to love
I commit to love
If I go, you'll miss me
Girl, you'll miss me, girl

Baby, I commit
Oh, I commit to love, oh
Please girl, don't waste our time
Don't waste our time
I commit to love Girl
I'm yours, tell me you're mine
