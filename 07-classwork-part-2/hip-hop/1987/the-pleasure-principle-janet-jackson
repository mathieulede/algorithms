[Verse 1]
You might think I'm crazy but I'm serious
It's better you know now
What I thought was happiness was only part time bliss
You can take a bow

It was all just one big night out on the town
Riding in your limousine
We turned right and I said wrong which brings us to a stop
As the light is changing

[Chorus]
Oh my meters running so I've got to go now
It's the pleasure principle, oh-o, oh-o, oh-ooo
It's the principle of pleasure, oh-ooo
It's the pleasure principle, oh-o, oh-o

[Verse 2]
It's true you want to build your life on guarantees
Hey, take a ride in a big yellow taxi
I'm not here to feed your insecurities
I wanted you to love me

This has become an all too familiar scene
It's not the first time I paid the fare
Where'd you get the idea of material possession?
Thank you for the ride, nowhere

[Chorus]
And oh my meters running so I've really got to go
It's the pleasure principle, oh-o, oh-o, oh-ooo hoo
It's the principle of pleasure, oh-ooo ah
It's the pleasure principle oh-o, oh-o, oh-oh ohhh ah-ah

[Bridge]
I know, what you mean to me
Baby this is nowhere
You know, what became between you and me
Human differential

Di-da, di da-daaa
Oh-o, it's the pleasure principle (yeah)
The pleasure principle, the pleasure principle (di da-da baby)
Oh-o (yeah), the pleasure principle
It's the pleasure principle, oh-o, oh-o, oh-oh ohhh ah-ah

[Bridge 2]
You might say, that I'm no good for you
I wouldn't trust your looks, baby if I could
I got so many, things I wanna do, before I'm through
Hey yay, di-da, di da-daaa

Oh-o, it's the pleasure principle (yeah)
The pleasure principle, the pleasure principle (di da-da baby)
Oh-o, the principle of pleasure
The pleasure principle

[Outro]
(Oh-o) Baby you can't hold me down
Baby you can't hold me down
After all the love that we've been through
After all you've put me through
Yeah yeah, hey yeah
(Oh-o) Love me, love me, yeah, love me, yeah!
Hoo-ooh, (Oh-o) ooh-ooh ooh ooh
(It's the pleasure principle, oh-o, oh-o, oh-oh ohhh ah-ah)
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah!
