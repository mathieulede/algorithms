I was playin for keeps
But she was playin' a game
Now she's gone and left
And I don't know if I'll ever be the same

I wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who she's holding now
I wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who she's foolin'

She doesn't know now
She's tearing me apart
Breaking my heart, well
Doesn't know what I'm goin' through
I don't know what I'm gonna do
It's getting harder every single day

Without her
I wonder who she's seeing now
Oh I wish that I knew
I wonder who she's holding now
I wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who she's foolin'

If I could find a way to turn back the tide
When she was still mine
To the love I'll remember with
I'll hold her in my arms again
And never let her slip away

I wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who she's holding now
I guess it's more than breathing hard
I wonder who she's foolin'

I wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who the girl's seeing right now

Even though she'd be gone today
Now I got to find my own way, yeah
Even though I need her more each day

I wonder, I wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who's holding her right now
I don't know, I wonder who's she seeing now
I wonder who she's foolin', baby

I wonder, I wonder who she's foolin' now
I wonder who she's foolin' now
I wonder who she's seeing now
I wonder who she's fooling

If they got everything you need
But they gave you all the love you want
'Cause they know how to love you baby, love you baby
Love you baby
