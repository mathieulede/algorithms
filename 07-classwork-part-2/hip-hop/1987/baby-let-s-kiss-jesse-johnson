Oooo girl' spend a little time
I'd like to know just what's on your mind
You're not too happy baby well' neither am I
We gave our love and now they make us cry

Now it's you and me all alone
Relax baby let our feelings take control
With time on the run I have one wish baby
For me and you girl aww let's uh'

Let's kiss uh!
Baby let's kiss
No' no' no' no

Oooo girl' I wonder if you know
You make me want to get physical
So take your time baby take it slow
I'm so in love girl I'll never let you go

All along' just you and me
We're so good baby' wouldn't you agree'
With time runnin' out I have one wish baby
For me and you girl' aww let's uh'

Let's kiss uh!
Baby let's kiss
Baby let's kiss
Oh!

All of my life people tellin' that I ain't no good
They always try to make me out to be what they think I should
Yeah' yeahhh
But now that you're part of my life' aww yes you are
Together I know we can go very far
Yeah' yeahhh

Ooo! No' no' oh' no' no yeah' h' h
Baby let's kiss
C'mon a' hey' hey no' no' no
Baby let's kiss
Rub my body baby' touch my body baby' hold my body baby
C'mon a' hey' hey no' no' no
Baby let's kiss

Baby let's kiss
