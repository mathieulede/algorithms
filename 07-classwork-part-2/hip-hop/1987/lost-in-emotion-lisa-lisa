Hit the beat now
Lost in emotion

[Verse 1:]
Some guys will promise you
A marriage made in heaven
But I'm gonna stick to my guns

Like waiting for that love
That I might be getting
Mv dreams haven't yet begun
Oh, baby

Am I a fool?
Cause I don't know just how you feel
And my love for you
Oh my
I can't conceal

[Chorus:]
Oh
I'm lost in emotion
Telling you things
You really shouldn't know

Oh, baby
I'm lost in emotion
Am I a fool?
At least my friends think so
Que sera, que sera

Baby, whatever will be
Que sera, que sera
Between you and me

[Verse 2:]
Just how true
Are the rumors I am hearing?
About the crush you have on me?
(Ooh)

Oh baby
I'm blind
Cause I just don't see it
But I wanna believe what they see

I find myself telling you things
I don't even tell my best friend
(Ooh)
I keep showing emotions not knowing
Just where it all stands for us

From time to time
I wonder what I am in your heart
'(Sometimes you make me wonder)

And even though
I don't live there yet
I'm afraid it will be cold and dark

[Repeat Chorus:]

Oh, no

[Bridge:]
Baby, am I a fool?
Cause I don't know just how you feel?
(Just how you feel)
And my love for you
Oh, my
I can't conceal

Hit the beat now

(Lost)
With my feeling
(Lost)
I hit the ceiling
(Lost)
With big emotions
(Lost)
I can't be dealing

(Lost)
I wanna be with you
(Lost)
But I don't know how
(Lost)
In my heart, babe
I can feel the beat now

(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)

(Lost)
My baby
You know that I'm lost
My baby
(Lost in emotion)
My-m-m-y-my baby

(Lost in emotion)
(Lost in emotion)
(Lost)
