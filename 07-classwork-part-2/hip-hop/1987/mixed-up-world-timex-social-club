This world is all mixed up

This world is all mixed up

This world is, this world
This world is all mixed up

(This world is all mixed up, there's something going on Fix it up, clean it up
This world is all mixed up, there's something going on
Fix it up, clean it up) This world is all mixed up

Story goes two people so very much in love
Perfect match like fingers in a glove
Wanted to be together forever

Went out and tied the knot
Time showed they should have not
But oho, they started slowly falling

First everything seemed okay
But at least they headed in the right way
They started to lose control
He found himself on a straight down hill road

Curiosity got the best of him
When he met this pretty girl named Kim
His thing and then cut out
But how's he gonna feel when his wife finds out?

This world is all mixed up, there's something going on
We'd better fix it up, clean it up
This world is all mixed up, there's something going on And with any luck we'll blow it up

Lil' Joey on his way home from school
Doing nothing wrong just being cool
He was every mothers little treasure

It happened in the spring of '84
Little Joeys disappearance rocked the world
Along with all the teary eyes
You know there's gonna come a lot of why's

Why does no one every see a thing
Another child is missing the headlines sing
Sitting here trying to figure it out
But the pain only makes me want to shout

Well, he police don't have a clue
Joey's parents don't know what to do
What kind of person would harm a kid
Someday they're gonna pay for what they did

This world is all mixed up, there's something going on (Let's take it up)
We'd better fix it up, clean it up (Clean it up)
This world is all mixed up, there's something going on (Hey, hey, hey!)
And with any luck we'll blow it up

This world is all mixed up, there's something going on We'd better fix it up, clean it up (Fix it up!)
This world is all mixed up, there's something going on (Let's bring it up!)
And with any luck we'll blow it up (Blow it up!)

This world is, this world
This world is, this world
This world is all mixed up

(This world is all mixed up, there's something going on) I can see some day
(Fix it up, clean it up) We can work it out
(This world is all mixed up, there's something going on) And I can see some day
(Any luck, blow it up) When we come together

(This world is all mixed up, there's something going on) Hey, hey, hey!
We'd better fix it up, clean it up
This world is all mixed up, there's something going on
And with any luck we'll blow it up

This world is, this world
This world is all mixed up

Story goes two people so very much in love
Perfect match like fingers in a glove
Wanted to be together forever

Went out and tied the knot
Time showed they should have not
But oho, they started slowly falling

First everything seemed okay
They started to lose control

Curiosity got the best of him
His thing and then cut out

This world is all mixed up, there's something going on (Hey, hey, hey!)
We'd better fix it up, clean it up (Oho!)
This world is all mixed up, there's something going on And with any luck we'll blow it up

This world is, this world
This world is all mixed up

This world is, this world
This world is all mixed up
