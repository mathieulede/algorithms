Situation

[Verse 1:]
Here I am stuck in this rut again
Ooh
I don't know what to do
And I haven't got a friend in the world
No, no, no
Baby, not even you

But situation number two ain't bad
But number nine ain't good
But I thought I was riding really high
'Cause I'm here hanging in Hollywood

Boy, I hate to tell you
But you really need to check yourself
The life that you're living
Is gonna catch up to you
Boy, I think you need some help
Oh, yeah

[Chorus:]
Situation number nine
Blowing my mind
Situation number nine
Blowing my mind

[Verse 2:]
Rumors circulating round about me
And my lavish lifestyle
But situation number nine
Sets me free from my tour
For awhile
(Well, well, well, well)

I hear somebody knocking at my door
Who, I wonder
Who could it be?
(I wonder who it is)

Some people say that
I'm paranoid
But they don't really know me, no

Boy, I hate to tell you
But you really need to check yourself
(You really need to check yourself now)

The life that you're living
Is gonna catch up to you
Boy, I think you need some help
Hey, yeah

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Bridge:]
Ooh, I don't know what to do
I can't take it no more
Somebody's knocking at my door
Who could it be
That's coming here for me?
I wish that you'd just go away
Hey, yeah

I tried so hard to do what's right
But it seems
It's just not enough
Situation number nine
Is just blowing my mind

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Situation number nine
Blowing my mind
