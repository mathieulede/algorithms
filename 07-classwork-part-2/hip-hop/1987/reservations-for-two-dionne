It's been so long
Since I last saw you
We're always running
No time for loving
Let's take some time out
To know each other again
You know I miss you
You're my best friend

I don't want to lose you
You're the one I'm living for
And I need you here beside me
Can't be without you anymore

Let's make reservations for two
This is just between me and you
There will be standing in line
Because tonight you're mine

We'll unplug the phones
Turn the lights down low
Hold each tight
And take it real slow
I want you to myself
To share with no one else
Make each moment last
For ever and ever and ever

Pretend we're on an island
All alone just you and me
Where no one will ever find us
There's no place I'd rather be

Let's make reservations for two
This is just between me and you
There will be standing in line
Because tonight you're mine

Tonight you're mine
Tonight you're mine
Oh tonight you're mine
Mine

I don't want to lose you
You're what I'm living for
Oh I need you here beside me here baby
Can't be without you anymore

[Repeat Chorus]
I don't want to lose you
You're what I'm living for
Oh I need you here beside me here baby
Can't be without you anymore

Let's make reservations for two
This is just between me and you
There will be standing in line
Because tonight you're mine

We've got reservations for two
This is just between me and you
There will be no standing in line
For baby, tonight you're mine
Tonight you're mine
