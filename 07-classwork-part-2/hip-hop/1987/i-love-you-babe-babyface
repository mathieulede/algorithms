[Verse 1:]
Love never came between us
For love was too deep in our hearts
It's the silly things we do
Between us
That managed to tear us apart

But, oh
I believe if we work real hard
We can get through
Through it this time

Girl
Just trust me and I will trust you
There'll be nothing
That we can't get through

[Chorus x2:]
I love you, babe
In the scariest way
I want you, babe
To stay with me

I love you, babe
Though I'm hurting to say
I want you, babe to stay with me

[Verse 2:]
Trust never came between us
And that's just the way that we are
It's the crazy things we do
Between us
That managed to break both our hearts

But, oh
I believe that we can survive
Through anything
If we'd only try

Girl
Just trust me and I will trust you
There'll be nothing
That we can't get through

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Baby, stay
Won't you stay
Baby, stay with me
