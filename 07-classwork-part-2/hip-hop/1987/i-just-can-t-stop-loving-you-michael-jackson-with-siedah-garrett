[Intro]
I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold hou
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

[Michael]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

[Siedah]
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

[Michael]
I just can't hold on

[Siedah]
I feel we belong

[Michael]
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

[Siedah]
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll fine
A love so true

[Siedah]
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

[Michael]
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"

[Siedah]
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong

[Michael]
This feeling's so strong

[Siedah]
Well, my Life ain't worth living

[Both]
If I can't be with you

[Chorus]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

[Michael]
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge]
[Siedah]
We can change all the world tomorrow

[Michael]
We can sing songs of yesterday

[Siedah]
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow

[Michael]
This is my life and I

[Both]
Want to see you for always

[Chorus]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)

I just can't stop loving you (Without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
