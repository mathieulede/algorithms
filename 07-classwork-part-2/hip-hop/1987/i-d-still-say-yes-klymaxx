I love you most when we share a place
Those special good times together
It seems like our love, can't get much better(no)
'Cause we were as close as two could be
We knew love could last forever
We're more than just lovers
We're good friends

And even if our love has drift away
I wouldn't even think twice
If I wanted love back again

Because I'd still say yes to you again
My darlin' for you, I'd do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin' for you, I'd do it over and over again
(Say yes...ooohh)

Where does it go, how does it end
True love it seems so easy
'Cause we have no doubts
Where we belong (where we belong)

They say time can heal a broken heart
True love never ends
So why not start where we begin

Because I'd still say yes(say yes) to you again
My darlin' for you, I'd do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin' for you, I'd do it over and over again
(Say yes, over and over...heeeyyy...say yes...say yes..ooohhh)

They say time can heal a broken heart
True love never ends
So why not start where we begin(let's start where we begin)

Because I'd still say yes to you again
My darlin' for you, I'd do it all again
Yes, I'd still say yes to you again
Darlin' for you, I'd do it over and over again
(Over and over...say yes, say yes...oh, girl...say yes)
Say yes, to you again
Darlin' for you, I'd do it over and over again (say yes...ooohh)
