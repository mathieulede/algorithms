We've only just begun, the romance is not over
Gotta lot, a lot of love to give
We've only just begun, the romance is not over
I got so much love to give

I remember oh so well
When I first held your hand and we started to dance
I had this awesome crush on you
Hoping deep down inside that you wanted me too

And now we're here together
Preparing ourselves for the future, yeah
'Cause there's so much that we can do
Oh girl, let me show you

We've only just begun, the romance is not over
Gotta a lot, a lot, a lot of love to give
(To give)
We've only just begun, the romance is not over
I got so much love to give

Let's go to our favorite place
Ooh, close to the fire and let our passions run wild
And love the night away
I'm just dying to please you, oh, I'll never leave you

Oh girl, let's stay close
And get lost in each other's love
'Cause there's so much more that we can do
Oh, I love you, girl and I'm gonna show you

We've only just begun, the romance is not over
Gotta lot, a lot of love to give
(To give)
We've only just begun, the romance is not over
I got so much love to give

Girl, I think that I love you too much
I wanna be with you everyday
I'm gonna always be your lover
Oh, believing in each other, girl

We've only just begun, I'm yours forever
I really need you so, yes, I do
I got so much more love to give, baby, don't you know?
It makes me feel so good inside just to know you

We've only just begun, the romance is not over
Gotta lot, a lot of love to give
We've only just begun, the romance is not over
I got so much love to give, hey

(We've only just begun)
Baby, we've just got started
So let's have ourselves a good time
(We've only just begun)
We're gonna do so many things together

(We've only just begun)
Girl, I can be with you, I, I can be with you
Every second, every minute, every hour
(We've only just begun)
Everyday if you want me to

I'm gonna show you things that you've never seen before
Gonna make you say, ooh, oh, oh, feel so good to me
Gonna make you say, ooh, oh, oh, feel so good to me
Keep on doing what you're doing
'Cause what you're doing sure feels good to me, baby
