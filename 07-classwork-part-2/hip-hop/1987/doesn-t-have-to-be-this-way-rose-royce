Every time I try to make you see
The way our life should be
The two of us with no one in between
You turn away, you won't share my dream

How can I be so sure
That you're feeling the same, yeah
I realize there's no cure
But this is insane

It doesn't have to be this way
It doesn't have to be this way
We can work it out
We can work it out

Doesn't have to be this way
We can work it out
We can work it out

Don't you think that time is closing in
Time keep closing in, it's closing in
Come with me and you'll be given
A first class ticket to heaven

Your love is so secure
Through fire and rain, you know it is
I can assure you
I'll erase the pain

It doesn't have to be this way
It doesn't have to be this way

We can work it out
We can work it out

Doesn't have to be this way
We can work it out
We can work it out

S.O.S
Save our love
S.O.S
Save our love

S.O.S
Save our love
S.O.S
Save our love

How can I be so sure
That you're feeling the same, yeah
I realize there's no cure
But this is insane

It doesn't have to be this way
It doesn't have to be this way
We can work it out
We can work it out

Doesn't have to be this way
We can work it out
We can work it out
