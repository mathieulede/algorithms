I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
Like a star up in the blue
Like I was fallin' off Niagara
In a paddle-boat canoe
Mmm, I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
And it's all because of you

Like I was walkin' on a tightrope
Swingin' in the breeze
And though I try to keep my balance
Yeah I weaken in the knees
I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
Lover, help me please

Like a leaf falls from a branch
Like a rock-slide avalanche
Like the rain on a stormy day
I never thought I'd fall this way

I thought that love could never touch me
Yeah I was ridin' high
And then my ivory tower toppled
And I tumbled from the sky
Mm, I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
You're the reason why

Like Goliath when he met his foe
Just like the walls of Jericho
Like Delilah's home in town
When Samson tore it down

I thought that love could never touch me
Yeah I was ridin' high
And then my ivory tower toppled
And I tumbled from the sky
Mm, I got to feelin' I'm a'fallin'
And you're the reason why
Oh you're the reason why
Lover you're the reason why
Lover, lover you're the reason why...
