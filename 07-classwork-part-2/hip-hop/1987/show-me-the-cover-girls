You say that you really love me
I'm always on your mind
And you say I should be your lover
And we should spend some time

But I'm not persuaded that quickly
My heart has been broken before you see
So if you want to be my lover
You have to prove your love is true to me

Cause it's easy
To tell me you love me
Easy to say
You're thinking of me
Words are so easy to say

Show me, show me
You really love me
Actions speak louder than words

Show me, show me
You really need me
Cause all those lies I've already heard

Show me, show me
You really love me
Let me believe that it's true

Show me, show me
You really need me
And I'll get together with you

You say that there is no other
I am the only one
And you say that if we were lovers
We would have so much fun

But my mother warned me
That I should beware of young boys
Saying things that you say

So I must be sure that
If I give you my love
You won't take it then run away

Cause it's easy
To tell me you love me
Easy to say
You're thinking of me
Words are so easy to say

Show me, show me
You really love me
Actions speak louder than words

Show me, show me
You really need me
Cause all those lies I've already heard

Show me, show me
You really love me
Let me believe that it's true

Show me, show me
You really need me
And I'll get together with you

Show me, show me
You really love me
Actions speak louder than words

Show me, show me
You really need me
Cause all those lies I've already heard

Show me, show me
You really love me
Let me believe that it's true

Show me, show me
You really need me
And I'll get together with you
