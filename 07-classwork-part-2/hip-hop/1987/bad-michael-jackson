[Verse 1]
Your butt is mine
Gonna tell you right
Just show your face
In broad daylight
I'm telling you
On how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind
Don't shoot to kill
Come on, Come on
Lay it on me
All right

I'm giving you
On count of three
To show your stuff
Or let it be
I'm telling you
Just watch your mouth
I know your game
What you're about

[Pre-Hook]
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait til I get through

[Hook]
Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone) (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone)
You know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to
Answer right now
Just to tell you once again:
Who's bad?

[Verse 2]
The word is out
You're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up
Before too long
Your lying eyes
Gonna tell you right
So listen up
Don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap
You're not a man
You're throwing stones
To hide your hands

[Pre-Hook & Hook]

[Pre-Hook]
We can change the world tomorrow
This could be a better place
If you don't like what I'm saying
Then won't you slap my face?

[Hook]
