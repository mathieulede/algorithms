There you are again, baby
Let's stop fooling around
Here we go again, darling
Wandering across town

You keep running
But you can't hide, baby
I know everywhere you go
Just stand here, darling
And let you walk right out the door
I'm begging you

Don't go nowhere, baby
I'll be right by your side
Don't go nowhere, baby
I'll love you every night and day

Every night and day
I follow you, yeah
You're just the one I need
Girl I love you
Ooh

Listen, honey
Won't you let me show you my love?
Every night is yours
And I just wanna tell you, darling
I'm not going to let you walk out that door
I'm telling you

Don't go nowhere, baby
I'll be right by your side
Don't go nowhere, baby
I'll love you every night and day

Darling, can't you see
I'll win your heart again
Baby, won't you stay
And we just be friends
Yes, it's time
Without you
I'll never be the same again

Are you going to stay
You know I've always thought about
I've always wanted you
I knew it was love
When I first met you
And I can't let you
Walk out the door

Don't go nowhere, baby
I'll be right by your side
Don't go nowhere, baby
I'll love you
Every night and day
