Baby, tell me
Are you serious
Hey, boy, you got me
So delirious

Why don't you
Stop playing games
Ooh, boy, do you think
You'll ever change

Baby, I don't know what I
Should do, no, about you
You sure make me feel
Like loving you, huh
You sure do, come on, baby

(Are you serious)

So tell me, your heart
Belongs to someone else
Baby, I just can't
Be killing myself

No, no, you got me
Going round and round
Honey, I can't seem
To settle down

Baby, I don't know what I
Should do, no, about you
You sure make me feel
Like loving you, huh
You sure do, come on, baby

(Are you serious)

Talk, talk about serious
Talk, talk about serious

Breaking hearts
Was my claim to fame
And I don't know
If I'm gonna change

But if I'm really
Gonna be your man
I'm gonna change
My ways if I can

Talk, talk about serious
Talk, talk about serious

You and me
Right from the start
Everything was fine
Then I broke your heart

So I'm telling you now
Like I told you then
If we can't be lovers
Let's just be friends

Baby, I don't know what I
Should do, no, about you
You sure make me feel
Like loving you, huh
You sure do, come on, baby

(Are you serious)

Breaking hearts
Was my claim to fame
And I don't know
If I'm gonna change

But if I'm really
Gonna be your man
I'm gonna change
My ways if I can

Talk, talk about serious
Talk, talk about serious...

You and me
Right from the start
Everything was fine
Then I broke your heart

So I'm telling you now
Like I told you then
If we can't be lovers
Let's just be friends

Talk, talk about serious
Talk, talk about serious...
