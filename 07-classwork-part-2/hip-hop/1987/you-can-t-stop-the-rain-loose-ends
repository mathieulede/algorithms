Oo-o-o-o-o (Oooooo,oooo,ooo) Oh-oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

Yo do dum-dum da dae dum
Yo do dae, yo don don do whoa
Yo do dum-dum da dae dum
Yo do dae

Seems to me, a little bit of fantasy
Walkin' blind...
To give sometimes, to search beyond
There's no bell to ring...

There will come a day when the lightning will crash
Maybe then we'll see...
Everything we've known all gone in a flash
Is this our destiny?

Oh-oh-oh...

You can't stop the rain... (You can't stop the rain)
When it starts to fall (When it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame (There's no one else to blame, yeah...)
You can't lock that door

There comes a day
Eee-every one will find, who they are...oh yeah
So find no heart
Don't ever stop
To see our destiny

Ohhhh...

There will come a day when the lightning will crash
Maybe then we'll see...
Everything we know all gone in a flash
Is this our destiny?

You can't stop the rain... (You can't stop the rain)
When it starts to fall (When it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame (There's no one else to blame)
You can't lock that door

Yo do dum-dum da dae dum
Yo do dae, yo don don do whoa
Yo do dum-dum da dae dum
Yo do dae

Yo do dum-dum da dae dum
Yo do dae, yo don don do whoa
Yo do dum-dum da dae dum
Yo do dae

You, you...you can't stop the rain (You can't stop the rain)
When it starts to fall (When it starts to fall)
There's no one else to blame (There's no one else to blame)
You can't lock that door

Hang on now, now...â€¦ (You can't stop the rain)
You can't stop the rain
When it starts to fall
There's no one else to blame (There's no one else to blame)
You can't stop the rain...
