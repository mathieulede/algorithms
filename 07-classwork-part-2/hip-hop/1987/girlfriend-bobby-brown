[Verse 1]
I remember the very first time
You the picture of love in my eyes
You and me, girl, holding hands
Please be my lady, won't you understand?

[Chorus]
I need a girlfriend
And I need her right now
Loving
Kissing
Holding you tight
Never letting go

I need a girlfriend
And I need her right now

[Verse 2]
Can I call you? Would that be all right?
Maybe Friday or Saturday night?
Girl, I think of you all the time
Cause it's you that I need, girl, and you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
I need a girlfriend
And I need you right now
Loving, kissing, holding you tight
Never letting go

I need a girlfriend
And I need you right now
Loving
Kissing
Holding you tight
And keeping you warm, oh, yeah

[Bridge]
I need a girl who feels like I do
Could it be you?
So please help me

[Chorus]
Girlfriend (Gotta have your love)
Loving, kissing, holding you tight
Never letting go

I need a girlfriend (And I need you right now, no)
Loving, kissing, holding you tight
And keeping you warm, baby

[Outro]
Someone just like you
Oh, girl

It's you that I want, girl
And I need you right now
I really need you so
Yeah, baby

It's you that I want, girl
And I want you right now
I really need you so
I need you, baby

I just want to love you, and kiss you, and hold you so tight
Whoa, baby
Yeah
Can I do that to you, sweetheart?

I just wanna love you, and kiss you, and hold you so tight
Whoa, baby, no
You know what I mean, girl

[Chorus]
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend
I need a girlfriend

I need a girlfriend
Would you be my girl?
This is Bobby talking

(I need a girlfriend)
La la la la la
Woo
(I need a girlfriend)
La la la la la
(I need a girlfriend)

(I need a girlfriend)
La la la la la
(I need a girlfriend)
I said la la la la la
(I need a girlfriend)

Oh, girl
You know what I
(I need a girlfriend)
You know what I need now
So it's up to you
To give me what I need
(I need a girlfriend)
And I do need a girlfriend

So, um
Let's take some time
And let's take it slow
(I need a girlfriend)
But surely we should be together
(I need a girlfriend)

You gotta answer me
Some time today, baby
Cause I can't wait no more
I love you
