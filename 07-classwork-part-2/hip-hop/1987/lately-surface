Oh, dreams
Dreams of you

[Verse 1:]
I'll do anything
To spend a little time with you
The way you turn my world all around
Feels so good

When I go to sleep late at night
All I see, girl
Is you
All I see is you
Baby, you blow my mind
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus:]
Lately
I've been dreaming to myself
And girl, I really want you bad
Lately
I've been dreaming to myself
And girl, I really want you bad

[Verse 2:]
Look into my eyes
What I'm going through
Might see something you like
A paradise for two
Me and you

Oh, won't you take a little time now
That you know how I feel
Don't need no lie detector
To see I'm for real
I want you bad

Won't, won't
You do like you do
Late at night
When I'm dreaming about you
Girl, you're one of a kind
I wish that you were my baby

[Repeat x2:]

Lately
I've been dreaming to myself
And girl, I really want you bad
