[Verse 1:]
Lately love keeps keeping up at night
Tossing and turning my love
Wanna kiss you
Wanna hold you real tight
Oooh

But I wonder, love
Whether you know or not
You just hurry away
Leaving me laying there in shock

I just wanna be
The one that you wanna see
I just wanna have you near me

But you fly away
Almost every day
You work a lot
But you never stop to love

[Chorus:]
(Stop)
I love you so
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Gotta stop to love

And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home

[Verse 2:]
You say my love
Has always been on your mind
But how can I ever love you
When you keep working overtime?

Too many empty nights
Can make almost any guy roam
To look for the love
He don't get
Whenever he's at home alone

Awaiting the day
That you're coming to stay
I hate to see you go away

But you couldn't rest
Had to do your best
To reach the top
But you did not stop to love

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
And one day you'll discover
I'm the one who love you
Gotta stop to love

No one loves you better
Can't you stay forever
Stop to love
I can hardly stand the loneliness

Come on home
That's what it's all about
You really turn me out

[Chorus:]
I love you, stop
(Stop)
Love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Got to stop to love

And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
The love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
(Got to stop to love)

I love you, stop
(Stop)
I still love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
Got to stop to love

And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
All the love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
Got to stop to love

I love you, stop
(Stop)
I still love you, stop
(Stop)
Come home from the road
(Got to stop to love)

And let's celebrate
(Celebrate)
All the love we got
(Stop)
Say you're coming home
