[Intro:]
Alright yaul, oh, oh, oh
(uh, oh, uh, oh, oh, oh)
Hey, hey, ooh, yeah

[Verse 1:]
Feels like my battery's in need of a jump
Our love is running down, done fell into a slump
Give me a spark to get the fire burning
A get my engine movin, set these wheels a turnin
Our love could use some rejuvination
You bring the wine, I'll bring the sweet conversation
Romance is here to stay, I'll testify 'cause I need some today
So won't cha

[Chorus:]
Jump start my heart
Charge me up when I'm runnin down
Oh, jump start my heart
Lift my feet up off the ground

[Verse 2:]
When it comes to lovin', baby can't get enough
Hotwire me, satisfy me, don't give me up
Turn on the heat on a cold winter's morning
Don't let the seasons change and nature catch me callin
Can't let this feeling just slip away
Our love was meant to last forever and a day
We can't neglect what we cherish the most
So drop your foolish pride 'cause I need you more and more

[Bridge:]
(Nothing good comes easily)
Ooh, we've got to work it 'til we get it right
(You see I love you so)
(I'll never let you go) I'll never let you go
(I wanna hug you) Oh (and kiss you, keep you right here with me)

[Chorus] (2x)

[Breakdown:]
(Jump)
Don't step on me now
Alright let's uncross (Jump) those wires
When I say hit it, y'all hit it
Ignition, ignition
Give it a little gas y'all, come on, ow!
Ooh, Baby (Jump) uh, oh, uh, oh, oh
I say don't stomp hard, Baby (Jump,Jump)
(Jump) Lift me up
Take it on up (Jump start my heart, my heart) yaul

[Bridge]

[Chorus] (2x)

I know the groove is cold

Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart
Jump, jump start my heart, jump, jump start my heart

Mm, Mm, Hm
Get it, get it yaul

(Charge me up when I'm runnin down)
