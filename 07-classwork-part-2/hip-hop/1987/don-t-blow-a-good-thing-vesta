[Verse 1:]
No, another lover just won't do
You feel the same for me boy
That I feel for you
Stop the silly games and the attitude
(Get yourself together, baby I'm waiting)
You know it's in the stars just for you and I
I put aside all the times that you made me cry
Still the one I love and I fantasize
(You're the one I want to hold for always)

[Pre-Chorus:]
I need your love
(Need you beside me)
I want your love
(Give it to me)
I'll earn your love
(Do what you want me to)
Baby, please be true, yeah

[Chorus:]
So don't you blow a good thing, baby
Don't you know a good thing when
It's staring you right in your face
Don't you blow a good thing, baby
Don't go and disappear on me without a trace

[Verse 2:]
Baby, won't you tell me what you're gonna do
Are we giving up or will we see it through?
Why don't you think about it?
Take a day or two
(Don't you be too hasty with your decision)
Don't do something that you might regret
You've made a few bad moves
I haven't been wrong yet
If I lose you baby, I'll be so upset
(I don't want to have a head on collision)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

So don't you blow a good thing, baby
So don't you blow a good thing, baby
And disappear on me without a trace

[Chorus]

So don't you blow a good thing, baby
So don't you blow a good thing, baby
And disappear on me without a trace
