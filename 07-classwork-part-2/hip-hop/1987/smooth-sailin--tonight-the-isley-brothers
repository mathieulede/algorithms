Nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
Every single heartache will be kissed and loved away
And at my desires height the body will obey
Lay your hands on me, girl, touch my burnin' sand
Let your waters calm me, your wish is my command
You can count on me, yeah
(Count on me)
I'll set you free and easy
Any fantasy, yeah
Will be acted out completely
Nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Oh, baby)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(You know, you know)
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Oh)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(I know, I know)
Lay down here beside me and we'll cruise the caravan
Let your fingers guide me to the pleasures you demand
Let my lips caress the deepest portals of your soul
Feel the fire I possess, I got to let you know, girl
You can count on me, girl
(Count on me)
I'll set you free and easy
(Every)
Any fantasy
Will be acted out completely
Nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Oh)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Oh, yeah)
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Nothin?)
(Oh, baby)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Oh)
Every single heartache will be kissed and loved away
And at my desires height the body will obey
Lay your hands on me, girl, touch my burnin' sand
Let your waters calm me, your wish is my command
(Count on me)
Oh, I'll set you free and easy
Any fantasy
(Any fantasy)
Will be acted out completely
Nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(You know, you know)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Oh, yeah)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Are you ready, girl)
Let's go sailin', sailin', girl
Don't you wanna go, wanna go, wanna go sailin'?
(Count on me)
I'll set you free and easy
(Every fantasy)
Will be acted out completely, oh
Nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Oh baby, baby)
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Nothin? but smooth, smooth)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
(Nothin? but smooth)
There'll be nothin' but, nothin' but smooth sailin' tonight
(Smooth)
Anything that you want from me is my delight tonight
