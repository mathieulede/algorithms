I'm (x8)
Had we met at a different time we'd be perfect for each other
Now were spending all our time, in this world come together
My heart is aching, from all the love your giving
Were not faking, is this the life were living?

I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you
Now I'm right on time
I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you
I feel right on time

More and more we are together, tryin to discover
I see a flicker in your eye, are you lookin for somethin better?
You once told me lying on the ground, but keep goin up and down, yo!

I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you
Now I'm right on time
I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you
I feel right on time

I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you
Now I'm right on time
I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you
I feel right on time

Why waste it thinkin about it? Taste it
Don't waste it thinkin about it, taste it

It really doesn't matter wherever I may go
We're tied together, that's one thing we both know, yo!

I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you
Now I'm right on time
I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you
I feel right on time

I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you
Now I'm right on time
I'm not perfect, but I'm perfect for you
I feel right on time

Right on time, I feel on time tonight, I right on time, I feel right on time
Right on time, I feel on time tonight, I right on time, I feel right on time
Right on time, I feel on time tonight, I right on time, now I'm right on time
