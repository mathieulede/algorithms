My baby's into the rhythm
She says she can't do without it
All that she does is to the beat
Upstairs the radioâ€™s playinâ€™
I cannot hear what sheâ€™s sayinâ€™
Over the sound of slightly innocent feet

So I take her by the hand (Whoa, oh)
Then I lead her to the floor (Whoa, oh)
With the music in my head, weâ€™re on a roll
You suppose it could be (Whoa, oh)
Because she really wants me (Whoa, oh)
With the feelinâ€™ that I have Iâ€™d like to know, oh

Dance all night
Live and love in the party life
Dance all night
Till I make you mine

Dance all night
Live and love in the party life
Dance all night
Till I make you mine

Up, down, in and around it
Sheâ€™s got a fever about it
And what she does, she likes to lead
I tell her, â€œBaby, no problemâ€
You got it all hands down and
The survey says that youâ€™re all I need

So I take her by the hand (Whoa, oh)
Then I lead her to the floor (Whoa, oh)
With the music in my head, weâ€™re on a roll
I was thinkinâ€™ it can be (Whoa, oh)
Because she really wants me (Whoa, oh)
And with the feeling that I need, I got to know, oh

Dance all night (Ah, baby)
Live and love in the party life
Dance all night
Till I make you mine

Dance all night (Ah, baby)
Live and love in the party life
Dance all night (Ah, baby)
Till I make you mine

Dance all night
Dance all night
Till I make you mine

So I take her by the hand (Whoa, oh)
And then I lead her to the floor (Whoa, oh)
With the music in my head, weâ€™re on a roll
You suppose it could be (Whoa, oh)
Because she really wants me (Whoa, oh)
And with the feeling that I have, weâ€™re on a roll, oh

Dance all night (Ah, baby)
Live and love in the party life
Dance all night
Till I make you mine

Dance all night (Ah, baby)
Live and love in the party life
Dance all night
Till I make you mine

Dance all night
Live and love in the party life
Dance all night
Till I make you mine

Dance all night
Live and love in the party life
Dance all night
Till I make you mine

Dance all night (Ah, baby)
Live and love in the party life
