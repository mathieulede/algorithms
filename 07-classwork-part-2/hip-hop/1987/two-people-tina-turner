[Verse 1]
Two people living on the edge of life
Are people running out of dreams and time
I can hear it when you tell me so
And I can feel it but I can't let go

[Chorus]
Two people got to stick together
And love one another, save it for a rainy day
Some people got to stay whatever
And give one another shelter on a rainy day

[Verse 2]
Two people living in the way we do
Are people trying to keep a love anew
What to say to make some sense of it
And what to do to make the feeling fit

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ill come running to your rescue
You got to stand by me
Theres a lot of love between us
And we should never let go, oh

[Chorus][3x]

[Outro]
Two people, stick together
One another, save it for a rainy day
Some people stay whatever
