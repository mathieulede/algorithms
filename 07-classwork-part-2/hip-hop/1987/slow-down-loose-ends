[Hook]
Shake the ground

[Verse 1: Jane Eugene]
I've been waiting
While you've been living
How do I get through to you
Well my body's shaking
Anticipating
Trying to figure your next move

[Verse 1: Carl McIntosh]
Baby I've got to move
Cause I'm tired of watching you
And I can't slow down
Or keep my feet on shaky ground

[Chorus]
Slow down
Cause I can't take the heat slow down
Slow down
Cause I can't take the heat slow down

Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on

[Verse 2: Jane Eugene]
If you won't give me
What I've been missing
Someone else will have to do

[Verse 2: Carl McIntosh]
Then I guess that's how it's got to be
You for you and me for me

[Chorus]

Is this the part you take my heart to wipe your feet on

[Chorus]
