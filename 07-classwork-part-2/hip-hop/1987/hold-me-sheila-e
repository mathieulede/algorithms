I've tried so many times
To erase your memory from my mind
Yet it doesn't ever last for long

I see your picture
Then I hear your voice
Our love must be stronger than before

Every time I see your eyes
(Touch me)
Touch me
(Hold me)

Every time I hear your voice
(Touch me)
Hold me

Here I stand defenseless
As I look into your eyes
There's nothing left to say or do

You fill my head with promises
And all your pretty lies
Would it be so wrong to want you by my side?

Every time I see your eyes
(Touch me)
Touch me
(Hold me)

Every time I hear your voice
(Touch me)
Touch me
(Hold me)

I'm captured by my senses
Lost in your reverie
Our love must be stronger than before

Every time I see your eyes
(Touch me)
Oh, hold me, babe
(Hold me)

Every time I hear your voice
(Touch me)
Touch me
(Hold me)

Every time I see your eyes
(Touch me)
I wanna hold U, baby
(Hold me)
(Hold me, touch me, kiss me all over)

Every time I hear your voice
(Touch me)
Hold me
Kiss me all over
(Hold me)

Every time I see your eyes
(Touch me)
Kiss me, baby
(Hold me)
