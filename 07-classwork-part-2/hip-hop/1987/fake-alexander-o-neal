Your name was Patty
But now it's Kay

Girl
You seem to change it every day
Your hair was long
But now it's short

You say: I got it cut
But I don't see no hair upon the floor
Whenever I go out with you I find out something new

You're a fake
Baby
You can't conceal it

Know how I know
'cause I can feel it

You're a fake
Baby
No rhyme or reason

'Cause in your mind it's lyin' season

You had brown eyes
But now they're blue

Those false eyelashes that you're wearin'
Too
In bed this morning you called me CIyde

Alex is the name that I go by!
If women could be counterfit
Then you'd be it

You're a fake
Baby
You can't conceal it
. . 
You're a fake
Baby
I've blown your cover

The iig is up
'cause I discovered -
You're a fake
Baby
No need to hide it

Can't change my mind
'cause I've decided -
You're a fake
Baby
And I'm disgusted

The game is through and
Girl
You're busted
Fake!

Whenever I go out with you I find out something new
You're a fake
You always have a good excuse

But
Girl
That ain't no use
You're a fake
Baby
You can't conceal it
. . 
You're a fake
Baby
No rhyme or reason
. . 
You're a fake
Baby
Fake
Fake!
