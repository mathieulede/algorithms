They can take all my money
That won't bring me pain
The power of love inside me
Beats all material things

They can have all me possessions
And scandalize my name
I can handle all the pressure
If your love only stays the same

I don't wanna lose your love
'Cause you mean the world to me
I don't wanna lose your love
And all that we've come to be

As we lay here together
And I'm so into you
Nothing else could be better
Than the things that we do, no

Our love grows beyond measure
It flows endlessly
You give me so much pleasure
You're the only one I need

I don't wanna lose your love
'Cause you mean everythin' to me
See, I don't wanna lose your love
And all that we've come to be

See, I don't wanna lose your love
You mean everythin' to me
I don't wanna lose your love
And all that we've come to be

Oh, they can take all my money
I don't wanna lose it, I don't wanna lose it
I don't wanna lose it, I don't wanna, I don't wanna
I don't, I don't wanna lose your love

No, no, no, no, no, no, no my baby
They can scandalize my name
Take all my possessions
But I don't wanna lose your love

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You mean everythin' to me, I, I don't wanna, oh
They can scandalize my name, baby
Oh, everything brings me a little bit of pain
But I don't wanna lose your love
