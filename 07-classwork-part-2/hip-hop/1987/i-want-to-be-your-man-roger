Hey lady let me tell you why
Icant live my life without you,oh baby
Everytime I see you walking by i get a thrill
You dont notice me but in time you will,I must make you
Understand.....

Chorus:I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man (I do yeah,yeah)
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)
I wanna be your man (I wanna be your man)

Better not pass me by,cause if you do you'll lose a good
Thing,(oh baby)Cause what I got to say is sealed with a kiss
And a wedding ring(wedding ring)
My mind is blind at times

I can't see any one but you
Those other girls don't matter no they can't spoil my view
I must make you understand.....

Chorus:(2*)
Words can never say what I feel,(it's too intense)
Oh oh oh oh. I tried I tried I tried I tried to tell you
How I feel,but I get mixed up(soo mixed up)
My mind is blind at times I can't see anyone but you,those other
Girls dont matter no they can't spoil my view,I must make you
Understand.....

Chorus:repeat till song goes off
