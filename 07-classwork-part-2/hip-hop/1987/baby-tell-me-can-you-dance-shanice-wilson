[Verse 1:]
I see you in the corner
Staring in space
Acting like you're grooving
With the look upon your face

I see you smiling at me
You want to know my name
But if you wanna play, boy
You got to play my game

What I really want to know
Is can you dance

You're talkin' to your friends
About how good I look
Try to find a number
Always in the book

Before you come up to me
To tell me how you feel
I'm wiser than my years
So let me tell you what's the deal

What I really want to know
Is can you dance

[Chorus:]
Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Baby, tell me can you dance

[Verse 2:]
I just wanna party
That's what I'm here to do
I didn't come through to pick up
By the likes of you

I'll give you a chance
And one is all you get
If you think I'm sassy now, boy
You ain't seen nothing yet

What I really want to know
Is can you dance

(What I really want to know)
What I really want to know
Is can you dance, uh

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Bridge:]
I see you grooving hearty
Looks like you're havin' fun
But if you came to party
Start dancing on the one
Get up

If your dance is nothing
You don't need to be here
It ain't about the posing
But the sexy atmosphere
Get with it

You've got to start a fire
If you want to put one out
It's the groove that takes you higher
That's what dance is all about

Now I'm a busy person
No time for playin' games
But if I know you're serious
I'll tell you what's my name
Shanice

[Chorus:]
Can you dance
Can you dance
Can you dance
Whoa, can you dance
Tell me, tell me
Tell me can you dance

Can you dance
(Tell me can you)
Can you dance
(Dance)
