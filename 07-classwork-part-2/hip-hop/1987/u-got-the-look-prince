[Intro]
Here we are folks
The dream we all dream of
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love
Tell me, have you got the look'

[Verse 1]
You walked in, I woke up
I never seen a pretty girl
Look so tough, baby
You got that look
Color you peach and black
Color me takin' aback
Crucial, I think I wantcha

[Chorus]
You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's heck-a-slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look

[Verse 2]
Look here
You got the look (you got the look)
You must'a took (you must'a took)
A whole hour just to make up your face, baby
Closin' time, ugly lights, everybody's inspected (everybody's inspected)
But you are a natural beauty unaffected (unaffected)
Did I say an hour'
My face is red, I stand corrected (I stand corrected)

[Chorus]
You've got the look, you've got the hook
You sho'nuf do be cookin' in my book
Your face is jammin'
Your body's hecka slammin'
If love is good, let's get to rammin'
You got the look, you got the look
