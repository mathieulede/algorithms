[Verse 1]
Hard bodies
Soft emotions
So fast, so smart
The world at your feet
But what about your heart?
Fame and power can't hold you tight
In the weak [?] end of the night

[Chorus]
How do you stop (tell me)
Before it's too late?
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop (tell me)
Before it's too late?
You think love will wait
You don't hold on
And then it's gone[x2]

[Verse 2]
You've had some success
A new couple of friends
You're caught in the good life
You thought it would never, never end
One day then you're in your prime hands of time

[Bridge]
How do you stop
Before it's too late? (ooh)

[Chorus]
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
Before it's too late?

You don't hold on
And then it's gone

[Verse 3]
How do you stop, a runaway train?
How do you stop, the cold, cold rain?
How do you stop, love from leaving?
How do you stop

[Chorus]
How do you stop (how do you stop?)
Before it's too late? (how do you stop?)
How do you stop? (say it now!)
How do you stop? (say it again!)

[Chorus]
How do you stop (say it)
Before it's too late?
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate (hesitate)
How do you stop
Before it's too late?
