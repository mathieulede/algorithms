[Chorus 1: Marvin Winans & Anita Baker]
Ain't no need in worrying
What the night is gonna bring
It'll be all over in the morning
Ain't no need in worrying
What the night is gonna bring
It'll be all over in the morning

[Verse 1]
There's a fear of nightfall
When darkness comes and covers all, the day
Sometimes we feel pain
But there are things that we can change, just pray

[Chorus 2]
Ain't no need to worry
What the night is gonna bring
It'll be all over in the morning

[Verse 2]
Troubles come, but they do pass
Heartaches, hurts, oh but, they don't last always
Sometimes we feel pain
But there are things that we can change, just pray

[Chorus 2]
Ain't no need to worry
What the night is gonna bring
It'll be all over in the morning

[Bridge 2X]
In the morning, morning
It'll be all over in the morning

In the morning, (When I feel like I ain’t able) morning
Oh, I call, I call, I call, I call, I call, I call on Jesus, and He answered
Then I know…It'll be all over in the morning
(When I feel like I do evil, Lord, I call you, yes I do, yes I do, and you answer me) It'll be all over in the morning
(You tell me I belong to you) It’ll be all over in the morning
(Can’t nobody hurt me, can’t nobody touch me…)
It’ll be all over in the morning (You send your angels…)
It’ll be all over in the morning (...to keep a watch over me)

Vamp 2
Makes no difference how dark the night
If you trust in God, it'll be alright, come on
(It'll be all over in the morning)

Vamp 3
It makes no difference how long the day
Trust in God, He'll make a way
(It'll be all over in the morning)

Vamp 4
Weeping will last, but only for awhile
But when the sun shines, you'll wear a smile
(It'll be all over in the morning)

Vamp 5
And I say, thank you Jesus
In the presence of all those who hear my voice
They need to hear me today
(It'll be all over in the morning)

[Bridge 2X]
In the morning, morning
It'll be all over in the morning

(Sun’s gonna shine on your face)
It’ll be all over in the morning
(Make you feel like you, like you, you can run this race
And you can be the winner) It’ll be all over in the morning
(Take the prize and go home)
It’ll be all over in the morning
