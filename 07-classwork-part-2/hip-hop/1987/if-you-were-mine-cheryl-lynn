If this world were mine
I would place at your feet all that I own
You've been so good to me
If this world were mine

I'd give the flowers the birds and the bees
And it'd be your love beside me
That would be all I need

If this world were mine
I'd give anything

If this world were mine
I would make you a king with wealth untold
You could have anything
If this world were mine

I'd give your each day so sunny and blue
And if you wanted the moonlight
I'd give you that too

If this world were mine, oh, baby
I'd give you anything

Oh, baby, you're my inspiration
And there's no hesitation when you want me
Honey, just call me, oh

Oh, baby, you're my consolation
And I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms
When you squeeze me

Oh, the way that you do
Oh, the way that you love me, boy
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, the way that you do
Ooh, the way that you love me

Oh, oh, every sky will be blue
As long as your loving me, baby
(Ooh)
Whoa, whoa, ho, when I'm in your arms
Life is so wonderful, my love

Oh, oh, give me pretty lovin', baby
Give me pretty lovin', honey
Keep on lovin' me, baby
Whoa, oh, oh

You know I need you, honey
You know I need you, baby
Keep on loving me

Lovin' me the way you do
(The way you do, oh)
My love, I love the way that you, the way that you love me, baby
Oh and I don't wanna let you go, wanna let you
Wanna let you go, my love, no

I love the way, the way that you love me, baby
Mmm, ooh
You know
(Woo, hoo)

The world, the world would be yours
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, hea
(Mmm, hmm)

Yes, it would
(Yes, it would)
The world would be yours
(Yeah)

Baby
(Baby)
Ooh, hoo, it would be yours
If you'll believe
