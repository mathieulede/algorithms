It's been so many years since we've been together
And you promised me that you'd be mine forever
I put my trust in you whole heartedly
Now it seems that you wanna leave me

Tell me where? where did i go wrong?
I thought this love we had was very strong
Please don't make me beg you to stay
I'll always love you anyway

(i need you)
Need you
('cause i'm missing you)
'cause i'm missing you
(i'm missing you)

You see i

('cause i'm missing you)

We forget
('cause we forgot)

(the love we had before)
The love we had before
(doesn't exist no more)
Doesn't exist no more

(how soon we forget)
We forget
('cause we forgot)
'cause we forgot

(the love we had before)
I said the love we had before
(doesn't exist no more)

I toss and turn at night wondering what to do
You're like a stranger with a different attitude
So for the last time please don't make me beg you to stay
I know i'll always love you love you anyway

(i need you)
Need you
('cause i'm missing you)
'cause i'm missing you
(i'm missing you)
