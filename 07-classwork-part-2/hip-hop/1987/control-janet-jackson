[Intro]
This is a story about control
My control
Control of what I say
Control of what I do
And this time I'm gonna do it my way (my way)
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do
Are we ready?
I am
Cause it's all about control (control)
And I've got lots of it)

[Verse 1]
When I was 17 I did what people told me, uhh!
Did what my father said, and let my mother mold me
But that was long ago

[Chorus]
I'm in
Control
Never gonna stop
Control
To get what I want
Control
I like to have a lot
Control
Now I'm all grown up

[Verse 2]
First time I fell in love, I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive, I thought it would be easy
Now I know I got to take...

[Chorus]
Control
Now I got it locked
Control
To get what I want
Control
Never gonna stop
Control
Now I'm all grown up

[Interlude]
Jam, ooh ooh
Rebel, that's right
I'm on my own, I'll call my own shots
Thank you

[Bridge]
Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life, my life
I wanna be the one in control

[Verse 3]
So let me take you by the hand, and lead you in this dance
Control
It's what I got, because I took a chance
I don't wanna rule the world, just wanna run my life
Ooh
So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance just take

[Chorus]


[Interlude]
Ooh
Free at last
Out here on my own
Ooh ooh ooh yeah, eee
Now control this, uhh

[Chorus]
Control
That's right
Control
Career moves
Control
I do what's right for me
Control
And me wants to groove
Is that okay?

[Interlude]
Yeah!
Ooh, control

[Bridge 2]
I've got my own mind
Ooh baby
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I've got my own mind
Wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life
I wanna be the one in control

[Chorus]
Hop to it
I'm in control
And I love it
Hahaha, that's right
Control
Now I got a lot
Control
Now I'm all grown up

[Outro]
I'm in control
I'm in control
I'm in control
Don't make me lose it
