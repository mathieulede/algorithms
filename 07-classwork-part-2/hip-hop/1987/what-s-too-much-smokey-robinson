I could feel you the moment that you walked into the room
Oh baby, oh
What I felt I wondered if I felt too much too soon
I can't help myself, something draws me to you
How in just a moment's time can all of me pursue you

What's too much
When the fascination keeps on growing by the minute
What's too much
Should I hold back something or just throw my whole self in it
What's too much

Baby you touched me the moment that I looked into your eyes
Oh baby, baby baby
I was captured by the gaze that caught me by surprise
Oh baby, baby baby
I want to pay my full attention in advance
I don't know if that's too much but I'm willing to take the chance

What's too much
What's the feeling in it telling me, is there such a rule
What's too much
What's the fine line between a wise man and a fool
What's too much

You got something that makes me give it up
I want to give you everything but maybe that's too much
That's too much

What's too much
You got something that makes me give it up
I want to give you everything but maybe that's too much
What's too much
What's the feeling in it telling me, is there such a rule
What's too much
What's the fine line between a wise man and a fool
What's too much
'Cause I'm feeling something does anyone knows how to measure
What's too much
Should you try and stop it at a certain point of pleasure
What's too much
Tell me, tell me
What's too much
What's too much
What's too much
What's too much
