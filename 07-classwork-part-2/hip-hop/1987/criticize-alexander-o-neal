[Chorus]
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh
You don't realize
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize

[Verse 1]
Can't you find something else to talk about?
Is this song the only one you sing?
Makes you look better when you put things down?
Value your opinion

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't criticize my friends
Criticize my ideas
Don't criticize my life style
I'm fed up 'cause all you want to do is criticize

[Chorus]
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize yeah
You don't realize, all you want to do is criticize
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize

[Verse 2]
Now can't we talk this over?
Cause your conversation ain't right
We can make our love stronger
You don't have to think twice

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't criticize my friends
Criticize my ideas
Don't criticize my life style
I'm fed up 'cause all you want to do is criticize

[Chorus](till fade)
You've just closed your mind
Ooh ooh, criticize yeah
You don't realize, all you want to do is criticize
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize
