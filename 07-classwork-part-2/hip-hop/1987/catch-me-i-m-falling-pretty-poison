[Intro:]
Are you ready, boy?
Here I come
Catch me
I'm falling

[Verse 1:]
You came into my life
The look in your eyes took me by surprise
It's you and nobody else
Your love has made me so blind
I can't see

I am descending
From heaven above
So catch me
I'm falling, baby
Hold onto my love

[Chorus:]
Catch me
I'm falling
Catch me now
I'm falling

Catch me
I'm falling
Catch me now
I'm falling
Falling in love

[Verse 2:]
Two hearts beating in time
The rhythm as one
I am yours
You are mine

For you
I surrender myself
Each night
Every day
Always feeling this way

Falling in motion
As though I had wings
Your sweet love and devotion
Baby, it's magic
A magical thing

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Ooooh, baby
What can I do?
I'm falling for you

[Repeat Chorus:]
