When you look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
You're the object of my desire
My secret fantasy

I see the fire, I feel the flame
It gets me everytime you look my way
You know how it makes me feel inside
Come get me with your eyes

Dirty looks
You're giving them to me again
Dirty looks
I want you to
Just keep them coming
Dirty looks

I love it when you look at me like that, boy
Dirty

Every move you make boy
I'll be watching you
Can't wait 'till we're alone
'Cause you're love's so good

I see the fire, I feel the flame
It gets me everytime you look my way
You know how it makes me feel inside
Come get me with your eyes

Dirty looks
You're giving them to me again
Dirty looks
I want you to
Just keep them coming

You're so dirty

I see the fire, I feel the flame
It gets me everytime you look my way
You know how it makes me feel inside
Undress me with your eyes

Dirty looks
You're giving them to me again
Dirty looks
I want you to
Just keep them coming
