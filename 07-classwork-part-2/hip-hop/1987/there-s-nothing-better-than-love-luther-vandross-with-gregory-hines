(Luther)
I
Fell asleep late last night...
And I dreamed the night and almost half the day away...
I just got up
So that I can hear her say
She still in love
And no one can take her love away

(Gregory)

Oh love...
Wakes me up everyday
And I thought no one
Would ever make me feel this way
She fills me up
Everytime I hear her say...
She's still in love
And no one can take her love away

I wanna be loved...........

There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of....
No matter how far.........
Let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love........
To Love

(Luther)
And I
Mean all these words I say...
You don't have to guess
What's going on inside my head

(Gregory)

Try to know
All the tings that our hearts say...
Listen to love
And only let love lead the way

I wanna be loved...

There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of....
No matter how far.........
Let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love........

(For love)
(For love)

(Luther)
You know for love I would go anywhere....

(For love)

(Gregory)
I would go there.......

(For love)
(For love)

(Luther)
For love...
To the ends of nowhere

(Gregory)
And for her love

(And for her love)

(Both)
I would go
I would go
I.................
I would love
Would love
To just spend all my time

(Gregory)
With a girl
Who makes me feel her love is mine.....

(Luther)
Some one you see
Who would only dream of me...........
She be in love

(Cause she wants to be )
(She wants to be loved)

There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of....
No matter how far.........
Let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love........
To Love

Love....love

There's nothing better than love (oh oh oh........)
What in the world could you ever be thinking of.... (oh......)
No matter how far.........
Let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love........

There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of....
No matter how far.........
Let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love........(Fade)
