(I'm In Love)
Ooh, ooh, girl
Ooh, ooh, girl
I just met a lady that doesn't make me feel uptight
I'm so tired of dating, searching for Mrs. Right, yeah
Well, I found a girl that has some unneeded choice
I'm not gonna turn down a love that feels so real
She drives me crazy, she's the one for me
The finest love it could ever be
She proves it to me with a love so real
She won almost every heart
I don't want to be apart from her
Ooh
(I surrender)
I'm in love
Ooh
(I surrender)
All my love
Well, I know you've got it, everything that I want
I would feel so silly if ever I should let it go, can't let go
She gives me all I need, now my lady jives so fine
I'm not gonna turn down a love that feels so real
She drives me crazy, crazy, she's the one for me
The finest love that could ever be
She proves it with a love so real
She's won almost every heart
I don't want to be apart from her
