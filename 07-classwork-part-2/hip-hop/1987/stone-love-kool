Girl, the first time we met
You took me by surprise
Ooh, girl you walked into my life
With those street corner blues

You were livin' in the fast lane
Much to my surprise baby
But I fell for you, anyway
I'm addicted to your love girl, hey

Stone love (solid as a rock)
I'm in love with you baby, stone love
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, solid as a rock)

Girl, our love is so unique
It's one of a kind
And girl, whenever we kiss
It's like a natural high

But we're livin' in the fast lane
Red lights flashing baby
Will we ever change the way we are
Stone love girl, oh

Stone love
(Solid as a rock)
Stone Love
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, solid as a rock)

The life we live is a challenge, mmm
Always standing on the edge
May not be the best way but that's all we know
'Cause I don't wanna live my life alone, no

Oh, stone love baby, cause I've got you
Yes I've got you got you under my skin
Hey, stone love (solid as a rock)
That's the way we are, baby
Hey, stone love (solid as a rock)
May not be the best way but that's all we know
'Cause I don't wanna live my life alone, no

La, la, la, la stone love, stone love
You are everything I've ever wanted, baby
