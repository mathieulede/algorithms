[Verse 1:]
No one ever told me
A heart could ache as bad as mine
Boy, gotta tell ya
I thought that it would take my time

I thank you for the care
Now I know you're there for me
I tell you what I've found
Now you've come around for me

[Chorus]
Hey, if anybody loves you
Ooh, baby
I do you

If anybody loves you
Ooh, baby
I do you

[Verse 2:]
I may be sentimental
To fall for you again this way
But maybe you know better and
This time you're gonna stay

I thank you for the care
Now I know you're there for me, yeah
I tell you what I've found
Now you've come around for me

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
My heart
Take my heart from nothing
Turn it into something
You know I love you

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

I thank you for the care
Now I know you're there for me
I tell you what I've found
Now you've come around for me

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Hey
Anybody loves you
Anybody loves you
Ooh, baby
