Some times I feel you’re in love with me, baby
Other times I wonder, there’s no piece of mine, yeah
Uuh! I’d like to know what you feel for me, sugar
Its it really real or is it just a lie, yeah
I'd like to know, baby [I'd like to know]
Is there a chance for us
Or is this the end, baby [Is this the end]
Of our romance
I got the feeling it's over, don’t tell me it’s over
The funny feeling that it's over (no, no)
I got the feeling it's over
Oh, Lord! I hope am wrong
The funny feeling that it's over (well, well)
I thought we had
Such a love affair, baby
But I so wrong
Is it over now, over now
Tell me is there a chance for us
Or is this the end
I got the feeling it's over (I got the feeling, really, really got the feelin') (no, no)
The funny feeling that it's over now (I’m such a lonely man)
I got the feeling it's over (I got the feeling, really, really got the feelin')
Some times I can’t go on, no (The funny feeling that it's over now) hey!
[I got the feelin', really, really got the feelin' it’s over now] Hey! Yeah!
Tell me is there a chance for us
I got the feeling it's over (I got the feeling, really, really got the feelin') (no, no)
The funny feeling that it's over now (I’m such a lonely man)
I got the feeling it's over (I got the feeling, really, really got the feelin')
Some times I can’t go on, no (The funny feeling that it's over now) hey!
I got the feeling it's over (I got the feeling, really, really got the feelin')
I thought you were my girl
Then you came and rocked my world, well, well
Our love was right on time
Now you've gone and blown my mind, yeah
Woo...ooh...
Hey, hey, hey, hey
