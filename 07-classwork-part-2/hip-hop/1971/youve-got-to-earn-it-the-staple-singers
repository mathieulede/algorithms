To get stones from a rock
You've got to break it
To get bread from dough
You've got to bake it

To get water from a faucet
You've got to turn it
If you wanna be loved
If you wanna be loved
(If you want to be loved)
You've got to earn it

To get fire from matches
You've got to strike them
To get the feeling like this
You've got to like it

To get ashes from wood
You've got to burn it
If you wanna be loved
If you wanna be loved
Ooh, you've got to earn it

Throw hate right out of your heart

To make broken things work
You've got to fix 'em
That's what you gotta do, now
To make two things one
You've got to mix them, yeah

To get butter from milk
You've got to churn it
If you wanna be loved
If you wanna be loved
Said y'all
You've got to earn it

Earn it, earn it
Earn it, earn it
That's what you gott do, now
Earn it, earn it
Earn it, earn it
Earn the right to be loved
Earn it, earn it
