[Refrain]
Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood
Get down, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Get down, baby
After life and desire there is nothing left

[Verse 1]
We're all children of the world
A hungry man in search for a hungry girl
It's strange, so plain we're all cannibal
The most wasted and two faced of all animals

[Break]
Get down, get down
Get down, get down

[Refrain]
Take my soul, baby
When you reel I can feel so much desire
Take my soul, baby
Life unfolds from my soul when you start a fire

[Break]
So get down, just get down

[Refrain]
Get down, baby
As the rhythm should follow through your able soul
Get down, baby
Play the part like a pro in a perfect role
Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood

[Verse 2]
One can never point out the actual path
Of the mysterious need in a female's heart
Man can only follow not knowing how
His faith might erupt, and his only proud

[Break]
So get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down

[Refrain]
Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural move
Take my soul, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Take my soul, baby
After life and desire there is nothing left

[Break]
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
