All I have
Left in my heart
Is my love for you

Romance is over and through (Romance)
No longer and I supposed to think of you
Or of memories of happier times
When darling, I was yours and you were mine
'Cause now you ask me girl to give you back

All that I have
Ooh, baby
All that I have

And all I have
Left in my heart
Is my love for you

How can you
Have the nerve to say
Go and find (Go and find) someone ne&119

Sorry, sorry it has to end this way (To end)
But I don't think that I could have gone through another day
Of knowing you don't want me around
And knowing of this new love you've found
'Cause now you ask me, girl, to give you back

All that I have
Ooh, baby

And all I have
Left in my heart
Is my love (Is my love) for you

And how can you
Have the nerve to say
Go and find (Go and find) someone new

Darling
If this is what you really want me to do
Then I'll go out and try
To find someone new
