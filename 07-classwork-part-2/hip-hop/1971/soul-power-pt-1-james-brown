Know we need it
(Soul power)
We got to have it
(Soul power)
Know we want it
(Soul power)
Got to have it
(Soul power)
Give it to me
(Soul power)
Hey, you need it
(Soul power)
We want it
(Soul power)
Got to have it
(Soul power)
I wanna get
Under your skin
If I get there
I got to win
You need some soul
Come on and get some
And then you'll know
Where I'm coming from
A man, a man
Unaccompanied can go along
But I'm still on the case
And my rap is strong
Go jump on my train
When I'm outta sight
Just check yourself and say
Yeah, you're right
Hey, hit me
Give it, put it there
Love me tender
Said love me slow
If that don't get it
Go back for more
Love me tender
Love me slow
If that don't get it
Go back for more
Lookie here, you gotta get
In the bracket
You know that I like it
All right
Lookie, all right
A ball on the ground
You gotta get down
Down, down, down, down
A ball on the ground
You gotta get down
Down, down, down, down
Good God
I got the attitude
What you need
(Soul power)
What we want
(Soul power)
I have (soul power)
What we want
(Soul power)
What we missing
(Soul power)
What we missing
(Soul power)
What we want
(Soul power)
What we need
(Soul power)
Hit me
Love me tender
Love me slow
I don't care if you
Come back for more
