I'm spinning around and around ooh
I'm walking on cloud nine
I'm just about to blow my cool
If I don't unwind

I'm spinning around
Spinning around
Spinning around
Spinning around
I must be falling in love
Baby
I must be falling in love
'Round and around and around

I'm spinning around I can't stop
I've lost my self-control
I'm spinning around 'til I drop
I'm whipped down to the soul

I'm spinning around
Spinning around
Spinning around
Spinning around
I must be falling in love
Baby
I must be falling in love

Turning around
I'm upside-down
Like a feather swift
The wind will blow my mind
The wind will blow my mind
Won't let me stop

Spinning around
Spinning around
Spinning around
Spinning around
I must be falling in love
Baby
I must be falling in love
I'm falling
I must be falling in love
Baby
I must be falling in love
