[Verse 1]
Mercy, mercy me
Things aren't what they used to be, no no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east

[Verse 2]
Mercy, mercy me
Things aren't what they used to be, no no
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury

[Verse 3]
Mercy, mercy me
Things aren't what they used to be, no no
Radiation under ground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying

[Verse 4]
Mercy, mercy me
Things aren't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
