And then we'll
Walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
Walk right up to the sun
We won't fear anyone

I'll pull the moon
Out of the sky for you
If you promise me
A love that's true

I'll change the world
From old to new
Love was made just for two

And then we'll
Walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
Walk right up to the sun
We won't fear anyone

I'll take a rainbow
From the sky for you
If one's not good enough
I'll bring you two

I'll change the skies
From gray to blue
Love was made just for two

And then we'll
Walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
Walk right up to the sun
We won't fear anyone

Listen, baby

Change the world
From old to new
Love was made just for two

And then we'll
Walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
Walk right up to the sun
We won't fear

Walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
Walk right up to the sun
We won't fear

Walk right up to the sun
