The touch of you
(Baby, baby, the touch of you)
Is drivin' me out of my head, oh boy
(Baby, baby, out of my head)

What a touch from a little hand can do
(Can do)
Especially coming from you
Turn my life all around
I can't seem to settle down
Oh, baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

The touch of you
(Baby, baby, the touch of you)
Is drivin' me out of my head, oh boy
(Baby, baby, out of my head)

The touch of you
(Baby, baby, the touch of you)
Is drivin' me out of my head, oh boy
(Baby, baby, out of my head)

I'm hooked on you and I can't help myself
(Can't help myself)
There's just no time for anything else
(Anything else)

You're all I want and all I need
I will follow if you will lead
Oh, baby, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

(Baby, baby, the touch of you)
Is drivin' me out of my head, oh boy
(Baby, baby, out of my head)

Baby, baby, baby, the touch of you
(Baby, baby, the touch of you)
Is drivin' me out of my head, oh boy
(Baby, baby, out of my head)

Baby, baby, baby
