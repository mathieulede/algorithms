Mmm, sweet Lord
My sweet Lord
Mmm, my Lord
Sweet, sweet Lord

[Chorus]
I really want to see you
I really want to be with you
I really want to see you Lord
But it takes so long, oh Lord

My sweet Lord
My, my, good Lord
Wonderful Lord

I really want to know you Lord
(Hallelujah)
I really want to go with you
(Hallelujah)
I really want to show you Lord
That it won't take long, oh Lord
(Hallelujah)

My sweet Lord
My good Lord
Wonderful Lord

I really want to see you Lord
(Hallelujah)
I really want to see you
(Hallelujah)
I really want to see you
(Hallelujah)
I really want to see you Lord
But it takes so long, oh Lord
(Hallelujah) X 4

I really want to hear you Lord
I want to be near to you
(Hare Krishna)
I want to be near you Lord
Like I won't be [through?] Oh Lord
(Hallelujah)

My, my, my, my Lord

'Cos you're so good, my Lord
(Hallelujah)

My Lord
My, my, my Lord
Sweet, sweet, sweet Lord

My, my, my Lord
(Hallelujah)
My, my, my, my Lord

My, my, my, sweet Lord
(Hallelujah)
I really want to her you Lord
