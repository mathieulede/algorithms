Who's the black private dick
That's a sex machine to all the chicks?
(Shaft) Ya damn right

Who is the man that would risk his neck
For his brother man?
(Shaft) Can you dig it?

Who's the cat that won't cop out
When there's danger all about?
(Shaft) Right on

They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother - (Shut your mouth)
But I'm talkin' 'bout Shaft - (Then we can dig it)

He's a complicated man
But no one understands him but his woman
(John Shaft)
