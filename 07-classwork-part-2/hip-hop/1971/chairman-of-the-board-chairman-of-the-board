Don't ask
They've been keeping secrets, we've been sleeping fast
You don't show
That glimmer in your eye, unless you've got someone to blow

Working overtime
By your own design
You cheat, you steal, you climb

Hey, yeah you won at the see-saw
Got the attention now you're chairman of the board
Hey, but you're losing friends cause
You lost their patience, nobody want to know

Don't smile
They've been keeping tabs, your dance moves are on file
So right or wrong??
Self-made & you're pround, you keep the repetition strong

Working overtime
By Your own Design
You cheat, you steal, you climb

Hey, yeah you won at the see-saw
Got the attention now you're chairman of the board
Hey, but you're losing friends cause
You lost their patience, nobody want to know

Hey, yeah you won at the see-saw
Got the attention now you're chairman of the board
Hey, but you're losing friends cause
You're out of time, out of time
