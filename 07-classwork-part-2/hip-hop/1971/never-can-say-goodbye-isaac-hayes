[Hook]
I never can say goodbye
I never can say goodbye

[Verse 1]
Even though the pain and heartache seem to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings they always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me and I always have to say no

[Hook]
Tell me why is it so
That I never can say goodbye
I never can say goodbye

[Verse 2]
Every time I think I've had enough and start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration piercin' me right to the core
It says, "Turn around you fool, you know you love her more and more"

[Hook]
Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go
I can't say goodbye
I never say goodbye

I never can say goodbye
I never can say goodbye

[Verse 3]
I keep thinkin' that our problems soon are gonna work all out
But there's that same unhappy feeling that makes that anguish twist and doubt
It's the same old did ya hang up, can't do with you or without

[Hook]
Tell me why is it so
I don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye
I, I never say goodbye

I never can say goodbye girl
I never can say goodbye
Don't wanna let you go
I can't say goodbye
Ya see, I need you so
I never can say goodbye
I never can say goodbye
Oh baby, I never can say goodbye
I can't say goodbye
Kick it, out of my mind yeah
I never can say goodbye
I want you all the time
I can't say goodbye
You're my one and only lover
I never can say goodbye
Don't wanna tell her
I just say goodbye
