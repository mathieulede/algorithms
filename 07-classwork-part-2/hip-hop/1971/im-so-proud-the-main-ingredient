You're prettier than all the world
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
'Cause you're only one fellow's girl
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
Yes baby, I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
Compliments to you from all the people we meet
Yes baby, I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue
Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
Yes baby, I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you
I'm so proud, proud of you, honey
I'm so proud, proud of you, baby
I'm so proud....
