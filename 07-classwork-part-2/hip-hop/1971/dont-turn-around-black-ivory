(Don't walk away)
I never meant to hurt you
& you always said you'd be my fool
(Now that it's done)
Believe me, girl, I'm sorry
& you know I'll make it up to you
So
Don't turn around
'Cause nothing in the past will change
Don't turn around
Let's look ahead & always stay
Together, forever
(It's always hard)
Hard to love the one that hurts you
& forgive them for the wrong they do
(But give me a chance)
This time I swear I'll be true
No one will keep me away
From you
Don't turn around
'Cause nothing in the past will change
Don't turn around
Let's look ahead & always stay
Together, forever
