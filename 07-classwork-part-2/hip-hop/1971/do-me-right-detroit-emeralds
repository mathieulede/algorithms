Do me right
I'll do you no wrong
Do me good
I'll do you no harm, girl
Ooh

Ain't gonna put you down
Just let me hang around
If you've got a dollar bill
And I got a dime, girl
Just remember, baby
Sure enough now
What's yours is mine

Take me to the dealer
Buy me an automobile
I'll drive you to a restaurant
Buy you a good, full meal
Ain't gonna make you mad
Gonna be the best man
You ever had
(Do me right)

Do me right, baby
I'll do you no wrong, girl
Do me good, yeah
I'll do you no harm

Take you to the shopping center
Buy you a brand new dress
And that ain't all now, baby
Gonna buy you a washing machine
And ironing board so you can
Keep your new dress pressed, girl

Ooh
I'm gonna keep you fine
I got to make you mine, mine
Mine, mine
All mine

I'll do you no wrong, yeah
Do me good
I'll do you no harm
