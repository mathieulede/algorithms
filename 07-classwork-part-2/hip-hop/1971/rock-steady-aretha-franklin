[Verse 1]
Rock steady baby!
That's what I feel now
Let's call this song exactly what it is
Step and move your hips
With a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car
And take a ride
And while you are moving
Rock steady
Rock steady baby
Let's call this song exactly what it is
(What it is -what it is - what it is)

[Chorus]
It's a funky and low down feeling'
(What it is)
In my hips from left to right
(What it is)
What it is
Is I might be doing
(What it is)
This funky dance all night
Oh!
(Let me hear ya gotta feeling in the air)
Oh!
(Gotta a feeling an ain't got a care)
Oh!
(What fun to take this ride
Rock steady will only slide)

[Bridge]
Rock steady........ rock steady baby
Rock steady........ rock steady baby

[Verse 2]
Step and move your hips
With a feeling from side to side
Sit yourself down in your car
And take a ride
While you are moving rock steady
Rock steady

[Bridge]
Let's call this song exactly what it is

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Rock steady baby
Rock steady... woo!
Rock steady
(Rock.... steady!... rock... steady!)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Rock steady
Steady it baby!
Rock....rock steady baby

[Outro]
Baby
(What it is)
Baby baby
(What it is)
Baby
(What it is)
Baby...
