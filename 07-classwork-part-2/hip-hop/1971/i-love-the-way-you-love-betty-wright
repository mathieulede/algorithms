I love the way you love baby
La La La La La La
I love the way you love baby
La La La La La La

Come on and thrill me baby
Oooh you don't know what you're doing
Comme on and thrill me baby
Ease all my pain and my misery

Bring so much too into my world
Just like you'd do to a baby girl

Let me hold you Baby
'Till that old clock on the wall strikes two
Just let me hold you baby
'Till that old clock on the wall strikes two

If you be good to me
Love knows I'll be good to you

I love the way you love baby
La La La La La La
I love the way you love baby
La La La La La La

All right yeah
You've got the power baby
And I think I better not go wood
You've got the power baby
And I think I better not go wood

In all the days of my life I ain't never ver felt so good

I love the way you love baby
La La La La La La
I love the way you love baby
La La La La La La
