Baby, let me do it, let me do it to you
Let me kiss you, baby
Baby, can I do it, can I do it to you
Can I kiss you, baby?
Cause baby, you're giving me such a groovy sensation
But don't stop it now, baby - I might lose your vibration
Your sweet conversation, it keeps turning me on, yeah
My mind is so weak girl, all my resistance is gone
Now you know you got me in a bad situation
You keep it up, baby, I might lose my reputation

Baby, let me do it, let me do it to you
Let me kiss you, baby
Baby, can I do it, can I do it to you
Can I kiss you, baby?
Baby, let me do it now, cause I'm bout to do it anyhow
You know you got, baby, oh, what I want now
But every time I want to, you tell me don't
Don't do this, now you say I can't do that
Come on, baby - girl, how you gonna act?

So baby, let me do it, let me do it to you
Let me kiss you, baby
Baby, can I do it, can I do it to you
Can I kiss you, baby?
Good God...
You're looking good, just like I thought you would
So come on, baby - let me kiss you just-a one time
I think I might kiss you one, two times
You're looking good now, feeling good
You got me going down, round and round
Up and down, baby, feeling good, now
Come on, baby - Good God...

Baby, let me do it, let me do it to you
Let me kiss you, baby
