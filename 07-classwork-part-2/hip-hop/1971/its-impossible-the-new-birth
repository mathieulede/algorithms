Impossible, ooh impossible

It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky
It's just impossible
(It's impossible)
It's impossible, ask a baby not to cry
It's just impossible

Oh, can I hold you, closer, closer to me, baby
And not feel you, going through me
Split the second, honey, that I never, never think of you
Oh, how impossible, oh ho, oh ho, ooh

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore
It's just impossible
(It's impossible)
If I had you could I ever want for more
It's just impossible

Oh, and tomorrow should you ask me for the world
Somehow I'd get it, baby, I'd sell my very soul
I won't regret it, no, no, for to live without your love
Oh, it just ain't no way, oh no, oh no baby
No no no no no no no

Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
It's just impossible
(It's impossible)
If I had you could I ever want for more
It's just impossible

Oh, and tomorrow should you ask me for the world
Somehow I'd get it, baby I would sell my very soul
I won't regret it, no, no, for to live without your love
Oh, it just ain't no way

Impossible, ooh impossible
Impossible, ooh impossible
Impossible, ooh impossible
