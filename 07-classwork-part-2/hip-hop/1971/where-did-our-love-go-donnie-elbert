Baby, baby, baby, don't leave me
Oh, please don't leave me all by myself

I've got this burnin', burnin', yearnin' feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me and it hurts so bad

You came into my heart (baby, baby) so tenderly
With a burnin' love (baby, baby) that stings like a bee
(Baby, baby)

Now that I surrender (baby, baby) so helplessly
You now wanna leave (baby, baby), ooh, you wanna leave me
(Baby, baby)

Ooh, baby, baby, baby, where did our love go?
Oh, don't you want me (baby, baby), don't you want me no more?
(Baby, baby)
Ooh, baby

INSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE

Baby, baby, where did our love go?
And all your promises (baby, baby) of a love forever more?
(Baby, baby)

I've got this burnin', burnin', yearnin' feelin' inside me
Ooh, deep inside me (baby, baby) and it hurts so bad
(Baby, baby)

Before you won my heart (baby, baby) you were a perfect guy
But now that you got me (baby, baby) you wanna leave me behind
(Baby, baby)

Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby, don't leave me
Oh, please don't leave me (baby, baby) all by myself
(Baby, baby)

Ooh (baby, baby), baby, baby, where did our love go?
(Fade out)
