Little girl, please stop your crying
'Cause I'll erase away your pain
You're the only girl in town
Who always get pushed around

So girl, don't change (don't change)
Don't let yourself go, girl
Don't change (don't change)
'Cause I love you just the way you are

So little girl, please stop your running
'Cause I'll erase away whoooo your pain
(I'll erase away ) your pain
(I'll erase away )

Just be true to only me
Tell me you're as happy
As a girl can be

So girl, don't change (don't change)
Don't let yourself go, girl
Don't change (don't change)
'Cause I love you just the way you are

So little girl, please stop your running
'Cause I'll erase away whoooo your pain
(I'll erase away ) your pain
(I'll erase away ) your pain
(I'll erase away ) your pain
