Someday I'm gonna be happy
You just wait and see
Some people don't see the dark baby
Like you do me
One day my day will come
And you'll be the lonely one
But until then, I'll suffer
(Until then) I'll suffer

(Until then) I'll suffer
(Until then) I'll suffer

But one thing I can say
I've been a good woman
I've done everything for you
Now I'm tired up my doing
One day my day will come
And you will be the lonely one
But until then, I'll suffer
(Until then) I'll suffer
(Until then) I'll suffer
(Until then) I'll suffer

But one thing for sure
You can't say I didn't try
So honey, I think I'll, I think I'll sit it out
Until, until I can do better
I have to think what I can get
All of our friends tell me
They say, it's you that I should have forget

One day my day will come
And you'll be the lonely one
But until then, I'll suffer
(Until then), I'll suffer
(Until then), I'll suffer
(Until then), I'll suffer
Baby, I'll suffer
Oh yeah, for you
(Until then) I'll suffer
(Until then) I'll suffer
