The lady smiled at me
When she asked about the
Possibility that we might
Spend some time alone

And, oh, the thoughts
That filled my head
When she looked in my eyes
And slowly said

Do you wanna get funky with me
Do you wanna, whoa

The idle mind is a
Playground for the devil
Do you wanna get funky with me
Do you wanna

(Do you wanna get funky)
(Do you wanna get funky)
(Do you wanna get funky)
(Do you wanna get funky)
(Do you wanna get funky)
(Do you wanna get funky)

The way she spoke to me
Told me I had the opportunity
To see how funky she could be

And when I looked into her eyes
The fire they held made me realize
The flame was burning just for me

The lady tempted me
I closed my eyes
It was plain to see
She was the devil in disguise

And, oh, the message she'd relay
When she would take my hand and say
Do you wanna get funky with me
Do you wanna

The idle mind is a
Playground for the devil
Do you wanna get funky with me
Do you wanna

I wanna set you on fire
'Cause it's hot
'Cause it's hot
I wanna set you on fire
'Cause it's hot
'Cause it's hot
I wanna set you on fire
'Cause it's hot
'Cause it's hot
I wanna set you on fire
'Cause it's hot
'Cause it's hot
I wanna set you on fire
'Cause it's hot
'Cause it's hot

(It's so hot
I'm burning up)...
Oh, no, no, no

I wanna set you on fire
'Cause it's hot
'Cause it's hot
'Cause it's hot

I felt the heat within
The lust of love
And the urge to sin
I felt her reaching for my soul

And then I knew I had no choice
But to heed the command
Of the devil's voice

Do you wanna get funky with me
Do you wanna, do you wanna
Do you wanna

The idle mind is a
Playground for the devil
Do you wanna get funky with me
Do you wanna get funky
Do you wanna get funky with me
Do you wanna

The idle mind is a
Playground for the devil

Do you wanna get funky with me
Do you wanna
Do you wanna get funky with me
