If it's the last thing I do
I'll make you mine

But baby
The first thing is you
In my design

Ohh
And just like the stars guard the moon
Way up above me...

Hey baby
That's just how I'll guard our love
So love me
Come one, please love me

Well...
If it's the last thing I do
I'm gonna take your hand...

And though I won't say one word
I know you'll understand, yeah&46

And I'll build a dream
Just for two
And then I'll make it come true
Baby, if it's the very, very last thing that I do
I'm gonna get you, yeah

Well, well, well, well
I'll build a dream
Just for two
And then I'll make sure it comes true

Baby, if it's the very, very last thing
That I might do
While I'm down here on this Earth
I'lll?

Baby, if I just had you, yeah
I could be so happy
And I know I could make you happy

So I'm gonna take your hand
And baby, I'm sure you'll understand, yeah

If it's the last thing I do
I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna make you mine...
