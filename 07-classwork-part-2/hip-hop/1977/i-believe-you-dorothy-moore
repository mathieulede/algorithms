I believe you

I believe you when you say that you will reach into the sky
And steal a star so you can put it on my finger
I believe you
Oo woo baby, I believe you

I believe you when you tell me every
Time that we make love will be
The first time we've made love
And every act of love will please you
Oo woo baby, I believe

Blind faith makes me follow you
I'd live in a cave if you wanted to
Just ask me and I'll marry you
You don't have to sell me
Cause you overwhelm me
I've made up my mind
For a life time

I believe you when you say
You'll fill my body with your soul
And love will grow into a brown-eyed
Little girl who looks like we do
Oo woo baby, I believe you

I believe you when you say
You'll fill my body with your soul
And love will grow into a brown-eyed
Little girl who looks like we do
Oo woo baby, I believe you

I believe you when you swear your love
Will keep on growin' strong
And that forever isn't long enough to
Love me like you need to
Oo woo baby, I believe you
Oo woo baby, I believe you
Oo woo honey, I love you
