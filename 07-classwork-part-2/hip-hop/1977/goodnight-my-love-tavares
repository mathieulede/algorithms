Goodnight My Love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
Before you go, please be honest
(Please remember)
I need you
And this love that I have for you
Will never grow cold
If you should wake, in the still of the night
Please have no fear for I'll be there
You know I care
Please give your love to me dear, only
Goodnight My Love
Pleasant dreams, sleep tight my love
May tomorrow be sunny and bright
And bring you closer to me
Before you go, please remember
I need you so
And this love that I have for you
Will never grow cold
Goodnight...
