[Intro]
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burn baby burn
Burning

[Verse 1]
To my surprise - listen - one hundred stories high
People getting loose y'all, getting down on the roof, do you hear?
The funk was flaming, out of control
It was so entertaining, when the boogie started to explode

[Hook]
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burning

[Verse 2]
Satisfaction, came in the chain reaction
I couldn't get enough, 'till I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody's going strong, and that is when my spark got hot

[Hook]
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burning

[Bridge]
Up above my head, I hear music in the air
That makes me know there's somebody somewhere

[Verse 3]
Satisfaction, came in a chain reaction, do you hear?
I couldn't get enough, so I had to self-destruct
The heat was on, rising to the top
Everybody's going strong, that is when my spark got hot

[Hook]
I heard somebody say
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burn baby burn, disco inferno
Burn baby burn, burn the mother down
Burning
