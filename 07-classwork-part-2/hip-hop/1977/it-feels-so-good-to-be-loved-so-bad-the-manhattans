Ohh baby the more I love you
The more I want to love you
Cause loving you is all that is on my mind
I wish I can be with you
Forever and ever

Ohh baby, well loving you is all thats on my mind
(yes it is)
I want you, I want you, I want you
I want to have you one more time
You've got it easy way of loving and
It's the best that I ever had (well, well)
And it feels, it feels so good to be loved so bad
Ohh baby yeah needing you is
More is all I can take (yes it is)
C'mon and hold me, touch me, feel me
Do it to me once again

You feel me with desire and it's all
Going to drive me mad
It feels, it feels so good to be loved so bad

Do you feel it are you ready ( are you ready)
Hold on steady, ohh hold on steady
Here we go, here we go again, now
Move a little bit closer
C'mon and follow me to estacy

Oh girl can't believe the way we flow
I want to love you, love you
I don't ever want to let you go
Now you've got me where you want me
And it makes me feel glad
'Cuz it feels, it feels so good to be loved so bad
Loving you is all that's on my mind
I want to have you just one more chance
