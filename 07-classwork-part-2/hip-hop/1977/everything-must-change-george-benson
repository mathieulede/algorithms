Um hmm, um hmm hmm
Everyone will change
Everything will change

Everything must change
Nothing stays the same, no no
Everyone must change
Nothing stays the same

Young become the old
Mysteries do unfold
‘Cause that’s the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in live
You can be sure of, ooh , except
Rain comes from the clouds
And sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

Winter turns to spring
Wounded heart will heal, yes it will
But never much too soon
Everything must change

The young become the old
Mysteries do unfold
‘Cause that’s the way of time
Nothing and no one goes unchanged

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of, ooh hoo, except
Rain comes from the clouds
And sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds do fly

(Instrumental)

There are not many things in life
You can be sure of, ooh, except
Rain comes from the clouds
And sun lights up the sky
And hummingbirds to fly, ooh
Rain comes from the clouds

(Guitar and scat solo)
