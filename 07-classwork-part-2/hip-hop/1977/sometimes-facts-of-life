Mother cries herself to sleep
For a love she couldn't keep
Sweetest dreams at night reminding her
Of how it used to be

Father looks the other way
Plays it cool, come what may
Though the facts of life surrounding him
Forever he will stray

And her eyes tell a thousand stories
And her smile makes flowers bloom
She's like poetry in motion
She brightens up the room

Sometimes
She feels homeless in her heart
Sometimes
Looking for a brand new start
Sometimes
She feels homeless in her heart
Sometimes

Fell in love that special night
Chose the hard way, chose to fight
For the one who sings her songs
Holds her 'till the morning light

And her eyes tell a thousand stories
And her smile makes flowers bloom
She's like poetry in motion
She brightens up the room

Sometimes
She feels homeless in her heart
Sometimes
Looking for a brand new start
Sometimes
She feels homeless in her heart
Sometimes

Sometimes
She feels homeless in her heart
Sometimes
Looking for a brand new start
Sometimes
She feels homeless in her heart
Sometimes
