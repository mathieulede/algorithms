[Verse 1]
Doesn't take much to make me happy
And make me smile with glee
Never never will I feel discouraged
Cause our love's no mystery
Demonstrating love and affection
That you give so openly yeah
I like the way ya make me feel
About you baby
Want the whole wide world to see

[Hook] x4
Whoa whoa, you got the best of my love



Goin' in and out of changes
The kind that come around each day
My life has a better meaning
Love has kissed me in a beautiful way
And oh yea (my love, my love)
Oh yea (my love, my love)
Oh you got the best of my love!


[Hook] x3



Demonstrating sweet love and affection
That you give so openly yeah
The way I feel about ya baby can't explain it
Want the whole wide world to see
Ohhh but in my heart
You're all I need
You for me and me for you
Ohhh, it's growin' every day ooooh
Ohhh, oh oh oh oh oh
