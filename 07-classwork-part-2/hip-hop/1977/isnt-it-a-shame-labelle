How is it that two people
Who laughed together and loved together
Sometimes end up far apart?
(Tell me how is it?)

And how is it that two people
Who cry together, wanna die together
Sometimes end up with a broken heart?

Isn't it a shame
(Isn't it a shame, my friend)
Sometimes such a love?
(Sometimes such a love such as this must leave?)
Isn't it a shame
(Isn't it a shame, you have to laugh before you cry?)

And how is it that two people
Who cling together wanna dream, dream together
(Cling together wanna have a little dream together)
Oh, they end up alone?
(Tell me how is it?)

And how is it that two people
Who plan together, make a little life together
Sometimes end up along that road?

Isn't it a shame?
(Isn't it a shame, my friend?)
Sometimes such a love
(Sometimes such a love such as this is must leave)

Isn't it a shame?
(Baby, you have to laugh before you)
Isn't it a shame that such a love must leave?
(You'll have to laugh before you cry)

Isn't it a shame?
Sometimes such a love
Isn't it a shame?
Isn't it a shame that such a love must leave?

Isn't it a shame?
Sometimes such a love
Isn't it a shame?
You have to laugh before you cry

Baby, look, shame
Oh, you gotta laugh before you
Isn't it a shame
That such a love must leave?

Isn't it a shame
Sometimes such a love?
Isn't it a shame
(You have to laugh before you cry, cry, cry)
Isn't it a shame that such a love must leave, woah?

Isn't it a shame, my friend
Sometimes such a love?
Isn't it a shame, isn't it a shame
That such a love must leave, woah?

And how is it that two people
Who live together, dream, dream together
Sometimes end up all alone?
(Tell me how is it?)

I said how is it again that two people
Cling together, dream, dream together
(Cling together, wanna build a little dream together)
Sometimes end up all alone?

Isn't it a shame, my friend
Sometimes such a love?
Isn't it a shame, isn't it a shame
That such a love must leave?

Isn't it a shame
Sometimes such a love?
Isn't it a shame, isn't it a shame
That such a love must leave?

Isn't it a shame
Sometimes such a love?
Isn't it a shame, isn't it a shame?
(Such a love must leave)
