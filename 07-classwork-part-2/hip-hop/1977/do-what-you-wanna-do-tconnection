Everybody's startin' to pick on you
Just can't let them tell you what to do

You've only got one life
So live it cool
In this world of ?
You can't be a fool

[Chorus]
Don't let nobody tell ya what to do
You gotta be your judge and jury too
Don't let nobody tell ya what to do
You gotta be your judge and jury too

All right

Gotta do your thing
And let it all hang out
Gotta really show them
What you're all about

Move on up
Don't look around
People always try to put you down, down

[Chorus]
?
?
Yeah, yeah
Do what you wanna do
Oh yeah
Judge and the jury too
I'm gonna do
I'm gonna do

Do what you wanna do
I'm gonna do, yeah
Judge and the jury too
I'm gonna do, yeah
Do what you wanna do
Judge and the jury too

I'm gonna do, yeah
Judge and the jury too
