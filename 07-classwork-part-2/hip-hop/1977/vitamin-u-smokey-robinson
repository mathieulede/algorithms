Since you went away from me, I've got a love deficiency

Tried vitamin A, and you went away
Vitamin b to bring you back to me
Vitamin C for all the nights I cried
Vitamin D to dry my eyes
I tried all them now I see, the only one that's gonna work for me
Is vitamin U girl, to see me though girl

Thought if I could find another lover, With some tender care baby I'd soon recover
But like useless remedies, they couldn't satisfy my need

Tried vitamin A, and you went away
Vitamin b to bring you back to me
Vitamin C for all the nights I cried
Vitamin D to dry my eyes
I tried all them now I see
The only one that's gonna work for me
Is Vitamin U girl, to see me though girl

Your my weakness, I need a does of you sweetness
Girl my strength is fading, and my heart is ailing

Tried vitamin A, and you went away
Vitamin b to bring you back to me
Vitamin C for all the nights I cried
Vitamin D to dry my eyes
I tried all them now I see, the only one that's gonna work for me
Is Vitamin U girl, I need some Vitamin U girl
Vitamin U girl, I need some multivitamin U girl

I need you to see me though, to see me thought girl
I need you to see me though, I need you too see me thought

Oh baby what you did for me
Strengthen my eyes, and help me see
