[Intro]
The whole town's laughing at me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I had your love right here in the palm of my hands
And I lost it and I lost it
Had a love so new, one a man can feel
And I lost it and I lost it

[Hook]
Maybe if I had spent more time with you
Maybe then, maybe then you'd still be mine
Oh and only if I had been just a little more kind to you
There'd be no need, for this man to be cryin'

The whole town's laughing at me
Silly fool, how'd you lose such a good friend?

[Verse 2]
Had my dream so near, I could reach out and touch it
And I lost it, and I lost it
Had a world complete, it was, oh, so sweet
And I lost it, and I lost it

[Hook]
Maybe if I had spent just a little more time with you
Maybe then, maybe then you'd still be mine
Oh and only if I had been just a little more kind to you
There'd be no need, for this man to be cryin'

The whole town's laughing at me
Silly fool, how'd you lose such a good friend? Oh

Maybe if I had spent more time with you
Maybe then, maybe then you'd still be mine, maybe I think about it
And only if I had been just a little more kind to you
There'd be no need, for this man to be cryin'

The whole town's laughing at me
Silly fool, how'd you lose such a good friend?
The whole town's laughing at me
Silly fool, how'd you lose such a good friend?
The whole town's laughing at me
Silly fool, how'd you lose such a good friend?
