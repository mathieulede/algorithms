I can't waste my time
Trying every line
All the tricks I used before
One, too many times

And I won't buy you things
Or give you diamond rings
I won't call you day and night
Living to just get close to you 'cause

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

I guess in my heart
On a picture card
Pretty roses just won't do
That just ain't my style

I won't run to you
Like a silly fool
All I have to do is wait
You'll be there in my easy chair, 'cause

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

I'll betcha your love I'll getcha
I'll getcha your love I'll betcha

Nobody else could love me
I'll bet you're thinkin' of me
So why don't cha
Don't put your money on it

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
All I have to do is wait
You'll be there in my easy chair, yeah

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

You better watch out, I'll get you

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine

Gonna be like heaven on earth
So fine, fine, fine, fine
Before you know what hit you
You're gonna be mine
