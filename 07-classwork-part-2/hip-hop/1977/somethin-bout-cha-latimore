SOMETHIN' 'BOUT 'CHA
Latimore
Baby, there ain't no other place
In the world that I'd rather be
And I'm going to stay right here
Till you tell me that you're tired of me
Baby, I feel so good
I feel so good every time I get close to you
Words can't express the feelings
That I have in my heart for you
There's somethin' about cha, ooo baby
There's somethin' about cha
'I don't know what it is
There's somethin' about cha, oooo baby
There's somethin' about cha
If there's anything you ever need or want
Just tell me about it
Lord knows, I don't want to see you without it
I'm gonna try to give you everything you want
When you want it, how you want it
Every time you think you want it

(repeat chorus)
Baby come on and lay your
Fine self down here by my side
I want to make sweet love to you
Baby, till you say you're satisfied
And just as long as I know I got you
I don't need nobody else
If the Lord made anything better than you
He must have kept it to himself
(repeat chorus
