Georgia, oh Georgia
No, no, no, no, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind

I said a Georgia, heh, maybe it's because
I'm from Augusta, Georgia
A song, a song of you
Comes so sweet and clear
Like the moonlight through the pines
Oh now

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you, yeah

Georgia, yea, Georgia
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia on my mind, sing the song

Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes will smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you, oh, oh

Georgia, Georgia
Ahh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no peace I find
Just an old sweet song keeps
Georgia, my hometown, on my mind
Oh Georgia
