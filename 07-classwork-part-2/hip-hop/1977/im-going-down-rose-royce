Time on my hands since you've been away boy
I ain't got no plans
No, no, no, no
And the sound of the rain, against my windowpain
Is slowly, slowly driving me insane

Boy, I'm going down
I'm going down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's turning upside down

Sleep don't come easy
Boy, please believe me
Since you've been gone, everything's going wrong
Why'd you have to say goodbye?
Look what you've done to me
I can't stop these tears from falling from my eyes

Oh Baby
I'm going down
I'm going down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole world's upside down

You ain't around. Going down
Ooh, Baby. I'm in love
Going down. Oh, Oh, Oh

I-I- I'm going down
I'm going down
'Cause you ain't around, baby
My whole worlds upside down

Going down, going down
Oh, babe
Don't want believe
If i can't give my love to you
Im so blue
Going down
Going down
You ain't around
Baby, baby
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
What did I do wrong?
Please forgive me, baby, and come on home
Going down
Going down
Going down
