[Refrain]
I don't love you anymore
It's just that simple
No, no, no, not like before
Such a shame, dirty shame

[Verse 1]
We can't work it out
No, not this time
We can't be together
We can only be friends

You gotta respect each other
You gotta reply to your lover
It could never be
It could never be like it was before
You don't know what I'm talkin' about

[Refrain]
I don't love you anymore
It's just that simple
No, no, no, not like before
Such a shame, dirty shame

[Verse 2]
I'll take care of my responsibilities
I'll send you your money
Every month, you can depend on that
You better believe that you can

But we can't live together
This way we'll be much better

Cause you say you never know
You say you never know
Where I'm comin' from
You see I just got to tell ya

[Refrain]
I don't love you anymore
It's just that simple
No, no, no, not like before

I just got to tell ya
I don't love you anymore
No, no, no, not like before
I don't love you anymore
No, no, no, not like before

[Bridge]
Said I try, and I try, and I try
Said I try

I tried being your man
Tried doing everything that I can
But we can't make it
But we can't make it
We just can't make it
We just can't make it

Maybe someday
When we get our heads together
Well, we can try baby, try baby

[Refrain]
I don't love you anymore
No, no, no, not like before
I don't love you anymore
No, no, no, not like before

I don't love you anymore
No, no, no, not like before
I don't love you anymore
