Gloria
My Gloria
Things ain't been the same
Since you went away

Gloria
My Gloria
I don't want to see
Another day

It seems like
Only yesterday
I beheld your sweet face
And In my lonely room
My memories of your embrace

Gloria
My Gloria
Things ain't been the same
Since you went away

Gloria
My Gloria
I don't want to see
Another day

Isn't it funny
How time can change
All the things you want to believe
But time won't change
The way I feel
Cause in my mind
Its you and me
You and me

Gloria
My Gloria
Things ain't been the same
Since you went away
(I just can't go on)

Gloria
My Gloria
I don't want to see
Another day

(So lonely girl)

Isn't it funny
How time can change
All the things you want to believe
But time won't change
The way I feel
Cause in my mind
Its still you and me
You and me

Gloria
My Gloria
Things ain't been the same
Since you went away

Gloria
My Gloria
I don't want to see
Another day

I don't want to see another day
Without your love
I don't want to see another day
It's a real sad thing
But I don't want to see another day
Without your love
I don't want to see another day
Its gonna hurt me
But I don't want to see another day
