Me get high off the sunshine
Me gettin' high off the sunshine

Every day's the same, me groovin'
Every day's the same, me groovin'
Got no time, keep movin'
Got no time, keep me movin'

Me get high off the sunshine
Me gettin' high off the sunshine

L.A. is my home town
It's a funky town
L.A. is my home town
It's a funky town

Get on down, get on down, get on down
Get on down, get on down, get on down
In my funky town, in my funky town

Me get high off the sunshine
Me gettin' high off the sunshine
Me get high off the sunshine
Me gettin' high off the sunshine

L.A. is my home town
It's a funky town
L.A. is my home town
It's a funky town

Get on down, get on down, get on down
Get on down, get on down, get on down
In my funky town, in my funky town

Get on down, get on down, get on down
Get on down, get on down, get on down
In my funky town, in my funky town

Get on down, get on down, get on down
Get on down, get on down, get on down
