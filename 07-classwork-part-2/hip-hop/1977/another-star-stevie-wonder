[Intro]
La-lala-la-la, la-lala-la
La-lala-la-la, la-lala-la
La-lala-la-la, la-lala-la
La-lala-la-la, la-lala-la

[Verse 1]
For you, there might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you, it's all I see
For you, there might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody

[Hook]
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one, who would break my heart in two

[Verse 2]
For you, love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray
For you, love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday

[Hook]
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one, who would break my heart in two

[Verse 1]
For you, there might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you, it's all I see
For you, there might be another song
But in my heart your melody will stay with me
