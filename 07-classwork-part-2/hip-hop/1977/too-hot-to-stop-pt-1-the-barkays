Yeah, hey, hey, oh yeah
I'd been having
My eyes on you for awhile
Girl, it's something about your act
And I sure do like your style
Maybe it's the way
That you carry yourself
Maybe it's the way
That you ride around
You move with the feeling
And you sure know how
Girl, I'm out to get your love
And I'm too hot to stop now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't mind if I'm considered uncool
'Cause I believe to each his own
I don't play that rule
When you find the special one
That really drives you wild
You owe it to yourself to try
'Cause soon they might be gone
Getting next to you is what I want to do
Girl, I wanna get it somehow
'Cause I'm too hot to stop now
Yeah, hey, hey, yeah
Getting next to you is what I want to do
Getting next to you is what I want to do
Getting next to you is what I want to do
Getting next to you is what I want to do
Yeah, hey, hey, yeah
