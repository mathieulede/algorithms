[Intro]
Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo ooh [x2]

[Verse]
If you look into your heart
With a positive mind
Take some inventory
Of your woman and your glory
Leave the bad things behind
Ooh, everybody's got a story (history)
About love and the good things
But all the spices of your life
You gotta pay the price
If you know what i mean
I'm telling everybody i know
How a girl becomes some pride
When i finally found there was nothing left
I do believe i found myself
When i found there was nothing left
I wanna give it to you baby
If you look into your heart
With a positive mind
Take some inventory
Of your woman and your glory
Leave the bad things behind
I know a man my man he really loves me
We don't have that everyday no no no no
I know my man really needs me
Whatever he wanna do, i wanna do it with you
Baby hey yeah, yeah yeah
Doo doo doo doo
Oh yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Whatever he wanna do, i wanna do it with you
Baby i'm loving you more
And more and more
And giving you all and all
I said mercy baby
I'm loving you more and more and more
I'm giving you all and all
Say mercy baby
I'm loving you more
Mercy baby, mercy baby
Mercy baby
