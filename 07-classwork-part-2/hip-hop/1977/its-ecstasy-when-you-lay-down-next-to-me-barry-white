When we met, it wasn't quite clear to me
What you had in store was there for only me
Silly, you know you took me by surprise
Then I turned and looked, I saw that message in your eye

There you were, I fell on the floor
The way you move, girl, only made me want you more
I did not know you had me hypnotized
There's a movement of your body dancin' in my eyes

I know I had to hold you and make you mine
Don't want to control you just to have a good time
In ecstasy when you're layin' down next to me
Oh, no, no, ecstasy, yeah, when you're layin' down next to me

I find it hard for me to concentrate
If I don't make my move, girl, it might be too late
I've got to make sure you don't get away
After all you done, girl, to make me wanna stay

All my life I've been searchin' for a star
Now my search is over and here we are
Livin' in ecstasy, yeah, when you lay down next to me, yeah
Here in ecstasy, when you're layin' down next to me

I wanna hold you and make you mine
Don't want to control you just to have a good time
Livin' in ecstasy, well, when you're layin' down next to me
Ooh! ooh! wee, ecstasy, when you're layin' here with me, uh-huh

In this ecstasy when you are here with me, yeah
Oh, it's ecstasy, Lord knows when you're next to me, yeah
