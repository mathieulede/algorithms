I've been in love through thick and thin
I've always been your friend
I was ridin' high, so high

But I clouded my mind with my emotion
I went and gave you my deep ocean
How could you question what I'd be
When the only question is

Why, oh why, oh, why can't I make love to you
After all that we've been through
I cry my tears just like a clown
When the circus comes to town

With a smile, with a smile
Forget about all my fears
A smile will hide the tracks of these tears
Runnin' on down my face, well, well
Just another day, yeah

You've never been in love before
No one could love you more
More than I, oh I

You're livin' in your world of fantasies
Just like a movie queen
I guess, I'll stay and see the end
Imagine I was here for a while, a while

While I'm leaving it all up to you
Do what you got to do, hey girl
It's such a shame it isn't real
The feelings that I feel inside, inside

Forget about all the years
A smile will hide the tracks of these tears
Runnin' on down my face, well, well
Just another day
Just another day

I said, what I'm tryin' to say
Said, what I'm tryin' to say
I need, baby, just another day
Just another little bit
Just another, another little day, baby
