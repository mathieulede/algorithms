Verbal intro

You can call Mrs. Johnson to
Keep the kids for a day or two
Take the early flight to Florida
Just the way you used to do

Have room service bring you breakfast
Make love all through the day
If you're not back in love by Monday
Then you go your separate way

If you're not back in love by Monday
You can't say you didn't try
But before you bury your love
Just make sure you let it die

Sleep a few more nights together
Say the things that you used to say
And if you're not back in love by Monday
You just go your separate way

You can find that little cafe
With the funny sounding name
Get the corner by the window
Tell him you love him once again

If the disco dj's still there
Go on, dance til the break of day
If you're not back in love by Monday
Then you go your separate way

If you're not back in love by Monday
You can't say you didn't try
But before you bury your love
Just make sure you let it die

Oh, oh, go on
Sleep a few more nights together
Say the things that you used to say
If you're not back in love by Monday
Then you go your separate way

Then you go your separate way
