HELLO
This is J
L.J. baby
No wait a minute please, don't hang up on me
You see I know you been going through some changes
But i've been going through some changes myself
Walking the floors can't sleep
Slamming doors darling to me it's just a drag
But it's all because
I Can't Get Over You
I tired and I tired
Oh I just can't get you off my mind
This feeling I have for you
Is strong indeed with a flame I can't put out
I tired to do without you and fine someone new, someone new
You found yourself a new love
And it's driving me sane
Oh
I Can't Get Over You
Oh baby
I tired and tired, oh..... I just can't get you off of my mind
Your love, your love, your love means more to me then life itself
And without you I can't go on

Theres nothing, nothing I can do
To pick up the pieces no matter how hard
It seems that you were made for me baby
And no matter how I try
I can't, I can't, I can't
I Can't Get Over You
Over you, Over you
Ohhhhhhhhh....I Can't Get Over You
And tho I tried my best your love, your love
Won't give, won't give my mind any rest
Hey lady and I never thought
I never thought, wooooooo
That love could be, could be so dog gone hard
That's the reason why I call ya
My tears keep falling like rain from a weeping willow
And all night long I been wetting my pillow
Oh baby
And I can't shake your love baby
My friends keep telling me to find someone new
Woooooo...They don't know how much I really love
I can't stand to live without you baby
Oh yeah, my, my, my......fade out
