Here we are in a room full of strangers
I'm standing in the dark
Where your eyes couldn't see me

Well, I have to follow you
Though you did not want me to
But that won't stop my lovin' you
I just can't stay away

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight to the heart songs

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town

Now in my place
There are so many others
Standin' in the line
How long will they stand between us?

Well, I have to follow you
Though you didn't want me to
But I just can't stop lovin' you babe
Say, can't stay away

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight to the heart songs

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway

Well, I have to follow you
Though you didn't want me to
But I just can't stop lovin' you babe
Say I can't stay away

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight to the heart songs

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town

Blaming it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them love songs
Singin' them straight to the heart songs

Blamin' it all on the nights on Broadway
Singin' them sweet sounds
To that crazy, crazy town
