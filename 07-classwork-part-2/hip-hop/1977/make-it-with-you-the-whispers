Hey, have you ever tried
Really reaching out for the other side
I may be climbing on rainbows, but baby, here goes
(Here we, here we go)

Dreams are for those who sleep, life is for us to keep
And if you're wond'ring what this song is leading to

I want to make it with you
(I really think that we can make it, girl)
I said I want to make it with you you, baby
I want to make it, I got to make it
Hey, I want to make it with you, baby
Because we belong together (yes we do, I know we can)
Oh, we can make it, girl

No, you don't know me well
Every little thing, only time will tell
If you believe the things that I do then we'll see it through

Life can be short or long, love can be right or wrong
If I choose the one I'd like to see me through

I want to make it with you
(I really think that we can make it, girl)
Said I want to make it with you, baby
I want to make it with you, baby
I want to make it with you, girl
I want to make it, wanna make it with you, baby
Said we belong together (Yes, we do)
We are going to be so happy, baby (I know we can)
I know we can, I know we can

Dreams they're for those who sleep, life is for us to keep
If you believe the things that I do
We're gonna see it through

Life can be short or long, love can be right or wrong
If I chose the one I'd like to see me through
I want to make it with you

(I really think that we can make it, girl)
I really want to make it with you, girl
(I really think that we can make it)
(I really think that we can make it, girl)
Oh, can I have your love
(I really think that we can make it)
I said I need, I need your love

I'm gonna lock you into my love
Hey, I'm gonna lock you into my love
Because we belong together (we do, yes we do)

(Dreams....)
(Life....)
(We belong together, we do, yes we do)
(I know we can make it, yes we can, wanna be a man)

(Repeat)
