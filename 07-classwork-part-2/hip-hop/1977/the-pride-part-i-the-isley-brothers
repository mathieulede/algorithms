Give me the price to pay
To stay in this game you play
Although your game is strong
Move on, the heat is on
Ha-ha the heat is on, yeah the heat is on
Hey you better keep movin' on, hey-hey the heat is on

Undercover you hide away
Layin' back to make your play
The bigger the thrill, the better the song
Move on the heat is on, Ah the heat is on
Hey you better keep movin' on, the heat is on
Can you feel it-yeah, yeah

The charge of love is on the way
Make it easy, make me stay
In case you can't hang on
Move on, the heat is on
Well the heat is on, I can feel the heat is on
That's why I keep movin' on, I know the heat is on

Lightnin' strikesâ€”thunder breaks
And in a flash, you're on your way
And if you're tryin' to lead me on
Move on the heat is on...the heat is on
Hey the heat is on, you better keep movin' on
Said the heat is on

I can feel that the heat, the heat is on
I'm movin', y'all see me movin' on

Yeah! I can feel that the heat is on
Everybody feel it...
