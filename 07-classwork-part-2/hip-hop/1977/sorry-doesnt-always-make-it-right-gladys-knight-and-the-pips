No one ever loved you more
And you're all I'm living for
Now it's time for you to leave
It's so hard to believe
You're not in love with me

Baby there's no easy way to hear the words
I'm sorry I don't love you, ooh
You tried to leave me once before
But felt so bad you let me love you more

And baby there's no gentle way
No tender sentimental way to leave me, ooh
You offered me your sympathy
But I'm as lonely as can be
Sorry doesn't always make it right

No one ever loved you so
You were trying to go
I guess I didn't know

Baby there's no easy way to hear the words
I'm sorry I don't love you, hey
You hurt me then apologized
I better go before I lose my pride

Baby there's no gentle way
No tender sentimental way to leave me, hey
Oh, I wish that I could make you care
But all in love just isn't fair
But sorry doesn't always make it right

No one ever loved you more
And you're all I'm living for
Now it's time for you leave
Ooh, it's so hard to believe
You're not in love with me

Ooh, no one, no one ever loved you more
And you're all I'm living for
Now it's time for you leave
It's so hard to believe
You're not in love with me, yeah
