[Chorus]
She's a brick house
She's mighty mighty, just letting it all hang out
She's a brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

She's a brick house
She's the one, the only one
Who's built like an amazon
We're together everybody knows
And this is how the story goes

[Verse 1]
She knows she got everything
That a woman needs to get a man
How can she lose with what she use
36-24-36, what a winning hand

[Chorus]
She's a brick house
She's mighty mighty, just letting it all hang out
She's a brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

She's a brick house
She's the one, the only one
Who's built like an amazon
We're together everybody knows
And this is how the story goes

[Verse 2]
The clothes she wears, the sexy ways
Make an old man wish for younger days
She knows she's built and knows how to please
Sure enough to knock a strong man to his knees

[Chorus]
She's a brick house
She's mighty mighty, just letting it all hang out
She's a brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

She's a brick house
She's the one, the only one
Who's built like an amazon
We're together everybody knows
And this is how the story goes

[Interlude]
Shake it down, shake it down now

[Chorus]
She's a brick house
She's mighty mighty, just letting it all hang out
She's a brick house
The lady's stacked and that's a fact
Ain't holding nothing back

She's a brick house
She's the one, the only one
Who's built like an amazon
We're together everybody knows
And this is how the story goes
