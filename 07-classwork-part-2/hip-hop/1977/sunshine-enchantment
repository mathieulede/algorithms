Hello, sunshine
It's mighty good to see
You're doing really fine
And although it's been
A long, long time
I still find that you're heavy on my mind

And, oh, I see
You're still looking good, baby
Just like I knew you would
But there's only thing wrong
I don't see you, baby
Not like before

(Sunshine has faded away)
My sunshine has faded away
(My skies are cloudy and gray)
And my skies are cloudy and gray, baby

(And I can't stop these tears)
I can't stop these tears from falling
From my eyes, yeah, yeah
(From my eyes) from my eyes

Yeah, yeah....
I'm missing you

Ooh, hoo
Hello, love child
I see you still got your pretty smile
Tell me, is it true what they say, baby?
That you're married
And have a baby on the way

And, oh, here I stand
Just a half of a man
Just holding on the best I can
I know this might be
The wrong thing to say
But without your love
I can't face another day

(Sunshine has faded away)
My sunshine has faded away, baby
(My skies are cloudy and gray)
The skies are cloudy and gray, baby

(And I can't stop these tears)
I can't stop these tears from falling)
(From my eyes) from my eyes, yeah, yeah
(From my eyes) from my eyes

Yeah, yeah.....
I'm missing you, baby

(Sunshine has faded away)
Baby
(My skies are cloudy and gray)
And the skies are cloudy and gray, baby

(And I can't stop these tears)
I can't stop these tears from falling
(From my eyes) from my eyes
Yeah, yeah, from my eyes
(Been so long since you without me)
But I still miss you more
And more each and every day

Sunshine has faded away
(Oh, baby, I just can't stand another day)
My skies are cloudy and gray
(Since you went away)
