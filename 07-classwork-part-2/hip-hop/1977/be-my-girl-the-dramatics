Baby you know sometimes you make me want to scream
Woo,uhhhhhhhh
Suga, suga, suga, yeah, yeah
All was not lost today, your brown eyes converted me
And let me know that your the right girl for me
You don't need to, you don't, need too
Of the same love I offer you
It would be ashame to let someone else take my place
Now, you got me dreaming
I can tell without you being there
So stop this mistreating me
I wanna stay with you, I wanna lay with you
I wanna, be your man, be my girl
Be my girl
Be my girl, (repeat 5 times)
I need you in a despreate way
All the girls I've met where so full of play
It's not even a bother if I forgot their names.....
Oh yeah

In the minute I first saw you
And every, every, every, every, teenage fanasy came true
But you look the other way
And my walking for the day, broke my sprit,broke my sprit
Now
You got me dreaming, got me dreaming
And I can tell without you being there
So stop this mistreating me....Oh
I wanna stay with you, I wanna lay with you
I wanna be your man
Be my girl, my girl, be my girl
Baby
Be my girl
Want ya be my girl, hey hey
I want you to be my girl
My girl
Want ya be my girl
I want you to be my girl
Want ya please
