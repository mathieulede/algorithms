Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without your love, oh baby

Don't leave me this way
'Cos I can't exist and I will surely miss
Your tender kiss, don't leave me this way

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul

Now can't you see it's burning out of control?
So come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cos only your good loving can set me free
(Set me free,baby set me free)

Don't, don't you leave me this way, no
Don't you understand, I'm at your command?
Oh baby, please, please don't leave me this way, no, baby

Don't, don't you leave me this way
'Cos I can't survive, I sure can't stay alive
Without your love, baby
Don't leave, never leave me baby

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control?

So come on, satisfy the need in me
'Cos only your good loving is gonna set me free
Set me free, set me free
I need your loving, baby, I needed, I need, I need your love
Right now, right now, right now, right now baby
(Please, please, please don't go)
Yeah, baby
Don't you leave me darling
(Please, please, please don't go)
Your love is so [?] for me, Oh baby
(Please, please, please don't go)
Don't you leave me baby, no
(Please, please, please don't go)
(Please, please, please don't go)
I feel like, I feel like, I feel like, I feel like I'm little bit to good to you baby
(Please, please, please don't go)
