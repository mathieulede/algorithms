I use to sing to an empty room. I was so lonley and so out of toon. Then you came around and made my life a happy song. It's a joy to have your love. Such a joy to feel your love. Never set me free, cause darline i can't be without you without you baby. I use to go to a show all alone. I'd sit through it twice I just couldn't go home. Then you came alone and gave my life a happy song. It's a joy to have your love, such a joy to feel your love. Never set me free, cause darline I can't be without you, without you baby. Have you baby, have you baby. ohh. I feel so good havin you around. It's a joy to have you, It's a joy to see you, It's a joy to feel you, such a joy to have your love. it's a joy to have, such a joy to feel. Never set me free cause baby I don't wanna be can't be without you
