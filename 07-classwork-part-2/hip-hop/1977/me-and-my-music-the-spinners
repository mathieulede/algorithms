I'm the kind of guy who don't mind
Sharing anything I've got
All my friends call me easy
'Cause I can take a awful lot

But when it comes down to my music
Baby, that's where I draw the line
And if you try to separate us
Then you ain't no friend of mine

I'm talking 'bout, talking 'bout music, yes, I am
That's all I'm living for
Just me and my music, yes, it is
That's all I'm living for

Ain't nothing ever made me feel better
Than music
Ain't nothing ever made me feel better
Than music

Come on, right near

You can borrow all my money
Pay me back when you can
Or you can take out my favorite lady
'Cause I know she'll be back again

But when it comes down to my music, yeah
That's where I draw the line
And if you try to separate us
Then you ain't no friend of mine

I'm talking 'bout, talking 'bout music, yes, I am
That's all I'm living for
Oh, it's me and my music, yes it is
That's all I'm living for

Let me tell you people
Ain't nothing ever made me feel better
Than music
Ain't nothing ever made me feel better
Than music

Music, music, that's all I'm living for
Music, music, that's all I'm living for

'Cause when I was just a little boy
Way back in Ohio, in Cincinnati
Known as the east side of town

I remember that till now
We had a singing family, oh Lord
Music and me
Music and me

We used to have a bad time
And love was in a mirror of life
A any morning Mark and me
Never happy with me

Campus going when the times were hard
And now I'm singing praises to the Lord
You say music is peace, yes, it is
A different calm and a harmony

Just me and my music
Just me and my music
That's all I'm living for
When I'm feeling down

A pretty song can turn me around
Starting with the moves and uh
Oh was loving and my lover

Oh it's me and my music
Oh it's me and my music
Oh me and me my music, yes it is
It's me and my music

As we're going out
