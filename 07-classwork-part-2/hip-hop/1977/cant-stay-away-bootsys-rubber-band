I just can’t stay
I, I can’t stay
Oh, I can’t stay
Hey!

Oh I can’t stay away from you too long
I hum your face just like a new song
Your smile is like a punch line
The part you sing all the time
Oh I can’t stay away from you too long

You know your name should be Melody baby
‘Cause your personality is, uh, so melodic
I been dreamin’ to the tune of you
Since first we met
You turned me on in a day

Ever since I kissed you
I could never stand to miss you
So I’m singing ‘bout your kisses
Every moment of the day

Oh I can’t stay away from you too long
Your melody, I taste them when you’re gone
Your smile is like a punch line
The part you sing all the time
Oh I can’t stay away from you too long

You’re number one with a bullet
On my chart
You’re a total smash baby
Pop, you’re R&B, you’re MOR
You’re easy listening
You turned me on in a day baba

Ever since I kissed you
I could never stand to miss you
So I’m singing ‘bout your kisses
Every moment of the day

You’re so psychedelic baby
You’re also pretty music to my ears
By the way
What key are you in baby?
La di da, la di da, la di di da da baba
Well

I can’t stay away
I can’t stay away
I can’t stay away
I can’t stay away
I just can’t stay away
I can’t stay away
I just can’t stay away
(repeat over and over…)
