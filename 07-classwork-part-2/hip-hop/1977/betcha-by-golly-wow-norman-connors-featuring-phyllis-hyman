BETCHA BY GOLLY WOW

There's a spark of magic in your eyes
Candyland appears each time you smile
Never thought that fairytales came true
But they come true, when I'm near you
You're a genie in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise

And, Betcha by golly Wow!
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
Forever will my love for you keep growing strong, oh keep growing strong

If I could I'd catch a falling star to shine on you so I'd know where you are
All the rainbows in your favorite shade to show I love you thinking of you
Write your name across the sky
Anything you have to try

Betcha by golly Wow!
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong, oh keep growing strong

OOOOOh Write your name across the sky
Anything you have to try
Cause Betcha by golly Wow!
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong, oh keep growing strong

Keep growing strong (moving on and growing (ad lib to end)
