How can I tell my mom and dad
That I've been bad
How can I tell my mom and dad
That I've been bad

(Verse 1)
Will they understand
How much I love that man
And oh, will they ever know
How much he's hurt me so
I know I was a fool
To be loved by you
But I've got to find a way
But what can I say

(Somebody please) How can I tell my mom and dad
(Help me explain, help me explain) That I've been bad
(This misery) How can I tell my mom and dad
(Oh, please) That I've been bad

(Verse 2)
He told me that he loved me
And that our love was true
Oh, but when we made me mother-to-be
He disappeared on me
Now I'm so ashamed
'Cause you quit the game
And left me here to be
In all this misery

(Somebody please) How can I tell my mom and dad
(Help me explain, help me explain) That I've been bad
(This misery) How can I tell my mom and dad
(Oh, please) That I've been bad

(Verse 3)
Should I go up to mama
And say, "Guess what I've done" {No-no}
Or disappear in the night
And let them notice I'm gone {No-no}
Or should I go out and do
Somethin' I wouldn't want to {No-no}
Or stand up like a big girl
And I'll tell 'em about me and you

(Somebody please) How can I tell my mom and dad
(Help me explain, help me explain) That I've been bad
(This misery) How can I tell my mom and dad
(Oh, please) That I've been bad (Whoa...)

(Verse 4)
Should I go up to mama
And say, "Guess what I've done" {No-no}
Or disappear in the night
And let them notice I'm gone {No-no}
Or should I go out and do
Somethin' I wouldn't want to {No-no}
Or stand up like a big girl
And I'll shout about me and you

(Somebody please) How can I tell my mom and dad
(Help me explain, help me explain) That I've been bad
(This misery) How can I tell my mom and dad
(Oh, please) That I've been bad

(Daddy will be so terrified) How can I tell my mom and dad
(Yes, he will) That I've been bad
(Mom's so upset that she'll wanna die) How can I tell my mom and dad
(Help me) That I've been bad

(How can I tell them I'm a mother-to-be)
How-how-how-how I've been bad
(Help me explain to them he does love me)
How-how-how-how I've been bad
