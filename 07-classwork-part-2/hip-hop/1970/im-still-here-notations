I'm still here
After telling you, so long
I'm still here baby
After saying that, I'd be gone
And now maybe, I was just
Talking out of my head
But baby, if I wasn't
Can I take back what I said
Cause when I (need someone to hold)
Hey baby
You're right here to hold me
When I (need someone to kiss)
Ooh wee girl
You're right here to kiss me
When I (want some understanding)
Oh yeah
Your love don't resist me
For you're here
And I'm so glad that I'm still here (still here Ooooo)
After making you so blue
I'm still here (Still here)
After saying that we are through
And now maybe I was just
Talking out of my head
But baby, if I wasn't
Can I take back what I said
Cause when I (need someone to hold)
Hey baby
You're right here to hold me
When I (need someone to kiss)
Ooh wee girl
You're right here to kiss me
When I (want some understanding)
Oh yeah
You're love don't resist me
For you're here
And I'm so glad that
I'm still here (Still here Oooooo)
Now I'm still here (Still here) Mmmmm
After making you so blue
I'm still here (Still here) baby (Ooooo)
After searching for somebody new
And now maybe I was just
Talking out of my head
But baby, if I wasn't
Can I take back what I said
Cause when I (need someone to hold)
Hey baby
You're right here to hold me
When I (need someone to kiss)
Ooh wee girl
You're right here to kiss me
When I (want some understanding)
Oh yeah
Your love don't resist me
For you're here (Still here)
Oooo weee
