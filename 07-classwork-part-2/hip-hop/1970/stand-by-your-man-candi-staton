Sometimes it's hard to be a woman
Giving all your love to just one man
Oh, yeah, you'll have bad times
He'll have good times
Doing things that
You don't understand

But if you love him
You'll forgive him
Oh, oh, oh, even though
He's hard to understand

Mmm hmm, if you love him
Be proud of him
'Cause after all
He's just a man

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
He's giving you
All the love you can

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And something, something warm to come to
When the nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man and show
Show the world you love him
He's giving you
All the love you can, yeah
