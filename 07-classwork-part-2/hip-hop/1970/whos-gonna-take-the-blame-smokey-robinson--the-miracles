We were just kids
Playin' in the rain
When you threw a stone
And you broke a window pane

You were so afraid
For what you done
That I held your hand, little one
And I wouldn't let you run

Then you turned to me with a look of shame
On your face
And your eyes asked a question
Ever so tenderly

Ohh, who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew
How it always be...
Put the blame...
Put it on me

Ewwww
At the age of twelve
You were a fine young thing
But I felt much older
'Cause I had to shoulder
The trouble you'd bring

Like the time you pushed Sonny
And she cried on me
With those same big eyes
You turned and you looked at me, ohhh
Who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Right then, I knew
How it always be...
Put the blame...
Put it on me

Put it on me...
Put it on me...

Now you're all grown up
And you're running wild
And they're surprised
'Cause all along you seemed
Like such a sweet child

And there's nothing but bad news
For? I need
How you've become
A woman of the street

They give a million and one reasons why
But when I analyze it
I know where the real fault lies

Ohhh
Who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
No doubt about it...
Ewww
This time rightfully
Put the blame...
Put it on me

Who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Ewww
Put the blame...
Put it on me

Who will take the blame?
Who's gonna bear the shame?
Put the blame...
Put it on me
