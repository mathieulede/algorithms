Stay away from me
I love you too much
Stay away from me
I love you too much
You seem to get in my bones
Until I can't control myself
I find that all my
Systems are gone
When you do it to me
I'd leave if I could
But you're loving too good
So stay away from me
I love you too much
Stay away from me
I love you too much
What's the use in crying
Whatever you sell
You know, I'm buying
You're sure keeping
A thing on me
That makes me
Love you so tenderly
Such a heavy blow
Until I can't get up and go
So stay away from me
I love you too much
Stay away from me
I love you too much
Stay away
