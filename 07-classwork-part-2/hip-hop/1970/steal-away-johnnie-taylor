Don`t you wanna steal it (steal it)
I wanna steal it (steal it)
Let me see you steal it (steal it)

I`ve got to see you somehow
Not tomorrow, right now
I know it`s late, I can`t wait
Come on, steal away
Won`t you let me steal it

Don`t wanna start thinking
I might change my mind
Everybody`s sleeping
Let`s not waste any time
I know it`s late, I can`t wait
Girl, you got to wanna steal it

I know it`s wrong
Meeting you this way
There`s no other way
That I can be with you

If only your folks
Would approve
Things like this, you and I
Wouldn`t have to do, no, no

Steal it, lord, have mercy
I got to steal it
Soembody out there
They wanna steal it
They wanna steal it

I know it`s late, I can`t wait
Won`t you help me steal it

I know it`s wrong
Meeting you this way
There`s no other way
That I can be with you

If only, if only, if only
Your folks would approve
Things like this, we
Wouldn`t have to do, no

I won`t tell
I won`t tell nobody else
I`m gonna keep it to myself

I know it`s late
Don`t you hesitate
Come on and steal away
Let me steal your love

??? trying to criticize me
But you would be doing
The same thing that I`m doing

Everybody wanna steal away
Lord, please don`t criticize me
I`m trying to steal a little love
Don`t you want to steal away

Don`t you want to steal away
Don`t you want to steal away
