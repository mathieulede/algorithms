As I stand here these evening
Looking out over the metropolis of Los Angeles, California
I can't help but think about the young lady that I met here
So I wrote a song tonight and I call it my California girl

California girl, you're living in a different world
Let the sun shine in, right here where my love begins
No, I won't ever hurt you, no, I won't make you cry, no
California girl, I'm gonna love, love you till the day I die, yeah
Everybody help me sing this song one more time, yeah

California girl, you're living by the sand and sea
And it means every little thing now, now that you belong to me
Oh, I'm gonna make you happy, oh, I'm gonna see you smile, yeah
My California, California, California
I'm gonna love you baby, till the day I die, yeah

California girl, oh, you live in a different world, yes you are
And it means every little thing darling, now that you are my girl, yeah
No, I won't never hurt you, baby, I won't see you cry, no
My California, California, California
I'm gonna love you baby, till the day I die, yeah

Everybody help me sing these song one more time
California girl, California girl
Oh, I'm gonna love you baby, yes I am
Till the day, the day, the day, the day I die, yeah

You see I'm not ashamed tonight
To say these words to the young lady
That I met at the metropolis of Los Angeles, California, huh
And as I look out over the sky tonight
Through the fog and through the smog
I can't help but think about that young girl, oh, oh, oh baby
Everybody, help me, help me sing one more time, yeah
