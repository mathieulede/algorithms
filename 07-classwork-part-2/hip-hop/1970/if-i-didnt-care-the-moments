If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go round and round
While my heart stands still&63

If I didn't care would it still be the same?
Would my ev'ry prayer begin and end with just, just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?
