We've been together for so long
Listen baby, I'm gonna love you right or wrong, hey
Don't fence me out 'cause I love you so
And I never want, want to let you go

But you keep trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me, trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
You keep trying, trying, trying, trying, trying, trying, oh yeah

Our love was done before it starts
Listen baby, you think that you are having fun, hey
Somehow I know, when you hurt me so
Sooner or later going to let me go

And you keep trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me, trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me
You keep trying, trying, trying, trying, trying, trying, oh yeah

Somehow I know, when you hurt me so
Sooner or later going to let me go

And you keep trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me, trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me, trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me, trying to make a fool of me
Trying to make a fool of me, trying to make a fool of me
