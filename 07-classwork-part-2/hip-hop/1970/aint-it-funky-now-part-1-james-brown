Girl, let me tell you what you got to do
Keepin' me so mellow, so nobody can get through
When he had to do your lovin', smilin' keeps us cheek
Walk away and twist your hip, make sure you keep him weak
Don't let nobody take care o' your business better than you do
Do what he wants, give what he wants, expect 'em come to you
And than you can hold your men, you can hold your men, you can hold your men
You can hold... hey!

You know what we got to tell 'em to take a plea until balls
Use your thing so carefully and don't be a total loss
Sister, when you loved your man, be careful, I ain't tellin' that
