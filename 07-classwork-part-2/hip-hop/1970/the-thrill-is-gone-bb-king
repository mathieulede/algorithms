[Verse 1]
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away
You know you done me wrong baby
And you'll be sorry someday

[Verse 2]
The thrill is gone
It's gone away from me
The thrill is gone, baby
The thrill is gone away from me
Although I'll still live on
But so lonely I'll be

[Verse 3]
The thrill is gone
The thrill is gone away for good
Oh, the thrill is gone, baby
It's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be over it all baby
Just like I know a man should

[Verse 4]
I'm free now baby
I'm free from your spell
Free,  free, free now
Baby I'm free from your spell
And now that it's over
All I can do is wish you well

The thrill is gone
It's gone away for good
The thrill is gone baby
The thrill is gone away for good
You know you done me wrong baby
And you'll be sorry someday
The thrill is gone
Free from your spell baby
Yes I'm free, ooh I'm free, yes I'm free
