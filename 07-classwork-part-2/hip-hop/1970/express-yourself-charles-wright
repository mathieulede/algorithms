Express Yourself!

You don't ever need help from nobody else. All you got to do now:

Express Yourself!

What ever you do, do it good
What ever you do, do it good. All right...

It's not what you look like, when you're doinÂ´ what you're doinÂ´
It's what you're doinÂ´ when you're doinÂ´ what you look like you're doinÂ´!

Express Yourself!
Express Yourself!

They're doinÂ´it on the moon, yeah...
In the jungle too
Everybody on the floor, now
JumpinÂ´ like a kangaroo
So let the horns do the thing they do, yo...

Some people have everything, and other people don't
But everything don't mean a thing if it ainÂ´t the thing you want

Express Yourself!
Express Yourself!

O, do it! O, do it
Do it to it. Go on and do it
Yo, do it. Give
