If I could be you and you could be me for just one hour, oh yeah
And if we could find a way to get inside each other's mind, oh yeah
If you could see you through my eyes instead of your ego, alright
I believe you'd be surprised to see that you'd been blind, oh yeah
Walk a mile in my shoes, walk a mile in my shoes
Before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
Yet we spend the day throwin' stones at one another, oh yeah
'Cause I don't think or wear my hair the same way that you do
Well, I maybe common people but I'm your brother, oh yeah
And when you strike out and try to hurt me, it's hurtin' you
And oh walk a mile in my shoes, walk a mile in my shoes
And before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes, oh yeah
Oh there are people on the reservation and down in the ghettos, oh yeah
And brother, but for the grace of God, it could be you and I, oh yeah
And if I only had the wings of a little angel, oh yeah, don't you know I'd fly
To the top of the mountain and then I would cry
Oh walk a mile in my shoes, oh yeah, walk a mile in my shoes, alright
And before you abuse, criticize and accuse
Walk a mile in my shoes
Oh walk a mile in my shoes, oh yeah, walk a mile in my shoes
