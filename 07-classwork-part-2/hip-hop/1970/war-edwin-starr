[Intro]
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing

[Verse 1]
War is something that I despise
Because it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears in thousands of mothers' eyes
When their sons go out to fight and lose their lives
I said

[Hook]
(War) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it again
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing

[Verse 2]
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker
War is the enemy of all mankind
The thought of war blows my mind
War has caused unrest, within the younger generation
Induction then destruction. Who wants to die?

[Hook]
(War) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it, say it, say it
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing

[Verse 3]
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Its only friend is the undertaker
War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much too short and precious to be fighting wars these days
War can't give life it can only take it away

[Hook]
(War) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Absolutely nothing, say it
(War, what is it good for?) Absolutely nothing

[Verse 4]
Listen to me
(War), It ain't nothing but a heartbreaker
(War), Friend only to the undertaker
Peace, love and understanding
Tell me, is there no place for them today?
They say we must fight to keep our freedom
But Lord knows there's gotta be a better way

[Hook]
(War) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) You tell me, say it, say it, say it, say it
(War) good God y'all
(What is it good for?) Stand up and shout it (Nothing)
