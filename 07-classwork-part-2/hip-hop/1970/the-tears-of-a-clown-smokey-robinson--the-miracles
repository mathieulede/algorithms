[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Now if there's a smile on my face
It's only there trying to fool the public
But when it comes down to fooling you
Now honey that's quite a different subject
But don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Really I'm sad
Oh I'm sadder than sad
You're gone and I'm hurtin' so bad
Like a clown I pretend to be glad

[Pre-Chorus]
Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than

[Chorus]
The tears of a clown, when there's no one around
Oh yeah baby

[Verse 2]
Now if I appear to be carefree
It's only to camouflage my sadness
And honey to shield my pride I try
To cover this hurt with a show of gladness
But don't let my show convince you
That I've been happy since you

Decided to go
Oh I need you so
I'm hurt and I want you to know
But for others I put on a show, ooh yeah

[Hook]
Now there's some sad things known to man
But ain't too much sadder than
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah baby

[Bridge]
Just like Pagliacci did
I try to keep my sadness hid
Smiling in the public eye
But in my lonely room I cry

[Chorus]
The tears of a clown
When there's no one around
Oh yeah baby

[Outro]
Now if there's a smile on my face
Don't let my glad expression
Give you the wrong impression
Don't let this smile I wear
Make you think that I don't care
When really I'm sad, I'm hurting so bad
