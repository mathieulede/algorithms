When you get right down to it
Isn't this moment what
It's all about, girl

And when you get right down to it
Don't you just feel this
Moment's everything

Holding you, touching you
Girl, I need a whole lifetime
To do all the things
That I wanna do for you
With you, to you

When you get right down to it
Doesn't this moment
Wash away the bad times

And when you get right down to it
Doesn't all the hurt
You ever felt disappear

Holding you, touching you
Girl, I know that this magic
Just can't last forever but then

When you get right down to it
Don't you want to live
The moments again and again
And again and again...

Holding you, touching you
Girl, I know that this magic
Just can't last forever but then

When you get right down to it
Don't you want to live
The moments again and again
And again and again...
