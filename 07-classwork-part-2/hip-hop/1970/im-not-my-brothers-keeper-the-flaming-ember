I'm not my brother's keeper, though he be strong or weaker
Before you judge me, why not try to love me?
I'll try to help you when he's wrongin' us
Don't point your finger, sayin' it's all of us

If a man yells "hate," will my voice be heard?
Does he speak for me when he chooses one bad word?
When wrong is done under one person's name
Should all the people have to share the blame?

I'm not my brother's keeper, though he be strong or weaker
Before you judge me, why not try to love me?
If I do wrong, then someone make me pay
But if I'm right, don't try to block my way

Don't judge the story without opening up the book
The good you find inside it many times is overlooked
Being militant don't mean peace ain't in your heart
Though we're most impatient for freedom to start

I'm not my brother's keeper, though he be strong or weaker
Before you judge me, why not try to love me?
Don't cut into me with your knives of doubt
Before you judge me, why not hear me out?

Whoa, brothers!!
(I'm not my brother's keeper) [Repeat: x9]
I'm not my brother's keeper, though he be strong or weaker
Before you judge me, why not try to love me?

I'll try to help you when he's wrongin' us
Don't point your finger, sayin' it's all of us
[Repeat until fade]
