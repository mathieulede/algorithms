My heart was a lonely house
Where strangers wandered in and out
Ooh, until Tuesday

Many loves have come and gone
With days running on and on
Like a marathon until Tuesday

[Chorus]
Everything is Tuesday
Feeling light headed and woozy
Everything's been rosy since
The day sweet Tuesday chose me

I wanna thank her, thank her, thank her
I wanna thank her, thank her, thank her
I wanna thank her for loving me
Sweet Tuesday, darling Tuesday

Too lonely to be free
I walk the streets in search of me
Until Tuesday

Just a shadow on the wall
Shrinking small
But with Tuesday
I stand ten feet tall

[Repeat Chorus]
I wanna thank her, thank her, thank her
I wanna thank this girl of mine
I wanna thank her for loving me
Sweet Tuesday, darling Tuesday

[Repeat Chorus]
I wanna thank her, thank her, thank her
I wanna thank this girl of mine
I wanna thank her for loving me
Sweet Tuesday, darling Tuesday

Everything is Tuesday
Tuesday, Tuesday...
