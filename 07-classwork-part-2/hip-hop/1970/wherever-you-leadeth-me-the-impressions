Wherever you leadeth me
I will follow
Across the water blue
Deep or shallow

If the way, is dark
We'll make it through me and you
It may sound a little strange
But it's my own thing, own thing, own thing

Whatever may be your wants and needs
Just call on me
My everything belongs to you
And you can have it free

Understand I love, you so
And I mean it sincerely
It may sound a little strange
But I love you dearly, dearly, dearly

Understand I love, you so
And I mean it sincerely
It may sound a little strange
But I love you dearly, dearly, dearly

Wherever you leadeth me
I will follow
Across the water blue
Deep or shallow

Even if the way, is dark
We'll make it through me and you
It may sound a little strange
But it's my own thing, own thing, own thing
