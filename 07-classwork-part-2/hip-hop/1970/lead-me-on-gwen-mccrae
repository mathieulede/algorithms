You know how it feels, you understand
What it is to be a stranger in this unfriendly land
Here's my hand, here's my hand
Take it darling and I'll follow you

Let me walk, I want to walk right by your side
Let your love be my only guide
Here's my hand, here's my wand
Why don't you take it darling and just lead me on?

Lead me on, lead me on
I know I'm a stranger and so all alone
Here's my hand, here's my wand
Why don't you take it darling and just lead me on?

And I'll follow you
