I wanna know if it's good to you, baby
When you do what you do to me
I know that it must have been good to you, baby
Cause it sure feels good to me

I don't know what you been doin'
But it's got my whole world groovin'
Since we met everything keeps movin'
Because of you

Said you blow my mind, you sure look fine
You make my heart beat sweeter than
The honey that replaced the rain
Since I met you

I wanna know if it's good to you, baby
When you do what you do to me
I know that it must have been good to you, baby
Cause it sure feels good to me

Oh, do you feel the fire in your veins
Every time you call my name?
Do it give you the pleasure
To be the reason for me feeling good

Oh, yeah, ah ah ah whoa
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Look out here I come
(Here I come)
Right back where I started from
Look out here I come
Right back where I started from

Whoa, yeah, look out here I come
(Here I come)
Right back where I started from, yeah
Look out here I come
(Here I come)
