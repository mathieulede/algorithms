Before you think I love you
For just one thing
To you, my love, this might
Be the way that it seems

But I love the way
That you carry yourself
I even love the way
You wear your hair

Ain't that loving you?
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one?

Somehow our love
Has been misled
By a lot of things
That the other men said

But I love you, oh yes, I do
For what you are
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love
For what you're made of

Ain't that loving you?
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one?

Has it ever occurred to you
Why I do all that I can do?
Just to keep a little smile
Upon your face

It's because I love you
I love you, baby
In so many times

Somehow, our love
Has been misled
By a lot of things
That the other men said

But I love you, oh yes, I do
For what you are
Even love you, I love you
I love you, I love you
For that you made me become

Ain't that loving you?
Ain't that loving you
For more reasons than one?

Oh baby, I love the way
You kiss my lips
Oh baby, I love the way
You swivel your hips

Oh baby, I love the way
That you understand
Oh baby, I love the way
