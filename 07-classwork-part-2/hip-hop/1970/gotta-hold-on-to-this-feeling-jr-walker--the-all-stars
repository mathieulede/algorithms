The day without the shining sun
Is a day without your loving baby
One look, one look and well seem as one
That's how easy we communicate
A single match can make a fire begin
A single kiss and I'm warm within girl

Gotta hold on to this feeling
Gotta hold on to this feeling we got
Gotta hold on to this feeling
Gotta hold on to this feeling we got
Gonna blow, blow for ya
'Cause I love, love, love, ya now

Your love, your love got a hold on me now
Don't change, don't change and turn cold on me, girl
No how it's got a signed guarantee
Your warranty depends on me

If love, if love could sign a dotted line
It would surely fine your name next to mine
To be sure we keep the love we got
Just keep them kisses comin'
It ain't hard, girl

Gotta hold on to this feeling
Gotta hold on to this feeling we got now
Gotta hold on to this feeling
Gotta hold on to this feeling we got now
Gotta blow, blow, blow for ya
'Cause I love, love, love ya now
