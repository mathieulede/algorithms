Prettier than all the world
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you

You're only one fellow's girl
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
Believe me, I love you too

I'm so proud of being loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue

Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you

Compliments to you from all the people we meet
Yes, and I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
Believe me, I love you too

I'm so proud of being loved by you
I'm so proud of being loved by you
And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue

Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you

Compliments to you from all the people we meet
Yes, and I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
Believe me, I love you too
