Alright
Baby, you're alright
Ooh honey, you're alright

Farther on down the road
You will accompany, oh yeah
Farther on down the road
You will accompany, oh yeah

When I think back
Your love was like a sun
I don't remember the cold days
I just remember the warm

Farther on down the road
Girl, you will accompany, oh yes, you will

If a fusing life that I had before
I'd rather be, oh yeah
I'll be glad to learn from you and I know, good and well, honey
You'd be glad to learn from me, oh yeah

If we get down and things get sad
We can cheer up each other
And [Incomprehensible] things just ain't that bad

If a fusing life
That I'd had before, girl
I'd rather be

I'm happy
As long as you're with me
I don't have to worry
I love, I love you

Day by day
One step, one step at a time
You gave me so much love
Just an ease this old aching heart on mine, oh yeah

I don't know where they came from
And I don't know what they might say, woman
You always been in my heart

Oh, day by day
It's the magic of kindness
Flowing all the time, that's all love is

Farther on down the road
Girl, you will accompany, oh yes you will
I don't have to worry, baby
I do believe you'd love me
You'd love me, you'd love me
You'd love me, you'd love me
You know I'd love you too, honey
We don't have to worry

Farther on down the road
Evey thing gonna be alright
Alright, alright, alright
