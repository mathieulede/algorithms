Fellas, things done got too far gone
We gotta let the girls know what they gotta do for us!
It's done got to be a drag, man, a man can't do nothin' no more!
A-ha-ha-ha-ha!

It's really a drag!
You got to do somethin'!
Can I tell 'em?
Let me on!

Girl, let me tell you what you got to do
T.C.B. so mellow, 'til nobody can get through
When he asks you do you love him, smilin' and kiss his cheek
Walk away and twist your hip, make sure you keep him weak
Don't let nobody take care your business better than you do
Do what he wants, give what he wants, respect will come to you

And than you can hold your man, you can hold your man, you can hold your man, you can hold... hey!

Never get so confident so it's nothin' you want to know
Because that's the time you lose your thing, and then you got to blow
You know what we got...(indecipherable)
Use your thing so carefully and don't be a total loss
Sister, when you love your man, be careful how you tell him that
He will put you back in a corner, and use you like a Sunday hat

You can hold your man, you can hold your man, you can hold your man, you can
Hold... hey!

Hit it!

Good God, get it!

Hit me now!

Good God!

Never get too confident so it's nothin' you want to know
Because that's the time you lose your thing, then you got to blow
You know I got what it takes to be the untold boss
You gotta use it carefully and you can't be a total...

Hit me now!

Good God, Hit it!

Yeah!

Good god!
