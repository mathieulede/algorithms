You're a no good heartbreaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
I don't know why I let you do these thing to me
My friends keep telling me that you ain't no good

They don't know that I would leave you if I could
I guess I'm on tight
And I'm stuck like glue
'Cause I ain't never

I ain't never
I ain't never, no,no
Loved a man the way that I
I love you

Sometimes I know I thought
You would run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose

The way you treat me is shame
How could you hurt me so bad
Baby you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had
Kiss me once again

Don't you never never say that we're through
'Cause I ain't never
Never
Never no no
Loved a man the way that I
I love you

I can't sleep at night I can't eat a bite
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got your hooks in me

I ain't never loved a man
I ain't never loved a man
Ain't never loved a man that hurt me so bad
What am I gonna do about it
I tell you I'm gonna hold on to him
I'm gonna hold on to him
