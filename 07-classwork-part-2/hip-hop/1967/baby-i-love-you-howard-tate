In this world where people are fighting with each other
Nobody to count on
Not even your own brother
So if someone comes along
Who gives you genuine affection

Get it while you can
Get it while you can
Get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love

When you love somebody
You're taking a chance on sorrow
But who knows, baby
We may not be here tomorrow
So if someone comes your way
With love and protection

Get it while you can
Get it while you can
Get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love

I want to tell you a little bit about myself

Once I had a good women
But I didn't count my blessings
Oh I wish she could hear me
I've learned a big lesson
So if someone brings you love
Don't throw it away like I did

Get it while you can
Get it while you can
Get it while you can
Don't you turn your back on love

Get it while you can
