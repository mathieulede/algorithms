I lost at love before
Gave up and closed the door
But you said try just once more

I chose you for the one
Now I'm having so much fun
You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind

You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life

The others were untrue
But when it came to you
I'd spend my whole life with you

'Cause you came and took control
You touched my very soul
You always showed me that
Loving you is where it's at

You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life

I love you so much it seems
That you're even in my dreams
I can hear you calling me

I'm so in love with you
All I ever want to do
Is just thank you, baby
Thank you, thank you, baby

You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life

Thank you, baby
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life

One more time now
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
