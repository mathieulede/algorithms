Hey girl
You that I love so hard
You and your cold cold heart
Why do you hurt me

You've caused, me so much pain
Because of love I'm now insane
Your loving I needed
So why do you hurt me
You always hurt me

Can't you see my love oh darling
Why won't you love me as I love you
Why won't you mend this heart, this broken heart
Don't hurt me
You always hurt me

Another goal, you have achieved
So well I couldn't believe
Made me love and care, what wasn't there
You hurt me
You always hurt me

Can't you see my love oh darling
Why won't you love me as I love you
Why won't you mend this heart, this broken heart
Don't hurt me
You always hurt me, and you know it
You always hurt me, when you show it
You always hurt me, little girl now
You always hurt me
You always hurt me
You always hurt me
