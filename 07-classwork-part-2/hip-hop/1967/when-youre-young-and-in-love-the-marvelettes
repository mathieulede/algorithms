Spring in the air (filled with love)
There's magic ev'rywhere
When you're young and in love

Life seems to be (just a dream)
A world of fantasy
When you're young and in love

Each night seems just like the Fourth of July
When stars spangle the sky

The moon at night (shines so bright)
Seems to shine twice as bright
When you're young and in love

Ooh, dreams can come true (try a dream)
If you believe they do
When you're young and in love

Though many teardrops are bound to fall
True love can conquer all
When you're, when you're young and in love

(Look and you'll find)
Ooh, ooh yeah
(There's no mountain you can't climb)
When you're young and in love

Though many teardrops are bound to fall
True love can conquer all
When you're, when you're young and in love

(Young and in love)
So in love
(Young and in love)
Oh, yeah
(Young and in love)
I feel so good
