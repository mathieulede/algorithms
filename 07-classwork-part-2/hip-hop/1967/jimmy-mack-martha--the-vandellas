Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
My arms are missin' you
My lips feel the same way too
I've tried so hard to be true
Like I promised I'd do
But this boy keep's a comin' 'round
He's tryin' to wear my resistance down
Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Need your lovin'
Need your lovin'
He calls me on the phone
About three times a day
No, my heart's not listen' to
What he has to say
But this lonelieness I have within
Keeps reachin' out to be his friend
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Need your lovin'
Need your lovin'
Now, listen, boy
I'm not gettin' any stronger
I can't hold back very much longer
Tryin' hard to be true
But, Jimmy, he talks jus' as sweet as you
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Oh, Jimmy Mack, Jimmy
Oh, Jimmy Mack
When are you comin' back?
Need your lovin'
Need your lovin'
I'm not gettin' any stronger (ooh! )
Can't hold back very much longer (ooh! )
Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back?
Need your lovin' (oh, Jimmy Mack)
Need your lovin' (oh, Jimmy Mack)
