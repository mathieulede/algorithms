(To be a lover)
(To be a lover)
Haven't I proven in many ways
That with you is where I want to be
Haven't I shown you every day
Just how much you mean to me
But you keep on leading me
Leading me astray
Is this the price
That I have to pay
To be a lover, baby
(To be a lover)
To be a lover, baby
(To be a lover)
Haven't I done just what you wanted
And I been there whenever you call
Haven't I tried to please you, baby
Haven't I given you my all and all
I ask myself every day
Is this the price
That I have to pay
If I'm not, I'm not
The one that you wanted
Then why won't you turn me
Loose, loose, loose, baby
Why do you wanna hold
Hold on to me
When you know it ain't no use
It seems you wanna keep me
Your puppet on a string
Sometimes, baby
It's a hurting thing
To be a lover
(To be a lover)
Oh, to be a lover
(To be a lover)
Don't you know it's so
Rough and tough out here
Trying to be your lover, baby
(To be a lover)
So why won't you turn me
Loose, loose, loose, baby
