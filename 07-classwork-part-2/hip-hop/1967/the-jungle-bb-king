I may go and move to the jungle now
Way out in the woods
Yes, I think I'll move to the jungle people
Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now
Well, I ain't doin' myself no good
I work hard everyday
From Monday to Friday night

The wages that they pay me
I swear that they're very light
The take out a little for the state
A little more for Uncle Sam

How can I ever catch up
And get myself out of this jam
Yes, I think I'll move to the jungle
Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now
Well, I ain't doin' myself no good
I go to town on Saturday
Just to pay my bills

I better make it early
Or the collector will come where I live
I got to church on a Sunday
I get on my knees to pray

Preacher takes up collection
And say brother what will you pay
I think I'll move to the jungle
Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now
Well, I ain't doin' myself no good
