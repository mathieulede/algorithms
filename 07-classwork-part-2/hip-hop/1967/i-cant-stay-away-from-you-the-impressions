I can't stay away from you
No, I can't stay away from you
Though I know you're no good
And I'd leave you if I could
Yet I can't stay away from you

The old times with you and me
That's the way now, it ought to be
You were all I'd ever dream
And now you're so mean
Yet I can't stay away from you

You've been leaving me
And deceiving me
And told me lie after lie
The pain is so bad
I'm going mad
Yet there's no tears in my eyes
Oh no

Yet I can't stay away from you
I can't stay away from you
Though I know you're no good
And I'd leave you if I could
Yet I can't stay away from you

I can't stay away (I can't stay away)
I can't stay away (I can't stay away)
I can't stay away (you're my one girl)
I can't stay away (and I can't stay away)
