Ahh, I'm gonna miss you
Ahh, I'm gonna miss you

From the day I
Laid my eyes on you
I knew, girl, you were
My dream come true

I tried so hard
Not to confess
That you were the only one
To insure my happiness

Your sweet loving
I can't resist
Your sweet loving
I'm gonna miss

Ahh, I'm gonna miss you, baby
Ahh, I know I'm gonna miss you

A kiss goodbye could
Put a flame in my heart
Loving you so
It tears me all apart

My lonely days
And my lonely nights
Oh, how I dream of
Holding you tight

Your sweet loving
I can't resist
(And I know)
Your sweet loving
I'm gonna miss

Ahh, I'm gonna miss you, every day
Ahh, I'm gonna miss you, baby

I love you with all my heart
We said we'd never part
Until the day I die
Though you're gone
I still cry

I love you forever
The memory will always
Remain in my heart

I know I'm gonna miss you, baby
I, I'm gonna miss you
No more kisses, baby...
