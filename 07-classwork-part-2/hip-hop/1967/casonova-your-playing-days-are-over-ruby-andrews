Hey, boy
Yes or no, boy
But later, baby
Your playing days are over
You'll play no more
Around this town
(Play no more
Around this town)
Cause I am gonna
Shoot you down
Hey, Casonova
Your playing days are over
Casonova
Your playing days are over
It's all over, Casonova
It's all over, Casonova
It's all over, Casonova
It's all over, Casonova
Hey, boy, they say
That you're contrary
Cause you think your love
Is extra ordinary
But I'm gonna show
You what I'm worth
(I'm gonna show you
What I'm worth)
I'm bringing good to Earth
Hey, Casonova
Your playing days are over
Casanova, I said
Your playing days are over
It's all over, Casonova
It's all over, Casonova
It's all over, Casonova
It's all over, Casonova
It's all over, Casonova
It's all over, Casonova
It's all over, Casonova
It's all over, Casonova...
