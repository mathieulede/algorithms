I never had a love to call my own
I was about to give up
And then you came along
Just to have your tender kiss
Thrills me for days and days
I don't care what nobody says
I want you for always
Now that I found you
I want to stay around
So make me yours, make me yours
You already captured my heart and my soul
Now I want you to take full control
I need the love that only you can give
If I can't have it
I don't want to live
I never had a love so sweet
I never thought I'd be lucky enough to meet
A guy with all your charms to hold me with loving arms
Make me feel secure and warm
Caused my heart to run
Now that I found you
I want to stay around
So, make me yours, make me yours
Now that I found you I want to stay around
So, make me yours, make me yours
Take me baby if you want me to be
So, whatever you need you can always fine in me
Yeah love me and keep me by your side
Wherever you go I'll always be satisfied
All of my friends said girl don't
But I know what I need and I know what I want
I want to be yours
You're the only one
And I will give to you happiness in return
Cause what you need, baby I've got it
What you got, I'm just crazy about it
If you're looking for a love that you'll never get tired of
Make me yours, make me yours
Baby, make me yours
Not just for a little while
But forever my darling, make me yours
