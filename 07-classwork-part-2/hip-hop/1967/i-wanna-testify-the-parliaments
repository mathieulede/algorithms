Friends, inquisitive friends
Are asking me what's come over me
A change, there's been a change
And it's oh so plain to see
Love just walked in on me
And it's taken me by surprise
Happiness surrounds me
You can see it in my eyes
Now it was just a little while ago
My life was incomplete
I was down, so doggone low
I had to look up at my feet

Don't you know, I want to testify
What your love has done for me
Everybody sing, I just want to testify
Oh girl, what your love has done for me

Hum - mmmm luscious
Sure been delicious to me
Hear me now, hum-mmmmmmm
Luscious, sure been delicious to me

Once I was a hollow man
In which a lonely heart did dwell
Then love came sneaking up on me
Bringing hope to an empty shell
Now I've heard so many times before
That your love can be so bad
But I just want to tell you people
It's the best love I ever had

Talkin' 'bout, I just want to testify
What your love has done for me
Everybody sing (oh girl) I just want to testify
What your love has done for me

Hear me now, hummmmmmm
(Luscious) sure been delicious to me
Bring it home now, I just want to testify
What you love has done for me

Everybody sing, I just want to testify
What your love has done for me
