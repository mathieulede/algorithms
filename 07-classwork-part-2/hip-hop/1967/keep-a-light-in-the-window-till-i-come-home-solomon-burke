Now it was just the other day
These are the words I heard a soldier sing
He said, "Tell my babe
To keep a light in the window
Till I come home, till I come home"

Well, I don't know
How long or how soon
Maybe tomorrow, it may be never
Or maybe this afternoon

Somebody tell my baby
To please keep a light, keep a light
Keep a light in the window
Till I come home, home, home

Now darlin' you know
How much I need you
You see I been gone
So long, so long

But there's nothing
Will ever change the way I feel
I'm just asking you to hold on, baby
Please hold on, listen

I'm risking my life every day
To end this fight
But deep down inside my soul right now
I believe I know, I said, I know this cause is right

I just want you, baby
Please keep a light
Keep a light burning
In the window
Till I, till I, till I, till I, till I come on home again
