Calling your name, Peaches
Calling your name, Peaches
In my lonely, lonely room, there's nothing left but the past
I think of how, my love, you speak
And why it didn't last, I think of how sweet all the love was
All the good times we had
I want you to come home, cause I feel so all alone
And I feel so sad
Calling out your name, Peaches
The whispers gettin louder
Calling your name, Peaches
Don't you hear, Peaches
Don't you hear it, little baby?
Every time I think about you
I can hear you calling my name
And every time I'm all alone
The whispers be come back again
Don't you hear it, Peaches?
Don't you hear it, little baby?
The whispers gettin louder
Whispers gettin louder
Calling your name
Hear it baby
Calling to you Peaches
Fades... louder, baby...
