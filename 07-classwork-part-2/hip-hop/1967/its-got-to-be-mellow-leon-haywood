Yeah, yeah, it's got to be mellow
Got to be mellow

'Cause my baby loves me and I'm her only fellow
Crazy about my baby, crazy about my baby
And it's plain to see she's crazy about me
Crazy 'bout me, yeah

She's got class and she's got style
A personality that drives me wild
She's not a put-on and she's not make believe
She don't mind sharing love so that she may receive

She's mellow
(It's got to be mellow)
Yes, my baby's mellow
(It's got to be mellow)

And oh yeah
(She's my baby and I love her)
And I'm her only fellow
(And I place no one above her)
Ooh, yeah, yeah

It's got to be mellow
(It's got to be mellow)
Got to be mellow
(It's got to be mellow)

'Cause my baby loves me
(She's my baby and I lover her)
And I'm her only fellow
(And I place no one above her)

Crazy about my baby, crazy about my baby
And it's plain to see she's crazy about me
Crazy bout me, yeah, she's alright
Love is uptight
