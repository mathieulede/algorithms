Tramp
You can call me that
I don't wear continental clothes
Stetson hats

But I'm a lover
Mama was
Papa too
I'm the oldest child
Lovin' is all I know to do

Huh
Call me country
Right from the woods
I'll answer when you call me
Huh baby, I mean that if it, ah, makes you feel good

But I'm just a lover
Mama was
Papa too
But I'm the oldest child
Lovin' is all I know to do

Now whatever you call me
Huh, I'll even go for that
'Cause I keep a fat bankroll in my pocket, baby
You know I own three Cadillacs

'Cause I'm just a lover
Mama was
Papa too
I'm the oldest child
Lovin' is all I know to do
