[Verse 1: Marvin Gaye]
Listen, baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby

[Tammi Terrell]
If you need me, call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far (don't worry, baby)
Just call my name
I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
Cause baby there

[Hook: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

[Verse 2: Marvin Gaye]
Remember the day
I set you free
I told you you could always count on me, darling
From that day on, I made a vow
I'll be there when you want me
Someway, somehow
Cause baby there

[Hook: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

[Bridge: Marvin Gaye]
Oh no, darling

[Tammi Terrell]
No wind, no rain
Nor winter storm
Can't stop me baby

[Marvin Gaye]
No no baby

[Tammi Terrell]
Cause you are my goal

[Marvin Gaye]
If you're ever in trouble
I'll be there on the double
Just send for me

[Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Oh baby!

[Verse 3]
My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart

[Marvin Gaye]
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double
Just as fast as I can

[Both]
Don't you know that there...

[Hook: Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
