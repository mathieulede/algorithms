Ooooh
Lonely man am I, ever since you said goodbye, girl I know that I should have woke up, cuz it seems now that we've broke up
Your fairwell kiss is haunting mee, my two lips cry out constantly
Let your heart let your heart be your guide
(forget about your foolish prid)
Forget about your foolish pride

(Baby I keep tellin, I keep tellin, baby I keep tellin)
Starting tomorrow I keep telling myself
Im gonna get out and find me somebody else
Somebody thats sweet and kind who will erase you out of my miiind
But tell me how can I find somebody new baby
When my two arms keep reaching out for you
And my two lips keep right on repeating
Its you that I need oooooohh
You know that even when I close my eyes to forget ya
I see your face and your memories too
Girl I've never felt this lonelyness before, and hooo girl I just can't take it no more

Every night a million tears I shed, Girl
Girl I'm only goin out of my head, just take a good look and you'll see what this lonelyness is doin to meee
(uh baby its you that need) ooooh dont you know that its you that I need (baaaby) Oh I can't take this loneliness, (its you that I need) Awww baby I need ya, (Its you that I need) oooooh (?? Baby)

(You that I need)
Some fool im gonna be no more
Cuz I'll soon be knockin', knockin' on your door
Gonna get down on my bending knees
Beg and plead giiirl come back to me
Its you that I need (ever night a million tears I shed) giirl its you that I need (every morning goin out of my head) girl take a good look and you'll see a , what does this loneliness
