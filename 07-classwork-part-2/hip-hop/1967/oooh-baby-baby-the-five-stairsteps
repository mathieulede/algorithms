I did you wrong
My heart went out to play
But in the game I lost you
What a price to pay
Hey, I'm cryin'

Ooh whooh ooh baby baby
Ooh whooh ooh baby baby

Mistakes, I know I've made a few
But I'm only human
You've made mistakes too
I'm cryin'

Ooh whooh ooh baby baby
Whooh ooh whooh ooh ooh baby baby

I'm just about at
The end of my rope
But I can't stop cryin
I can't give up hope
Cause I, I feel one day I'll hold you near
Whisper I still love you
Until that day is here
I'm cryin'

Ooh whooh ooh baby baby
Whooh ooh whooh ooh ooh baby baby
Whooh whooh whooh whooh whooh whooh baby baby
