[Verse 1]
Like a long lonely stream
I keep running towards a dream
Moving on, moving on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reaching to be free
Moving on, moving on

[Chorus 1]
Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's got to run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

[Verse 2]
Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Moving on, moving on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rolling since my birth
Moving on, moving on

[Chorus 1]
Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's got to run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun

[Bridge]
You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember

[Chorus 2]
Yes, there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's got to run
There's a place in the sun
