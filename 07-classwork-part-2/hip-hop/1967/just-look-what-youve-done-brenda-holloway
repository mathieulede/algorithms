With a tender love, you filled my lonely days
You made me need you, darlin', in so many ways
But you no longer come around very much
& lately there's no tenderness in your touch
Where did it go? That warm & tender feeling
Where did it go? The love that I believed in?
You filled my life with so much meaning
It's empty now, now that you're leaving

Chorus:
Just look what you've done; you've turned my dreams to dust
I thought you needed me, but now I find that you're leavin' me
Oh you've turned my heart to stone
Without you by my side, where will I get the strength to carry on?

Now helplessly I stand, watchin' love walk away
There's nothin' I can do, nothin' I can say
For you our love was just a passin' thing
But to me, my darlin', it was everything
Where did it go? The love I always turned to
Where did it go? Where do I go without you?
When I needed you, you were always there
I'm nothing now without your love to share

(chorus)
(instrumental)

Where did it go? The love I always turned to
Where did it go? & where do I go without you?
When I needed you, you were always there
I'm nothing now without your love to share

(repeat chorus & fade)
