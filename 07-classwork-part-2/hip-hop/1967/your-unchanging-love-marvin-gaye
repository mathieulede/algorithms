[Chorus]
I'm going to hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on
To your unchanging love
I'm going to hold on (hold on) hold on (hold on
To your unchanging love
I need you baby, baby I need you right now

[Verse 1]
Darling, there comes a time in everybody's life
They may learn as I've learned
That being loved is more important than painting the town
Only noon and night
Cause my life may have bright lights
But I've learned in time they go dim
But your love and tender arms, I can always come home to them

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I used to have more friends than I could count
But now all of my so-called friends are gone
Cause I've lost everything in my bank account
Darling, I'm tired of running 'round
So in your arms I'm gonna settle down
Cause if I don't have a dime, I know your love is mine

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Darling, everybody need somebody, o I need you
I know now, nobody really loves me, honey honey honey, the way you do
One more thing
I've changed, girl, through my life as often as I change my suits
Only to learn the only true happiness is being, honey, being loved by you
That's why

[Chorus]
