I move your picture
From my wall
And I replace them
Both large and small
And each new day
Finds me so blue
Nothing
Takes the place of you
I read your letters
One by one
And I still love you
When it's all said and done
And oh, my darling
I am so blue
Because nothing
Oh, nothing
Takes the place of you

I

I write this letter
It's raining on my
Windowpane

I

I feel the need of you
Because without you
Nothing seems the same
And so I'll wait
Until you're home
Again I'll love you
But I am all alone
And oh my darling
I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh, but nothing
Takes the place of you
