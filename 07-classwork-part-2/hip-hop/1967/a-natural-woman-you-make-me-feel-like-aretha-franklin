Looking out on the morning rain (a-ooh)
I used to feel uninspired (a-ooh)
And when I knew I had to face another day (a-ooh)
Lord, it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
But you're the key to peace my mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

When my soul was in the lost-and-found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it

Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy I don't need to do more

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

Oh, baby, what you've done to me? (What you've done to me?)
You make me feel so good inside (good inside)
And I just wanna be (wanna be)
Close to you, you make me feel so alive

You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

You make me feel
You make me feel
