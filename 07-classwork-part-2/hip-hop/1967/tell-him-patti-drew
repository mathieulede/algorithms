If you ever see
The boy for me

Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
If he ever needs me
Tell him I'll be there

It happened the other night
We argued but we didn't fight
He grabbed his hat
And slammed the door and
He hasn't been back no more

If and how you can
See my man

Tell him that I need him
Tell him he was right
Tell him that I miss him
Each and every night

I didn't mean what I said
Tell him I was wrong
Yours sincerely written
Tell him to come back
Where he belongs

If you ever find
That love of mine

Tell him to forgive me
Tell him don't be mean
I didn't mean to start it
I wish it was all just a dream

Tell him, tell him, oh
How much I want him
Oh, how much I need him
How much I want him
