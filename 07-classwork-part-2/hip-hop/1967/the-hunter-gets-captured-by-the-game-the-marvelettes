Every day
Things change
And the world puts on a new face
Certain things rearrange
And this whole world seems like a new place

Oh, yeah
Secretly I've been trailing you
Like a fox that prays on the rabbit
I had to get you
And so I knew
I had to learn your ways and your habits

Ooooh
You were the catch that I was after
But I looked up
And I was in your arms
And I knew I had been captured

What's this whole world coming to?
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game

Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah
I had laid such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it

But love hit me like a sudden slap
One kiss
And then I knew it

Ooooh
My plan didn't work out like I thought
I had laid my trap for you
But it seems that I got caught

What's this whole world coming to?
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game

Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
