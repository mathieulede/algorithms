I made you think
You don't understand
But remember I'm only doing
The best I can

Every little thing I do
I'm just trying to get
Closer to you

(Nearer, nearer)

I'm sorry if I seem, ooh, yeah
A little bit stubborn sometimes
I hope I'm not being
A nuisance to you

I know you said
That you'd be home soon
I got to be nearer
Nearer to you

Every little thing I do
I'm just trying to get
Closer to you

(Nearer, nearer)

Every little thing I do
I'm just trying to get
Closer to you

I got to be nearer
Nearer to you
