Everything is alright
(Everything is alright)
From out of the darkness
Into the light
You gave me hope, baby
You gave me sight
You gave me something
That I could be proud of
You gave me comfort
Darling, you gave me love
Inspiration
(Came from your embrace)
And there's no one
That can take your place
I never had a love
Like this before
And with you here
I won't go back no more
You gave me something
That everyone lives for
The joy that makes
Life so grand
You filled my heart
With something so special
That brings out the best
In a man, ooh, ooh
And that was love
Ooh, ooh, a special love
You gave me something
That never grows old
A treasure more precious
Than diamonds and gold
Something to live for
To dwell in my heart
To love and to cherish
Till death do us part
Everything is alright
(Two hearts beat as one)
We've got a love
That outshines the sun
My whole life before me
It's perfectly clear
Now there's one thing
I want the whole world to hear
Baby, you gave me something
That everyone lives for
The joy that makes
Life so grand
You filled my heart
With something so special
That brings out the best
In a man, ooh, ooh
And that was love
Ooh, ooh, a special love
Everything is alright
(Everything is alright)
You gave me something
More precious than gold
(Everything is alright)
You gave me something
That will never go away, baby
(Everything is alright)
Everything is alright
(Everything is alright)
You gave me something so wonderful
