[Verse 1]
I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I was hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then

[Verse 2]
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her"
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years

[Verse 4]
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 5]
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
Cause I love my baby, love my baby
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere

[Verse 6]
I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there

[Verse 7]
Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah!
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
