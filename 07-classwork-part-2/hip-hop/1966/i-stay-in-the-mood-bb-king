Yeah, I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself
Yeah, I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself
You've always fooling around, givin' my love to somebody else

Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I go
Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I go

Well, if something soon don't happen, my heart is gonna break I know

Well, you said that you love me, you've sworn that you'll be true
But now you're tellin' stronger, that I'm just a fool you know
But I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself
Please come back to me baby, 'cause I'm tired of livin' by myself
