Doo doo doo doo doo
It's a world of fantasy

It's a world where I am never alone
It's a world of sheer make-believe
Where all young lovers have gone
To set their hearts?

I go there whenever I feel the need
To make life have a new face
No one intrudes on my privacy
To me it's the most wonderful place

I go there whenever I feel the need
To make life have a new face
No one intrudes on my privacy
To me it's the most wonderful place

It is where no problems lie
And lovers we all become
We live with love and never cry
'Cause in love the sum is one plus one

So come on love and follow me
To my world of
Come my love
Come to my world of fantasy
