You are so much cool one, I don't worry about a thing
You are pushin' full of lovin' that makes my heart sing
I know that you want me & you prove it every day
You're the kind of girl I can find giving my birds and I say

Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
Said I wasn't gonna tell a soul
Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
But I, oh I, oh I, I couldn't keep it to myself

Baby I'm so proud I'm really gonna scream out loud
I can't hold it any longer, your love talk is getting stronger
Just one look in your eyes can make a young man cry
Said I couldn't advertise, but baby you apologize

Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
Said I wasn't gonna tell a soul
Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
But I, oh I, oh I, I couldn't keep it to myself

Look, your love is harder than the hardest rock
Ooo it's shocking like electric wire

Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
Said I wasn't gonna tell a soul
Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody
But I, oh I, oh I, I couldn't keep it to myself
