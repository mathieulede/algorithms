Chorus:
I can't believe you love me
No I can't believe you love me
No I can't believe that you love me
I can't believe that you love me
Anymore, not like before

Whenever we're together, not a word do you say
When I speak your name in the softest tone
It's as though I'm all alone
That's why...

(Chorus)
(I can't believe that you love me) (x4)
Anymore, not like before

You don't kiss me like you used to
You don't say those pretty words
There's no thrill in your kiss, there's no sincerity
I do believe you've gotten over me

(Repeat chorus and fade)
