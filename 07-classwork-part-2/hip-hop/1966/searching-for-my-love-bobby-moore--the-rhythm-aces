Searching, searching for my baby
Yes, I am
Searching, searching for my baby
Yes, I am
Searching, searching for my baby
I'm searching, searching for my love
I'm searching for the one I adore
If I find her, you know I will
I'll never, never let her go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll never, never let her go now, baby
I love you, I need you
I need you by my side
For my love, for my true love
Ill never, never never hide now, baby
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'll never, never, never hide, no, no
I wonder, I wonder why
You had to leave me this way
I'm sorry, darling
That I made you cry
Forgive me, love, for the
Things I've done to you
Come along, come along
Come along, give me one more try
Searching, baby
I'm searching, searching for my love
I'm searching for the one I adore
And if I find her
I'll never, never let her go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Searching, searching for my baby)
I'll never, never let her go
(Yes, I am)
(Searching, searching for my baby)
Make it, make it on my own
(Searching, searching for my baby)
I get so lonely sometimes
