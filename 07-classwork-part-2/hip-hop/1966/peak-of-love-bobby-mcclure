I've heard of love
That makes you shiver
That's what I want
That's what I want

I've heard of kisses
That make your liver quiver
That's what I want
That's what I want

I wanna reach the peak of love
I wanna reach the peak of love
That's what I want
That's what I want

I've read books of boss lovers
That's what I want
A boss lover

I've seen movies
Where love's discovered
That's what I want
I wanna discover

I wanna reach the peak of love
Baby, I got to reach the peak of love
Ooh, I wanna reach the peak of love
That's what I want
That's what I want

I'm gonna do all the things
I've heard and seen
I want action and all that
I'm gonna try everything, yes, I am
Right down to the fraction, oh, yeah

I've heard of love
That makes you shiver
That's what I want
That's what I want

I've heard of kisses
That makes your liver quiver
That's what I want
That's what I want

I wanna reach the peak of love
Baby, I wanna reach the peak of love
That's what I want
That's what I want

Ooh, I wanna reach the peak of love
Baby, I got to reach the peak of love
That's what I want
That's what I want

Ooh, I wanna reach the peak of love
Girl, I got to reach the peak of love
Ooh wee, baby

I wanna reach the peak of love
I got to reach the peak of love
Ooh wee, reach the peak of love
Baby, I wanna reach the peak of love
