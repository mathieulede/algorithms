You don't know
How I feel
You'll never know
How I feel
When I needed you
To come around
You always try
To bring me down

Oh, but I know, girl
Believe me when I say that
You
Are surely, surely gonna pay, girl

But it's all right
All right girl
You can hurt me
But it's all right

Hey now, one day
Ah, you will see
You'll never find
A guy like me
Who'll love you right
Both day and night
You'll never have to worry
'Cause it's all uptight

Oh, but I'm tellin' you girl
And I know that it's true
That I
Was made to love only you, girl

But it's all right
All right girl
You can hurt me
But it's all right
Go on, yeah

Oh, yeah

Oh, yeah
My my my baby
Wow, yeah!

But it's all right all right girl
Hey, say
It’s all right all right girl

Now there's one thing
I wanna say, hey, yeah
You'll meet a guy
Who’ll make you pay
He'll treat you bad
And make you sad
And you will lose
The love you had

Oh, but I hate
To say I told you so, but
Baby, you gotta gotta reap what you sow

But it's all right
All right girl
You are payin' now
But it's all right
So goodbye, now
Goodbye, girl
You're payin' now
So bye-bye
You hurt me once
You hurt me twice
Oh, but-a baby
That don't cut no ice
Hey, goodbye, baby
