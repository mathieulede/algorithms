Ooh baby, recovery
I'm falling again happiness is in my heart, yeah
Though you misuse me, and false accuse me
I've gotten to understand
You treated me like a heart that was used
But I've gotten over you
My heart is free it's my recovery
I'm feeling better

I feel good inside the heartache and pain have gone, yeah
You want my love, but next time you come along, yeah
You treated me like a heart that was used
But I've gotten over you
My heart is free it's my recovery
I'm feeling better. (Recovery)
So much better

I've got peace of mind this heartache I've left behind, yeah
(Left behind, yeah)
And now I'm laughing and you'll never catch me crying, yeah
You treated me like a heart that was used
But I've gotten over you
My heart is free it's my recovery
I'm feeling better. (Recovery)
So much better

Recovery, my heart is free
Feeling better (feeling better)
So much better (so much better)
Feeling better (feeling better)
I feel, I feel...
Mmm mmm hmm (Mmm mmm hmm)
Mmm mmm hmm (Mmm mmm hmm)
Hmm hmm (Hmm hmm)
Mmm hmm hmm hmm (Mmm hmm hmm hmm)
