It used to be
I recall you were mine alone
But now I see
You wanna be left on your own
You must have someone new
To make me go through black nights

Oh, it used to be
We could have so much fun
Just you and me
When our workin' day was done

But now when I get home
To retire these bones

Black nights

It used to be
When you see my face you would smile
And comfort me
Your love me just like a child

But now you're in some kind of daze
Little girl, you've changed your ways

Black nights

It used to be
Blacks nights were never known
Now it's plain to see
I have these blues, now come on

Your love for me is softer than ever
And you'll soon be on yourself

Black nights
