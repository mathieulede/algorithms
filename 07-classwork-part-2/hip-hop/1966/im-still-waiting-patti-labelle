Time will
Take this pain from my heart
When will
When will time start?
Tell me
When can I
When will the time be right
If love won't let me forget
Maybe time will
They say in time
A heart can love again
But they can't
Stop this heart from breaking
I can't stop this pain inside
I listen to all the friendly advice
But I can't sleep at night
I'll be fine
They tell me
Time will
Take this pain from my heart
When will
When will time start?
Tell me
When can I go on with my life
When will that time be right
If love won't let me forget
Maybe time will
Oh, time will
They say in time a heart can love again
But they can't
Stop this heart from breaking
I can't chase your from my mind
I've listened to all the friendly advice
But I can't sleep at night
I'll be fine
They tell me
Oh yeah, hey
Will it take it from my heart
When?
When will it start?
When will I go on?
When will the time be right?
Let me forget, maybe time will
Oh, there'll be a day
When the tears no longer fall
I see a day
I'll be through it all
When each day feels like this
And I'm still drowning in tears
And I'm still dying inside
Waiting for the time
When time will
Oh, from my heart
Oh, when can I go on
With me life?
Baby, baby, baby
Oh, oh
If I'm not over you yet
If love won't let me forget
Maybe, baby, baby
Time will
It will take the pain from my heart
Time will let me forget oh
When can I
Go on with my life
If love won't let me forget
Maybe time will
Oh
Maybe time will
