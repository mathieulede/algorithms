[Chorus]
Oh, it's crying time again, you're going to leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling, ooh
That it won't be long before it's crying time

[Verse 1]
Now they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder
(Fonder)
And that tears are only rain to make love grow
Well, my love for you could never grow no stronger
(Stronger)
If I lived to be a hundred years old

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now you say you've found someone that you love better
(Better)
That's the way it's happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
('Morrow)
Crying time will start when you walk out the door

[Chorus]

[Outro]
That it won't be long before it's crying time
