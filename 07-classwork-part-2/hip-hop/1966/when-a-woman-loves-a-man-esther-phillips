When a woman loves a man
Can't keep her mind on nothing else
She change the world for the good things she's found
If he is bad she can't see it
He can do no wrong
Turn her back on her best friend
If she puts him down

When a woman loves a man
She’ll spend all of her time
Trying to hold on to what she needs
She'll give up all her comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If he says that’s the way it ought to be

Well this woman really loves you
I gave you everything I had
Try to hold on, to your unwelcome love
Baby please don't treat me bad

When a woman loves a man
Deep down in her soul
He can bring her such misery
If he plays her for a fool
She’s the very last one to know
Loving eyes can never see

Chorus
When a woman loves a man
She’ll never, never do him wrong
Any friend in this whole wide world
Yes when a woman loves a man
I know exactly how I feel
Cause baby, baby I’m your friend
Yes when a woman loves a man
I know exactly how I feel
