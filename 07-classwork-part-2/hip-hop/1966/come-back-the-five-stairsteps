Baby, this year I've been born again
But don't change your love, don't change
'Cause you're gonna get me broke

Baby, don't change your love, don't change it
I'm in love and if it's all the same, don't change
Baby, don't change, come on now
I love you, you know it

Don't change your ways in two if I'm losing you
So don't change your love, don't change
Might be a little lazy but I'm going crazy

Baby, don't change your love, don't change
I'm in love and if it's all the same, don't change
Baby, don't change, come on now
I love you, you know it too

So don't change your ways in two if I'm losing you
So don't change your love, don't change
I might be a little lazy, you're going crazy

Don't change your love, don't change
Now I'm in love and if it's all the same
Don't change, baby, don't change, here we go

Now, I love you, you know it too
So don't change your ways
Now I love you and you know it too
Baby, don't change your way

Jump back, I love you, you know it too
