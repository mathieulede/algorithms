(Come on and see me, baby)
(Come on and see me, baby)
(Come on and see me, baby)

If you need a lover truer than any other
Come on and see me
If you need a heart that will never tear apart
Come on and see me
'Cause I've got a true love just for you, love
And it can be yours eternally
If you want it, you better come and get it
I say, if you want it, better come and get it

If you need a lover that'll stick right by you, brother
Come on and see me
I'll stand by your side, I'll dry your weepin' eyes
Come on and see me
'Cause I've got joy love for some boy love
And it can be yours eternally
If you want it, you better come and get it
I say, if you want it, better come and get it

Baby, come on and see me
And I'm truly your love, come on and see me
And I'm all yours honey, come on and see me
Baby, come on and see me
I've got joy love for some boy love
And it can be yours eternally

(Repeat and fade):
If you want it, better come and get it
Baby, come on and see me
