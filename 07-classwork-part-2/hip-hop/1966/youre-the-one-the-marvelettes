A closet full of glad rags
All tucked away in a bed that's swank
Two sedans and the latest sports car
Plus a lot of money in the bank

Baby, just give me you
In a love affair made for two
Don't make no mistake
About which one I would take

You're the one
(You're the one)
You're the one
(You're the one)

You're the one
(You're the one)
The only one
(The only one)

An all expense paid trip around the world
To see the sights I've read about
To travel 'round the world for 'most any girl
Would be a guess beyond a doubt

But if I had to choose between the trip and you
There would be only one thing that I could do
I don't have to come out and say my choice
You can tell by the sound of my voice that

You're the one
(You're the one)
You're the one
(You're the one)

You're the one
(You're the one)
The only one
(The only one)

To go to parties and to dances
And to be the belle of every ball
To have the guys line up for chances
Beggin' me to dance with one and all

Now give me just your romance
You don't even have to know how to dance
I don't need those other guys
You can tell by the look in my eyes that

You're the one
(You're the one)
You're the one
(You're the one)

You're the one
(You're the one)
The only one
(The only one)
