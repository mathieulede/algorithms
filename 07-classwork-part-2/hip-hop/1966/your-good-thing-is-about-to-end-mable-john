[Verse 1]
I don't have to beg you to hold me
Cause somebody else will
You don't have to love me when I want it
Cause somebody else will
Your so-called friends saying you don't need it
When all the time they're trying to get it

[Hook]
Look out - Your good thing
Is about to come to an end
Your real good thing
Is about, to come to an end

[Verse 2]
All those nights I watched the four walls
I did not have to watch them all alone
Whenever men said they wanted me
I didn't have to tell them I was your very own
You have all the love I've got
Even ice melts to water

[Hook]
Look out - Your good thing
Is about, to come to an end
Your real good thing
Is about to end

[Verse 3]
Getting myself back together
Is gonna be a big problem, I know
But when the right man says he wants me
You can bet I won't say no

[Hook]
Because your real good thing
Is about to end
Your real good thing
Is about to come to an to end
