I had a dream last night, love is worryin' me
I claim the only woman that I've ever loved
Don't you know she turned her back on me
Let tell you little more about this dream

I dream I was workin' in graveyard shift
Five long nights a week
And when I left home to go to work that night
My baby was fast asleep

But I took sick on my job and I had to go home
And when I got there I found my baby ain't there
And my baby, she was gone

I shouldn't let this worry me, it all happened in my sleep
But the thing that worries me so bad
I got to stop from eleven to seven next week
And that's why I'm tellin' you I had a dream

Oh, this dream is worryin' me, yeah, oh, yes it is
You see, I claim the only woman that I've ever loved
Before she turned her back on me, oh yes she did

Oh, don't you know I had a dream last night?
Oh, don't you know it's worryin' me
It worry me all day long, a dream that I had last night
I dreamed my baby had found somebody else

I dream I dream I dream, oh, yes I did
