Once upon a time
A long, long time ago
Wherever you'd lead me
I would surely follow

Girl, you put me through
Some pain and misery
And now you're
Standing on my doorstep
Telling me how much you need me

[Chorus]
Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home (nobody's home)

How many times I begged
For you to come home
But you laughed at me
And said let me alone

Through my burning tears
I saw you walk away
And now you beg me to forgive you
But this time, baby
It's your turn to beg

[Chorus]

Girl, I used to love you
Place no one else above you
Gave you everything that I own
Girl, you can't come back here
Ain't nobody home

Once upon a time
When you went on your way
How I hoped and prayed
That you'd come back some day

But time has made some changes
Turned me upside down
So, you can beg me to forgive you
But this time, baby
You can turn right around

[Chorus]
