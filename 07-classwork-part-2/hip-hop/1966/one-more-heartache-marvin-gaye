[Verse 1]
One more heartache, I can't take it
My heart is carrying such a heavy load
One more ache would break it
Just like the camel with the heavy back
One last straw was added, they say it broke the camel's back

[Chorus]
Ah (ah) ah (ah)
I can't take it, I can't stand it

[Verse 2]
One more heartache, it would turn me right around
First you build my hopes up high and then you let me down
Like the house you built from toothpicks stacked upon the kitchen table
One last toothpick tore it down; the foundation was not able

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh baby, one more heartache would be too much load
I'm fed up with the heartaches; one more and I will explode
Like the toy balloon that's filled with as much air as it can take
One more puff of air and that balloon has got to burst

[Chorus]
