Where did you go when things went wrong baby?
Who did you run to
And find a shoulder to lay your head upon?
Baby wasn't I there?
Didn't I take good care of you?
No no, I can't believe you're leaving me

Stay with me baby
Please, stay with me baby
Ooh, stay with me baby
I can't go on

Who did you touch when you needed tenderness?
I gave you so much
And in return I found happiness
Baby what did I do
Maybe, maybe I was too good, too good to you
No no, I can't believe you're leaving me

Stay with me baby
Ooh, stay with me baby
Ooh, please stay with me baby

Remember you said you'd always gonna need me
Remember you said you'd never ever leave me
Remember, remember, I'm asking you, begging you, ooh, ooh

Stay with me baby
Please please stay with me baby
Stay with me baby
I can't go on

Ooh stay with me baby
I'm begging you, stay with me baby
Stay, stay, stay with me baby
