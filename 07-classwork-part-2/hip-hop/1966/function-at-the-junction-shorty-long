I'm getting ready for the function at the junction
And baby you'd better come on right now
Because everybody's gonna be there
We got people comin' from everywhere

We got Ling Ting Tong from China
Long Tall Sally from Carolina
We got 007, the private eye
And he's bringin' all the guys from "I Spy"

Come one, come all, we gonna have a ball
Down at the function at the junction
And baby you'd better come on right now

We serving egg foo yung and barbecue
Having chicken dumplings and kidney stew
Having heap big fun till the break of dawn
Gonna shake a tailfeather shoot him 'fore he run

Hold a shotgun on the rooster, and dare him to crow
How could anybody sleep when they could get out on the floor

Tell him, tell them, tell one and tell `em all
Tell `em `bout the function at the junction
Tell `em that they'd better come on right now
Tell `em `bout the function at the junction
Tell `em that they'd better come on right now

Oh the soul brothers, Jitterbugs
Hip cats and fancy hats and
Pretty girls with pretty smiles
All decked out in the latest styles
And Farmer Jim and Guitar Slim and
Betty Boop and ooo-boop-e-doop
And Mohair Sam from Alabam
And Minnesota Fats from Hobo Flats
Breath-takin' Hip-shakin' give it now
Talkin' bout some fascinatin' demonstratin'

They all be gathering here, from far and near
For the Function at the Junction
Brother, you'd better come on right now
Tell `em `bout the function at the junction
Sister, you'd better come on right now
Talkin' `bout a function at the junction
Everybody you'd better come on right now
