Listen, listen to my heartbeat
Listen, listen to my heartbeat
Baby, listen

I don't wanna lose you
As a matter of fact
I can't stand to lose you

When I say I love you, yeah
This time, you can believe me
Yes, you can

I can't blame you if you
Wanna leave me, no, no
After all, I'm the one
Who deceived you

But I'm just here
To let you know
Never, ever, will I
Want to let you go

I don't wanna lose you
Oh, help me say it, somebody
I don't wanna lose you (baby)
Let me, let me, let me say it

You saw me running
Around with another
But the next time
They'll never, no, never
Log on to kill this message

Cause the love in
My heart is so true
No one else will ever do
If you say we're gonna part
Don't you know you're
Gonna break J.T.'s heart

I don't wanna lose you
Oh, the sweet loving you give me
I don't wanna lose you (baby)

Don't let the memory
That we shared fade away
Reconsider my new love and devotion
Cause I can honestly say

My love is real
I'm gonna make you feel it
My love is real, baby
I want you to have it

If I lose your love
It'll be like taking the
Sun out of the sky, baby

If I lose, if I lose, if I lose
If I lose, if I lose
If I lose your love, honey
Where can a man go from here
Oh, no, I don't wanna
Go on without you

I can't live
Listen to my heartbeat
It's eating kind of slow
You just broke my
Heart when you told me
John, I don't love you no more

Tell me one more time
Take me in your arm
Tell me anything can be alright
Tell me that you love me, tell

Hold on to my
Oh, hold on, hold on, baby

I don't wanna lose you
You got to hold it, hold it...
I don't wanna lose you (baby)...
