[Verse 1]
Honey you do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't do without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love go through pain

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
Peculiar as can be

[Verse 2]
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me
I've been so much in love with you baby 'till I don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you makes all
Your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make my love stronger  (stronger, stronger, stronger)

[Chorus]
Ain't that peculiar
A peculiar-ality
Ain't that peculiar baby
A peculiar-arity, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I cried so much just like a child that's lost its toy
Maybe baby you think these tears i cry are tears of joy
A child can cry so much until you do everything they say
But unlike a child my tears don't help me to get my way
I know love can last through years
But how can love last through tears (tears, tears, tears)

Now ain't that peculiar baby?
Peculiar-arity
Ain't it peculiar, honey?
Peculiar as can be

Said I don't understand it baby
It's so strange sometimes
Ain't it peculiar, darling?
