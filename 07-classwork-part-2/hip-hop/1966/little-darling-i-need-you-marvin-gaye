[Verse 1]
It's so hard loving you
But I don't wanna let you go

[Chorus 1]
Little darling I need you (Little darling I need you)
Little darling I love you (Little darling I love you)
Little darling I want you (Little darling I want you)
Little darling I've got to have you (Little darling I've got to have you)

[Verse 2]
And if it means giving up my life
I'm going to give it up (give it up) give it up
There's always one who loves more than the other
But I don't mind, I don't mind

[Chorus 2]
I'm willing to pay the price
Have your love at any sacrifice

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
I know there's two or three in your life
You like as well as me
So if I have to be your #1 fool
Before you care, care about me

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 4]
Ooo hoo, only my finger knows how many tears I've cried, baby
Only my heart knows the awful hurt I feel inside, baby
My life is so lonely, waiting for you to love me only

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
