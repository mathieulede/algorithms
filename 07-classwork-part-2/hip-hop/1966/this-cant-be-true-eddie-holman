(Doo-ooh-woo-ooh)
(Doo-ooh-woo-ooh)
This can't be true, girl
(Doo-ooh-woo-ooh)
Your love for me, girl
(Doo-ooh-woo-ooh)

Just yesterday you saw me walking home
You took my hand and asked me to walk you home
And I felt good inside, sweetheart
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-ooh-ooh)
I felt good inside, sweetheart
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-ooh-ooh)
This can't be true, girl
(Doo-ooh-woo-ooh)
Are you for real, girl
(Doo-ooh-woo-ooh)

Or am I dreaming dreams about you
Or am I dreaming dreams that can't come true
Well I feel good inside, sweetheart
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-ooh-ooh)
Oh-oh-oh

This can't be true, girl
Your love for me, girl

Or am I dreaming dreams about you
Or am I dreaming dreams that can't come true
Well, I feel good inside, sweetheart
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-ooh-ooh)
Oh-oh-oh, I feel good inside, sweetheart
(Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-ooh-ooh)
This can't be true, girl
(This can't be true, girl)
Your love for me, girl
(This can't be true, girl)
This can't...
