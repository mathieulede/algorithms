Money, who needs it?
Just to live my life free and easy
Put the toothbrush in my hand
And let me be travelin', man
'Cause I'm a roadrunner, baby

I'm a roadrunner, baby
Can't stay in one place too long
I'm a roadrunner, baby
Mess with me and I'll be gone

You can love me if you wanna
But I do declare
If I get restless
I've gotta move somewhere
I'm a roadrunner, baby

Can't find my home (no!)
And I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
Roadrunner, baby

Don't a-want no woman
Just have me bound
Got to be free, baby
To roam around

All my life I've been like this
If you love me, it's your own risk
When the dust hit my shoes
I got the urge to move

Said, I'm a roadrunner, baby
Just keep on, keepin' on
Yeah!
And I live the life I love
And I'm gonna love the life I live
Yes, I'm a roadrunner, baby
