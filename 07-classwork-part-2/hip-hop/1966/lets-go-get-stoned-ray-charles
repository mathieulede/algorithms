[Verse]
You know my baby won't let you in
Got a few pennies, a bottle of gin
I'm gonna call your buddy on the telephone
When you work so hard all the day long
And everything you do seems to go wrong
Just drop by my place on my way home
It ain't no harm
To have a little a taste
But don't loose your cool
And start messing up the place
It ain't no harm you're faking just a nip
But don't you fall down bust your lip
Let's go get stoned
Let's go get stoned
