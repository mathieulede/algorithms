Whoa, oh, oh

I'm tired of running around
Me and my baby's gonna settle down
I'm gonna make her my June bride
We're gonna walk down the aisle
Side by side

'Cause I love her
She loves me
That's the way
It's gonna be

And baby
You just wait and see
We gonna be united
(United, united)
We only wanna be
We're gonna be
(United, united)

Whoa, oh, oh
We stick together
Like bees and honey
We'll go together
Like rainy and muddy

She brightens up, oh, my world
She's got everything
I want in a girl

'Cause I need her
She needs me
That's the way
It's gonna be

And baby
You just wait and see
We gonna be united
(United, united)
We got to be
We're gonna be
(United, united)
Oh yeah, yeah

And oh, I'm gonna buy her
A wedding ring
And all the church bells
Gonna ring

And baby
You just wait and see
We gonna be united
(United, united)
We got to be
We're gonna be
(United, united)

And I'm gonna buy her
A wedding ring
And all the church bells
Gonna ring

And baby
You just wait and see
We gonna be united
(United, united)
We got to be
We're gonna be
(United, united)

I want you all alone
We're gonna be
(United, united)
