I just don't know what to do with myself
Don't know just what to do with myself
I'm so used to doing everything with you
Planning everything for two
And now that we're through

I just don't know what to do with my time
I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime
Going to a movie only makes me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
When I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do

Like a summer rose needs the sun and the rain
I need your sweet love to ease all the pain

I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know just what to do with myself
Baby if your new love ever turns you down
Come on back, I will be around
Just waiting for you
I don't what else to do

Like a summer rose needs the sun and the rain
I need your sweet love to ease
I need your sweet love to ease all the pain
