You push me when I'm falling and you kick me when I'm down
I guess I missed my calling I should have been a clown
How much more how much more could I stand
When you're pouring water on a drowning man

Put me on the right track
And then you let me down
You stab me in the back
Everytime I turn around

Won't you try to understand
You're pouring water on a drowning man
You treat me like the fool that I am
You bet that I like everything you do
You put salt in my wounds it's sad but it's true

You warm me with your kisses then you leave me in the cold
How can I know your wishes when I've never been told
Won't you please forgive me just try and understand
You're pouring water on a drowning man

You're pouring water on a drowning man
You treat me like the fool that I am
You bet that I like everything you do
Put salt in my wounds it's sad but it's true

I got tears in my eyes you're pouring water
Oh, I'm a drowning man
I got tears in my eyes
You're pouring water
On a drowning man
You're pouring water
On a poor drowning man
