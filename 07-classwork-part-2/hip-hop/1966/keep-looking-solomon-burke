I was a fool
I told a lie
I did you wrong
I made you cry
So now I'm walking all alone
Down the darkest street in town
Standing in the rain
While my tears keep falling down
I'm soul searching
How could I say goodbye to you?
I'm soul searching
I made you cry
How could I leave
Somebody like you
How could I do all the silly things
That I do
Wht makes me try the way I do
Act a fool the way I do
I need you so bad baby
Won't you come back to me?
I'm soul searching
But nobody like my baby
I keep soul searching
It's driving me crazy
Why
Did I ever say goodbye
I must be outta my mind
I keep walking and looking for a sign
I gotta be crazy baby
To ever let you go
I keep looking for a sign
Oh why
Do I get all the bad breaks
How could I make
Such stupid mistakes
But the truth won't come to me
No matter how I wreck my brain
The rain keeps falling down
And I keep calling out your name
I'm soul searching
