[Verse 1]
Together again
My tears have stopped falling
The long lonely nights
Are now at an end
The key to my heart
You hold in your hand

[Chorus]
And nothing else matters
We're together again
Together again

[Verse 2]
The grey skies are gone
You're back in my arms
Now where you belong
The love that we knew
Is living again

[Chorus][x2]
