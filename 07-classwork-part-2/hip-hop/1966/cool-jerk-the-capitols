Cool jerk, cool jerk, cool jerk, cool jerk
We know a cat who can really do the cool jerk
We know a cat who can really do the cool jerk
Well, this cat they're talking about
I wonder who could it be
'Cause I know I'm the heaviest cat
The heaviest cat you ever did see

When you see me walking down the street
(Hey hey hey)
When the fellas want to speak
(Hey hey hey)
All the business they wish to whisper it
But they know I'm the King of the Cool Jerk
Cool jerk, cool jerk, cool jerk
Ah ha ha

Spoken:
Haha
(Cool jerk, ah ha ha)
Look at them guys looking at me like I'm a fool
(Cool jerk, ah ha ha)
Ah but deep down inside they know I'm cool
(Cool jerk, ah ha ha)
I said now, I said now the moment of truth has finally come
(Cool jerk, ah ha ha)
When I'm gonna show you some, some of that cool jerk
(Cool jerk, ah ha ha)
Now give me a little bit of the drums by himself here
Now give me a little bit of bass with those eighty-eights
Ah you're cookin baby, mmmmmm you're smokin
Now everybody, I wanna hear you all ah

Can you do it, can you do it
Can you do it, can you do it
Can you do it, can you do it
Can you do it, can you do it
Can you do the cool jerk, (come on people) cool jerk (eh hey)
When you see me walkin down the street
Think twice and then the next beat
On the chance that they don't make it work
Cause they know I'm the King of the Cool Jerk
Cool jerk, cool jerk

Come on people (cool jerk), can you do it now (cool jerk)
Come on people
Can you do it, can you do it
Can you do it, can you do it
Can you do it, can you do it
Can you do it, can you do it
Can you do the cool jerk, (come on people) cool jerk
Come on people
(Cool jerk)
Can you do it, now
(Cool jerk)
Come on people
(Cool jerk)
Can you do it, now
(Cool jerk)
