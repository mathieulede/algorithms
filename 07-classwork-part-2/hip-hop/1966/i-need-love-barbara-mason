I need love
I wanna be kissed
I need love
I wanna be hugged
Oh, baby
My mother told me
It's not a thing
For a girl to think of
But I, but I need love
I want to be loved, baby
I want you to hold me so tight
Hold my hand and kiss me goodnight
I need your love, I need love
I'm a girl
But I feel like a woman
(A woman, a woman, a woman)
I want you to act like a man
My soul's on fire and I have
Such a wild desire burning inside
Oh, baby, oh, baby
I need your love, I need love
Oh, hold me tight
Squeeze me all through the night
Make me know you're mine
All of the time
I need love, I need love
I wanna be kissed
I need love, I need love
I wanna be hugged
I'm burning inside
With such a wild desire
Oh, baby, oh baby
I need your love
And I'm burning inside
I need love
I need your love
I'm burning inside
