You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
In the morning, she's my water
In the evening, she's my cup of tea

As long as I live
Wherever trouble lies
I go to her, and like a miracle
Everything just turns out right

You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
She brings her lovin' home now
Just the way it's supposed to be

What she want, she can get
Tender loving
Well she's ready
Yeah she's ready
Yeah she's ready and willing

As long as I live
Wherever trouble lies
I go to her, and like a miracle
Everything just gets alright

You don't know like I know
What that woman has done for me
In the morning, she's my water
In the evening, she's my cup of tea

Nobody knows
Nobody knows
Nobody knows like I know

You don't know
You don't know
You don't know
Nobody knows
