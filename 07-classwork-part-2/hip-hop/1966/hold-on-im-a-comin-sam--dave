Don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'

I'm goin' my way, your lover
If you get cold I will be your cover
Don't have to worry 'cause I'm here
No need to suffer baby, 'cause I'm here

'Cause hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'

Reach out to me for satisfaction
Call my name now for quick reaction

Now don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when the times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

Just hold on, I'm comin'
Hold on, I'm comin'
