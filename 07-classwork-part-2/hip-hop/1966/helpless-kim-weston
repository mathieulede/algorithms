Every day I walk some lonely street
Searching for you 'till you come back to me
People around stop and stare
As if they know the hurt I bear
Suddenly I realize I'm crying, crying, crying

'Cause I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in confusion
And my heart feels much abusion
Since you've been gone
Keeps me crying, crying, crying

In the shelter of your love my strength I found
But now I'm useless baby, since you're not around
I'm helpless baby

Ooh, wee, baby, baby
I'm helpless since I lost your love
Helpless 'cause now I need your love
I never needed no one before
But now I need you more and more
Since you've been gone
Keeps me crying, crying, crying

'Cause I'm helpless 'til you come back to me
Helpless in this world I grieve
I need your words of comfort and
I need those happy times we spent
I'm in a hopeless state of confusion
And your love is the only solution

'Cause I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in confusion
'Till I'm having strange illusions
Loneliness deep inside
Keeps me crying, crying, crying

'Cause I'm in a helpless situation
And I need some consolation
'Cause my mind is in confusion
'Till I'm having strange illusions
Loneliness deep inside
Keeps me crying, crying, crying
