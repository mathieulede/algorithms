Said I wasn't gonna tell nobody else
But I just can't keep it all to myself now
For as long as I've been running around
I finally met a little girl that really got me down now

Baby, you've got my mind messed up
Little girl, little girl you sure got my mind messed up now

I go to bed alone and I can't sleep
Sit down at the table ooh, Lord, I can't eat

Somebody, please, please
Help me now, oh, oh, oh

Sugar plum dancing on in my mind
Every day you're with me seem like Valentine's now
I walked a rainbow, Lord and I chained the moon
Walk around the world and get back before noon

Baby, you've got my mind messed up
Darling, sure got my mind messed up now

Eyes wide open, Lord
And I can't see anywhere the woman go
She can lead for me

Somebody just gotta
Just gotta help me
Oh, oh wee, oh, now

Baby, you've got my mind messed up now
Sure got my mind messed up now

You my love with all of my heart
I'll do anything you want me to do
For you I'd climb the highest mountain
Baby, for you I'd swim the deepest sea

Everywhere you go
You can lead for me

I, I love you
Oh, I love you
I, I love you, baby
