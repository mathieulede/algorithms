Get out my life, woman; you don't love me no more
Get out my life, woman; you don't love me no more
Get out my life, woman; you don't love me no more

Get out my eyes, teardrops; I gotta see my way around
Get out my eyes, teardrops; I gotta see my way around
Get out my life, heartache; nothin' but heartache by the pound

Get off the ladder, woman; I've got to climb up to the top
Get off the ladder, woman; I've got to climb up to the top
Get off the ladder, woman; there is nothin' gonna make me stop

Get out my way, woman; I gotta be movin' on
Get out the way, woman; I gotta be movin' on
Get out the way, woman; I gotta be movin' on

Get out my life, woman; you don't love me no more
Get out my life, woman; you don't love me no more
Get out my life, woman; you don't love me no more
