Baby, can you understand I’m a young nigga living
Coming from the trap, all a nigga know is get it

Big bank rolls in my pockets, all fifties
Turned a little check, then, I showed you I could triple it
Baby, it’s Zoovier, only want you

She don’t give a fuck who stares, looking too good
Get you fucked on sight

I’m tryna spend it all who I got it with, ay
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando,  ay
We be counting up, watch how far them bands go,  ay
Hop out my beamer, she jump out the Lambo, ay
Roll them bands up, smooth how the wind go, ay
Dumping wood guts all out the window, ay
Married to the money, I ain’t never let go, ay
