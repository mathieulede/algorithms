Okay ladies
Now let's get in formation
Okay ladies
Now let's get in formation
Ah

Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess
Paparazzi
Catch my fly and my cocky fresh
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces
My daddy Alabama
Momma Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole
Make a Texas bama

I like my baby hair with baby hair and afros
I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils
Earned all this money but they never take the country out me
I got hot sauce in my bag
Swag

I see it
I want it
I stunt
Yellow bone it
I dream it
I work hard
I grind till I own it
I twirl on them haters
Albino alligators
El Camino
With the seat low
Sipping cocoa with no chaser

Sometimes I go off
Go off
I go hard
Go hard
Get what's mine
What's mine
I'm a star
I'm a star

Cos I slay
Slay
