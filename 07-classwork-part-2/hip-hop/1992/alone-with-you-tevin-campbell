Intro:
Aaah
Ooh yeah
I just want to be alone with you
My name is Tevin
Ooooh
Wish me luck
Oh yeah oh yeah
Ooh yeah

Verse 1:
We were holding hands
In the park
We had to hurry home before it's dark
I can't wait to see your smile again
And I love the time we spend
I waited for the break of day to come
So I can see your smile in the sun
I guess I couldn't wait to get to school
Oooh baby
To see your pretty face
I've got to stay cool
Break it down

Hook:
Girl don't leave me, don't leave me
Oohh baby, the natural way you receive me
Don't take this as an aggression
Girl I learned my lesson
Don't leave me, ooohhh
The natural way you receive me

Don't take this as an aggression
That's why

Chorus:
I just want to be alone with you
And there's nothing else
I'd rather do
Just to get the chance I had again
Just us two, til the end
Oooh baby


Verse 2
Now just the other night
On the phone
I tried to impress you with my tone
I've got to be for real
If you're my friend
Or you'll never call me back again

Hook
Girl don't leave me, don't leave me
Oohh baby, the natural way you receive me
Don't take this as an aggression
Girl I learned my lesson
Don't leave me, ooohhh
The natural way you receive me

Don't take this as an aggression


Girl don't leave me, don't leave me
Oohh baby, the natural way you receive me
Don't take this as an aggression
Girl I learned my lesson
Don't leave me, ooohhh
The natural way you receive me

Don't take this as an aggression
Ooooh ooooh oooh yeah

I've got to stay cool
Break it down

Chorus
I just want to be alone with you
Oooooh
I just want to be alone with you
And there's nothing else
I'd rather do
Just to get the chance I had again
You know you know
Just us two, til the end

Girl don't leave me, don't leave me
Dont leave me baby
Girl don't leave me, don't leave me
You know ill be here for you
Girl don't leave me, don't leave me
Girl don't leave me, don't leave me
Girl don't leave me, don't leave me
Just me and you

I just want to be alone with you
And there's nothing else
I'd rather do
Just to get the chance I had again
You know you know
Just us two, til the end
