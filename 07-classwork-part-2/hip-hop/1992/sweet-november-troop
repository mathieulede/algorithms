Intro: baby,what's wrong with us
I feel a storm comin'

Verse I

When autumn first arrived
You were my lady..
And love was written in the winter snow...
And with the change of months, there came October
And now i wonder
Where our love
Did go..

It was the second rain of autumn...
We shared our feelings
And it was such, such a glorious autumn dream
Yes it was..
But. like kids were too shy to say to each other
That together, we would always like
To be...

Hook:
Someday soon
I know we'll come together
Even though our feelings change as seasons do. (yeah babe)
But, maybe sweet November will tell us the story
That will bring us back the love...
That we both knew..

Verse II

When autumn first arrived, you said you'd be my lady
And you promised me that you would
Never go , ooh ,hoo
But, with the change of months..their came October
And now I'm wondering Where, where did our love go..

It was the second rain of autumn (second rain of autumn)
We shared our feelings..
And it was such...
Such a glorious autumn dream, yes it was
But like kids were too shy , to say to one another
That together we would always like
To be....

(Repeat Hook)
