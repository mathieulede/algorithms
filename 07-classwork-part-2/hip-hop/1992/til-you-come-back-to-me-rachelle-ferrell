I can only blame myself
To think that someone else could ever take your place
I must have been out of my head to turn away
I said I needed time and space
I thought the grass was greener on the other side
You never miss your water ‘til your well runs dry

Chorus

I wrote you letters, you sent them back
I'm gonna keep on trying, in my heart I still believe
I'll take my chances, ‘cause I can wait
I promise that's what I'll do…'til you come back to me

Tried to convince myself
The love we shared was over and a thing of the past
We'd grown apart and lost the feeling that we once shared
Just didn't realize
How much I hurt you when I chose to say goodbye
I had it all but I just wasn't satisfied

Repeat Chorus

Bridge

‘Cause there's no one in this world
Who's gonna love you like I do
I'll keep on wishing ‘til you come back
I won't give up ‘til you're right here with me

Repeat Chorus
