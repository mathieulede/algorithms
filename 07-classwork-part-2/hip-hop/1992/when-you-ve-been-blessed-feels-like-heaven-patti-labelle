In a world of superheros, in a world of weak and
Strong;
In a sea of have and have nots, I've survived the
Raging storm
And I pray for a world where we all can be free
It's a heavenly vision, It's a garden that I see
It's a joy that graced the heart of lovin me
When you've been blessed...feels like heaven
When you've been blessed...feels like heaven
I have faith, I have hope. And I trust in the day
When the music from heaven will show us the way
It's a garden of music, it's a garden of love
And we are all HIS children sharing gifts from
Above
When you've been blessed....feels like heaven, feels
Like heaven
When you've been blessed...pass it on, pass it on
