[Intro]
Here they come yo, here they come [x2]
This or that [x4]

[Verse 1]
Who's the Black Sheep, what's the Black Sheep?
Know not who I am, or when I'm coming, so you sleep
Wasn't in my room, wasn't in my sphere
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S, yes I get suckers start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here one apart
Back, Middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? [Hey!]
Now get a yo! [Yo!]
You gotta hay? [Huh!]
It's for the hoes [Oh!]
The styling is creative, Black Sheep of the Native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the Quest
Deaf retarded uncles, in parties were they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam NOW
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours

YO!
Who's the Black Sheep...

You can get with this, \ three
Or you can get with that. / times
I think you'll get with this
Cuz this is where it's at

You can get with this, \ three
Or you can get with that. / times
I think you'll get with this
Cause this is kinda fat
Where's the Black Sheep, here's the Black Sheep
Even if we wanted to the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that
Because in fact, on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Ya know what I'm saying, yo Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this, or go with that with no delaying
See, in actuality, one be can it be
I made it look easy, because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled, try to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat, and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls, and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat

You can get with this, \ three
Or you can get with that. / times
I think you'll get with this
Cuz this is where it's at

Engine, Engine, Number Nine
On the New York transit line
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!
Back on the scene
Crispy and clean
You can try
But then why
Cause you can't intervene
We be the outcast
Down for the settle
Won't play the rock
Won't play the pebble
Open the door
You best believe
We're sliding through it swiftly
Niftly
We can make it hip to be
What we are cause what we be
Be the epitome
Doo-Dah-Dipity
So now I dwell
Just to say your plainar
Hold your cup cause I got the container
Pass a plader
Cross the fader
Black Sheep get played
Like the Sony innovator
Never the traitor
Party of later
And you can get a scoop
Later

You can get with this, \ three
Or you can get with that. / times
I think you'll get with this
Cuz this is where it's at
