[Verse 1:]
Where do we go
When there's a need to be loved
Like you need to be loved
Oh, I'll let you know
Just what to do and where to go

[Chorus:]
Hey, welcome to the comfort zone
When you need to be loved
Like you need to be loved
Welcome to the comfort zone
Do whatever feels right and turns you on

[Verse 2:]
After a hard day's work
There's one thing to be certain of
This ol' familiar love
It's not unusual to find that it's sensual
It's all you need to let go

There's no need to try
Or compromise
Or settle for another outside of my love
The thing to do
When you get through
Heed the message seek the comfort of my zone

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Hey, let me make you comfortable
Let me take control
And give your mind a break
From the day you made

Let's turn the lights down low
And oh, the rest you know
I'll be here for you
'Cause you just stepped into the comfort zone
