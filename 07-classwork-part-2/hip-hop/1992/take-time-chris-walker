Im the best with the pen
They tryin to set me up like a special event
See me on fight night
Mess me with me then
Get knocked the fuck out
Like i said im the best
All the rest could pretend x2


I be the best till im dead and forever after
The precious craft I specialize in one you've yet to master
Some pathetic rappers - think they nicer than chris?
But when the mics in my grip
Budlights when bud lights at the crib and im nice and im crisp
In nicer than trips all expense paid
Your inept boring and played normal and weak
Tryin to be fancy like formals to me
Or a morman's beliefs that underwear is more than just breifs
Yall wanna sleep like the morning yawnin before the shower
Im killen kids like the morning after
Plan B - im the one u can't beat - kidnap ya family like cambys
Just so u pansys can't sleep
Ill do this damn things
Till they pay me a grand each second to stampede
They listen to every second of my record the executives can't leave
You waste my damn time
From now on you can't rhyme ever
Im the man like mega - u could take my girl right now
But u could never smash mine better


Im the best with the pen
They tryin to set me up like a special event
See me on fight night
Mess me with me then
Get knocked the fuck out
Like i said im the best all the rest could pretend x2

You dont wanna play me at this game
Dragon spit flame change ya frame into embers
Its pain you'll remember
Only time u drop jewels when your remains are dismembered
My brain can remember the day I changed it forever
U santiago on the way to desert
To become the winds of change to impress a strangers for treasure
That doesnt even exist -
These teachings I give speaking are the only reason I Live
U searching for whats inside like the deez in ya crib
I keep it classic like the bees on disc
He's confident - you too incompetent to comprehend
The consequence of the confrontation its common sense
A concentrated combination of fists contact ya head
Cause considerable complications lose consciousness
Fall straight back to sleep BACK TO BED
Actors like ronald Reagan - get put on a stage n just DO NOT compete


Im the best with the pen
They tryin to set me up like a special event
See me on fight night
Mess me with me then
Get knocked the fuck out
Like i said im the best all the rest could pretend x2
