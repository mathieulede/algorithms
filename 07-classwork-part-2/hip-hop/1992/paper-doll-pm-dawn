Imagine yourself as a link on a chain, the chain is wrapped around
Someone's mind
If you break off, then things start to change. And then You realize that there's no time
No direction as you fly through the wind; you stop to ponder on a pink
Chateau
The theme from "Mahogany" still transcends, but Quote Unquote, that's the way it goes

I'm looking at the picture again. I'm looking at the picture again
I spin the sun dial to expectation; twenty years ago I saw you yesterday
You're looking at the picture now, I see you looking at the picture now
And for the slightest moment I watched you think about what it's like as a
Paper doll

Chorus:
One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, (paper doll)
Paper doll
One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, (paper doll)
Oh, paper doll

Imagine yourself as a cloud in the skyâ€“ you pass me by and I blow you a kiss
A thinking cloud, so you're wondering why, only to find out it doesn't exist
Life surrounds what's presumed as wise; it wouldn't be wise until the fist
Uncurls
No one I don't know ever stares in my eyes. Because of the quote unquote real world

And mow I'm thinking about yesterday. I'm actually thinking about yesterday
A thousand words say it doesn't make sense. A thousand ideas tell me otherwise
You're thinking about yesterday. And now you're thinking about yesterday, but for the slightest moment I watched you think about what it's like as a paper doll

Chorus

Regardless of how you think, regardless of how you feel, see yourself as
More than a human being. It's recognizable, spiritually and mentally
Hold my hands forever, paper doll

Chorus
