[Verse 1:]
I send to you, my silent prayer
Before I sleep at night
I send to you, my silent prayer
Baby, so you'll be all right

Every moment I think of you
I just can't shake up my dreams, oh no
I read the paper and watch the news
I don't know what it means

[Pre-Chorus:]
When you do what you got to do
You must know that
I'm there with you

Every breath that I take
I hope and I pray, sweet baby
Baby, we're okay
Silent prayer

[Chorus:]
Silent prayer (Silent prayer)
Silent prayer (Silent prayer)
Silent prayer (I send to you my silent prayer)

[Verse 2:]
I hold a picture of a golden sunset
(Yeah)
And I'll take your hand
(Take my hand)

We're gonna walk down that promise road
Just like we planned
(Just like we planned)

[Pre-Chorus:]
Cause I know what I'm gonna do
Just as soon
As I'm back with you

Every breath that I take
I hope and I pray, sweet baby
Baby, we're okay
Silent prayer

[Repeat Chorus:]

I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent prayer
I send to you my silent
(Baby) prayer (every hour)
My silent prayer

[Repeat Chorus:]
