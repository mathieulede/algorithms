I miss you, it's been so long
Since I had you wake up next to me
I miss you, I'm coming home
There's no place that I would rather be

I wake up every morning
And reach to pull you close to me
There's nothing but the pillow
And not your sexy body

So I called you up
Just to hear your voice
I can't wait 'till get home to you
Then we'll spend some time alone

I miss you, it's been so long
Since I had you wake up next to me
I miss you, I'm coming home
There's no place that I would rather be

Sometimes it gets so crazy
Living life from town to town
And all of my days are kind of lonely
How I wish you were around

I wanna feel your touch
It's what I need so much
I want to make sweet love to you all night
And I'll hold your body tight

I miss you, it's been so long
Since I had you wake up next to me
I miss you, I'm coming home
There's no place that I would rather be

As I sit and watch the raindrops fall
I keep thinking of all the love we share
I can't wait until that moment comes
When it's you and me in each other's arms

I miss you, it's been so long
Since I had you wake up next to me
I miss you, I'm coming home
There's no place that I would rather be
