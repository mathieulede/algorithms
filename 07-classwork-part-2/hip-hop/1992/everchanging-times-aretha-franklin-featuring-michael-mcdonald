[Verse 1]
It's an ever changing time
I see, that clock upon the wall
Well it don't bother me at all
It's an ever changing time
And me, ever changing time
Everything is going so much faster
It seems like I'm
Watching my life, and everything I do
Wonder if the dreams that I believed in
Still come true

[Chorus 1]
Caught in between, it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I got to find me a better understanding
Everything keeps forgetting what's mine
I got to find me a way, less-demanding
And we're holding on so tight, together all of our lives

[Verse 2]
And I, I had some big idea
So much of my life, still not completed, hopes and fears
Watching it change, into something new
Wondering it I'm going to find the answer, loving you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] [x2]
I see, that clock upon the wall, well it don't bother me at all
It's an ever changing time

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] [x7]
