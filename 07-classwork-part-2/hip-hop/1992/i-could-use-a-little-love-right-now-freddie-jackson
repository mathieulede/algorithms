Five minutes to midnight and the mood is right
A lot of wine, a 'lil music, slow dancing by candlelight
Can't you feel it inside you there's something going on
It's too strong to be questioned and it feels too good to be wrong
Whenever we touch like this
Whenever I kiss you lips
Baby my heart beats faster by the minute
Whenever I touch your face, you know I want you right here
I want you right now cause there's so much pleasure in your embrace

Darlin' I, I could use a 'lil love right now
Darlin' I, I could use a 'lil love right now

Baby let's take a shower and let the water run
We could stay in there for hours, cause you know that it could be fun
Just put your head on my pillow cause I wanna rub your back
Ooh the way you get emotional girl I know you like it like that

Darlin' I, I could use a 'lil love right now
Darlin' I, I could use a 'lil love right now

Do it in the bath do it in the tub
Do it in the living room on the rug
Do it in the kitchen do it in the sink
Do it whichever way you think
Darlin I, I could use a 'lil love right now
I'll be tender baby, I swear I'll do all I can
All I can to satisfy you
You're complete surrender is all I got
So let's take it to the limit, play by the rules
Go for broke, do whatever we choose
