[Verse 1:]
There are times when I feel good
Now, babe
There are times when I know I should
Oh, darling
There are ones that I wanna do
But ain't nobody like you
Nobody

I've been watching you
For so long now, babe
In my heart
I'm feeling so strong for you, babe
And I hope you feel it too
Cause ain't nobody like you
And you know it, babe

[Chorus:]
I've been up
And I've been down
I've had my feet swept off the ground
By somebody who just picked me up
And threw me away
(Yeah)

I've been rich
And I've been poor
I've had boys in
And out my door
But I know
You're the only
You're the only one for me

[Verse 2:]
There'll be times
When you wanna go
Now, baby
There'll be times
When I wanna keep moving on

But not this time
Gonna see it through
Cause ain't nobody like you
You know it, babe
You know it
You know it

I been around the world a few times
(Oh, babe)
I have searched
But I could not find my darling
Always in the field of view
Cause there's nobody like you
And you know it, baby
(Ooh)

[Chorus:]
I've been up
And I've been down
I've had my feet swept off the ground
By somebody who just picked me up
And threw me away
Oh, yes
Yes, they did now

I've been rich
And I've been poor
I've had boys in
And out my door
But I know you're the only
Really
The only one for me

So good to me
Ain't nobody like you
You know it, babe

Sometimes I need your loving
Sometimes I need your care
So come put your arms around me
To show me that you'll be there

I said
All that I'm trying to tell you is, baby
Ain't nobody like you
And you know it, babe

I said
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody like you

Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody like you
Nobody, nobody

Ain't nobody like you, baby
Like you babe
Nobody
You know it, babe
Love you, babe

I've been up
And I've been down
I've had my feet swept off the ground
By somebody who just picked me up
And threw me away
(Ooh)

Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody like you
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
Nobody can love me like you do

Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
You know that you're good to me
Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody like you

Ain't nobody
Ain't nobody
You know that you're better than me
Ain't nobody like you
