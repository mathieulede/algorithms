See I wanna give you everything
I wanna love you show no shame
I want you to know I belong to you
See champagne and candle lights
Breakfast in bed would be alright
Baby there's nothing that I wouldn't do for you

I got a lot of love to give
And I wanna give it to you
All I wanna know is can you handle it Baby
Girl I swear I treat you right
Morning, afternoon and into the night
All I wanna know is can you handle it Baby

I know a lot of guys call on you
But they could never love you the way that I do
Would you give me the chance

When you're serious just call me
We'll make love constantly
Are you ready for a true romance

Repeat 1

If you want something real
I swear I know you're gonna like
The way I make you feel
I'll give you good love and I'll never quit
All I wanna know is can you hanlde it Baby

Repeat 1

(Ad lib)
