Some predicted we will not last
'Cause our personalities, all been clashing
I would rather be left alone
Let us work it out on our own

And baby, don't turn like we fought
Then we broke and say that it was our fault
And can we go our separate ways
Content at the decisions we made, lady

Sometimes a person appose the love that they chose
Who felt to keep love new
There's upon a need that wants to be free
There's a part that we'll always believe, yeah

When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
You can never let nobody ever come between that
When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
Gonna cry together, nothing's better than when you love somebody

Maybe we got involved too fast
In a day we making love was too much to axe
There has to be more than sexual love
So you and I have to try to talk and take it slow

Now do we have a common dream
Something we can show that can prove we're a team
People, wanna prove them wrong
But now the wrong has marched home, hey, hey

So, girl, we got to let go, I love you, I know
We managed tonight to be brave enough
To weather the storm as others we've known have chose to do
They're not changing my point of view, no

When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
You can never let nobody ever come between that
When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
Gonna cry together, nothing's better than when you love somebody

When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
When somebody loves you back, baby
When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
I wanna love you back, wanna love you back

Sometimes a person appose the lover they chose
Who felt to keep love new
And there's a part of me that wants to be free
And there's a part that will always believe, yeah

When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
You can't let nobody ever come between that
When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
Gonna cry together, nothing's better than when you love somebody

When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
Wanna love somebody
When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
Somebody loves you, somebody love you
Somebody loves you

When you love somebody, somebody loves you back
Somebody's special
