When you get right down to it
Isn't this moment what it's all about, girl?

And when you get right down to it
Don't you just feel this moment's last everything?

Holding you and touching you
Girl, I need a whole lifetime
To do all the things
That I wanna do for you

When you get right down to it
Doesn't this moment wash away the bad times?

And when you get right down to it
Doesn't all the hurt you ever felt disappear?

Holding you and touching you
Girl, I know that this magic
Just can't last forever but then

When you get right down to it
Don't you want to relive this moment again?

Yeah, holding you and touching you
Girl, I know that this magic
Just can't last forever but then

When you get right down to it
Don't you want to relive this moment again?

Ooh girl, again and again
All over again, all over again
Just live it again, just live it again

We got to live it again, girl
