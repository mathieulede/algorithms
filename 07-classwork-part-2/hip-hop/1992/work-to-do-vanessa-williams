I can't wait to get home to you
I got so much work to do, work

[Verse 1: Vanessa Williams]
I'm taking care of business
Baby, can't you see
I gotta make it for you
Ad I gotta make it for me

Sometimes it may seem
Boy, I'm neglecting you
But I'd love to spend more time
But I got so much to do

[Chorus]
Ooh, I got work to do
I got work, baby
I got work to do
I got a job, yeah
I got work to do
Said I got work to do

[Verse 2]
Oh I'm out here trying to make it
Baby, can't you see
It takes a lot of money to make it
Let's talk truthfully

So keep your love light burning
Oh, you gotta have a little faith
You might as well get used to me
Coming home a little late, oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, I got work to do
I got work, baby
I got work to do
I got a job, yeah
I got work to do
Said I got work to do

Ooh, I got work to do
I got work, baby
I got work to do
I got a job, yeah
I got work to do
Said I got work to do

[Rap: Black Sheep]
And a one, and a two
And a listen
I got a V-a-n-e-double s-a
She's out to give a scene
We used to eat together
Now it's candlelight TV
But woman, work it out, 'till the job's done
Cause it's not the one to flip on his dip, double or one
So I come to your buns like a frankfurter
Accepted in more circles than a shot putter
I support ya, I'll surely sport ya
'Till you cross another fader
You're off to work I can dig it, later

[Chorus]
Ooh, I, I got work to do
I got work, baby
I got a job, sugar
I got work to do
Everybody's got work to do

[Hook]
I can't wait to get home to you
I got so much work to do
Work, work
Work, work

I can't wait to get home to you
I got so much work to do
Work, work
Work, work
[Repeat x2]
