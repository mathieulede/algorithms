[Verse 1:]
It's hard to realize we've said our last goodbyes
Where could the dream have gone to
Now I know there's no way
That I can make you stay
No matter how I want to

We made some memories that
My heart will always treasure
Before you close the door
Let's make one more

[Chorus:]
Baby, just for tonight
Let me give myself to you
And all I ask is just for tonight
Love me like you used to do

And I promise that I won't cry
I won't ask you why
I won't even try to change your feelings
If you just hold me tight
Just once more, just for tonight

[Verse 2:]
I thought the love we found
Was built on solid ground
And it would just grow stronger yeah

Crazy as it may seem
I need to dream the dream
For just, just a little longer

So for the sake of all that magic
We made together
Open your heart to mine
Just one more time

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
All I want is one more night, yeah
So why don't you come to me let me dream?
This night means everything to me
All I ask is for tonight

Baby, just hold me tight
Yeah
Come to me, let me dream
This night means everything to me
