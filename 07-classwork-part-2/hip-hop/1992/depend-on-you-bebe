I never thought that I could ever need someone ( The way that I have come to need You)
Never dreamed I'd love someone ( The way I've fallen in love with You.) Fallen in Love
You're the reason why I live and tht's not all. There's plenty other reasons
But most of all, I'm
Grateful!
I can depend on,(And You know You'll be there)
I can depend on You
I can depend, casue You will be there. I can depend on You

He means the world to me. And soon you will agree
The love I've found was worth waiting for

In viting you to come with me
Only on a ride your heart can afford
'Cause I fell in love and that's not all
I'll be in love, love forever
Bt most of all I'm...
Grateful I can depend
I can depend ( Depend on You)
I can depend...
