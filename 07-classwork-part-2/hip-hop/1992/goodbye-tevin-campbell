[Verse 1:]
Say, lady
Can I ask you why
You're treating me like a step child?
With a future not so bright
I thought you said
You would never be that way to me
You said you'd never leave me
For the rest of my life

I believe you all the times you said, baby
You're always on my mind
I don't believe you
So save those words you said to me
And I'll be on my way
I've got to say
Goodbye, baby

[Hook:]
You didn't want my love
That's what starts the pain, baby
You didn't need my love
I think that's your game

[Chorus:]
Goodbye, goodbye
You'd never be that way to me
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I've got a love
That you will never see
Hey

[Verse 2:]
I guess you thought you had me
Strung out on your love
Simply because you're oh, so fine

It takes more than looks
To steal my heart away from me
So I'm sorry, baby
The joke's on you this time

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I'm on a rampage
This is my stage
'Cause I'm the T to the E to the V to the I to the N
That's where it starts
Here we go

[Repeat Chorus:]

Goodbye
Goodbye
