[Verse 1]
Here, here I am again
And I'm staring at these same four walls
Alone again
And now, all the colors blend
And I'm growing numb and I've become
This empty page

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, its tragic
Stumbling through all this static

[Chorus]
I just want to talk to you
And my broken heart just has no use
And I, I guess promises are better
Left unsaid, yeah
Every time you try to tell me
You say the words that I'm the only
But I'm the one who's crawling on the ground
When you say love makes the world go around

[Verse 2]
My love, look at what you've done to me
For someone who has felt so strong
It's amazing I'm completely gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, its tragic
Stumbling through all this static

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If that's the kind of love you give me
I'd rather be alone, believe me
It's not the way you apposed to treat me
I'd rather walk away

[Chorus]
I just want to talk to you
And my broken heart just has no use
And I, I guess promises are better
Left unsaid, yeah
Every time you try to tell me
You say the words that I'm the only
But I'm the one who's crawling on the ground
When you say love makes the world go around, yeah
You say love makes the world go around
Every time you try to tell me
I don't care you're not the only
Don't you know I'm coming back around
Because I say love makes the world go around, yeah
Because I say love makes the world go around
