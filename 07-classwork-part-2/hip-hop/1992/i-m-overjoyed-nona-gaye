Thinking of you
Brings a smile to my face
Any time, any place I am
And it's the truth
How you take control of emotions
I never knew I had

I'm overjoyed
Of how you're making me feel
I'm overjoyed
Because this time it's real
I'm overjoyed
You see, this I can't ignore
Because I'm overjoyed over you

Over you
I'm overjoyed over you
Over you
Each day with you
Is an adventure into paradise, you see
I found something new
Each time I look into your eyes, baby

(I'm overjoyed)
Over you, baby
(I'm overjoyed)
I'm overjoyed
(I'm overjoyed, you see)
This I can't ignore
Because I'm overjoyed over you

And I'll never go away
I'll be here to stay
I'll be right here by your side
I'll never let you down
May our love never die

Cause I'm overjoyed
How you make me feel
Because this time it's real
This I can't ignore, baby

(I'm overjoyed)
I'm overjoyed, baby
(I'm overjoyed)
I'm overjoyed, baby
(I'm overjoyed)
I'm overjoyed
(This I can't ignore
Because I'm overjoyed over you)

You know I love the way
That you make me feel inside
And you'll always be the only one
This I can't ignore
Because I'm overjoyed over you

I'm overjoyed
Of how you're making me feel
I'm overjoyed
Because this time it's real
I'm overjoyed
You see, this I can't ignore
Because I'm overjoyed over you

I'm overjoyed about it
Gonna tell the world about it
Hey, even scream and shout it
I'm overjoyed, baby...
