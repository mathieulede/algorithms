[Spoken Intro: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
There is something
I have to say to you
If you promise you'll
Understand
I cannot contain myself
When in your presence
I'm so humble
Touch me
Don't hide our love
Woman to man

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
She's just a lover
Who's doing me by
It's worth the giving
It's worth the try
You cannot cleave it
Or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
It's just a feeling
You have to soothe it
You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it
It's just desire
You cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

[Pre-Chorus: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust, woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move
Set me free

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear
There's something about you baby
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow, to just
Keep it in the closet

[Verse 4: Michael Jackson + Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
If you can get it
It is worth a try
I really want it
I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it
'Cause if it's aching
You have to rub it

[Refrain: Michael Jackson]
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)
(She wants to give it)
(Ahh, she wants to give it)

[Verse 4: Princess Stephanie of Monaco]
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear
There's something about you baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow, to just
Keep it in the closet

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear
There's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
There's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
There's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet
