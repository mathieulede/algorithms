Dad: Hey!
Kid: What?!
Dad: Turn that off!
Kid: Dad, this is the best part!

Kid: No!

Kid takes tape out, puts in new tape

Kid: Yeah, right. Too late. Sure. Eat this[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

[Hook]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Verse 2]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right

[Hook]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Coda]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[L.T.B. Rap Performance]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye

[Hook]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're Black or White

[Outro]
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
