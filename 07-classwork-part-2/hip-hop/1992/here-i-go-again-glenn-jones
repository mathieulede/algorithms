Here I go again
Watch it now 'cause
Here I go again
I've been hurt so much before
I told myself, yes, I did
No more, no more won't get hurt any more
There I was by myself
Doin' all right
Until I saw you last night
And then I knew that
Here I go again
I cannot help it
Here I go again
Making the same mistakes
Heading for more heartaches
What can I do when there's nothing I can do?
I looked in your eyes and I knew that I was blue
What 's the use?
I'll just give in
Try as I may and I do
I'll never win, never win, baby, I'll never win
Now, you're here, so close to me
I can't resist you
And I knew when I kissed you
I'm gonna sing now
Here I go again
Watch it now 'cause
Here I go again
Falling in love, in love
Falling in love, in love
Falling in love, in love
Falling in love
