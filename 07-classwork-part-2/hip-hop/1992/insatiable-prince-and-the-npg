[Verse 1]
Turn the lights off, strike a candle
No one that i've ever, knows how 2 handle my body
The way u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u
I got a jones, martha
Oh yeah, it be like this (i can't have a hug)
I can't have a hug (unless)
Unless i have a kiss

[Chorus 1]
My body, baby, u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u

[Verse 2]
Like a wildcat, martha, in a celibate rage
I want you alone in my dirty little cage
Can u understand, martha?

[Chorus 1]
My body, baby, u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 u

[Verse 3]
2 night we video...
No one will ever know
We'll erase the naughty bits
I'll show my...
If you show your...
I can't help it, martha {'insatiable' repeated in the background}
I can't help what u do 2 me
U are my every fantasy

[Chorus 2]
There's no telling how far i'd go
Cause when it comes 2 u, i know
I'm insatiable and i just can't stop
Even if i wasn't thirsty
I would drink every drop

[Verse 4]
Please, baby, don't say no
'Cause i'll surely go crazy
Ok, so all u do is push the little red button...
And i belong 2 u in your little video box
Hey - don't look at the clock, yeah
It's 2:45, we got all night
First u gotta tell me what u want me to do

[Chorus 1]
My body, baby, u truly do
Insatiable's my name when it comes 2 you

[Chorus 2]
There's no telling how far i'd go
Cause when it comes 2 you, i know
I'm insatiable and i just can't stop
Even if i wasn't thirsty
I would drink every drop

[Verse 5]
So take it slow baby, and let's unwind
Do u really want all my clothes off? (yes)
What are u gonna do to prove it?
Aren't u afraid we're gonna be found out?
Well, let's get on with the shoutin'
Turn the lights down low (turn the lights down lower)
Doesn't my body look good in the shadows?
Baby knows what 2 do
Have you done this before? (i don't know)
You say u want my hips up in the air? (yeah)
I don't know, i don't care

[Outro]
(My body, baby, u truly do)
I knew i could be nasty with u
(Up and down, just like a seesaw) (back and forth)
(Back and forth)
Listen (oh girl, i'm falling)
I love u, baby
I love u baby, you're mine
You're nastier than i thought
It's just 2:49...
