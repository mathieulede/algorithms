I've been around for quite some time
Patiently waiting for you to settle down
But my patience is starting to wear very thin
From stories of your women time and time again

Bridge:
So don't take my love for granted
Or you might lose a good thing
I'm trying to do the best I can for you
And when you stop playing around
You'll really know it's true

Chorus:
That I'm the one you need baby
I'm the one you need baby
If you look inside your heart
You'll really it's true
That I'm the one you need baby

'Cause I care for you
I live for you

I'm not out to get your money
'Cause I buy my own clothes and I pay my own rent
All I want from you is love and affection
That'll keep us moving in the right direction

Repeat Bridge
Repeat Chorus

'Cause I care for you
I live for you
I'd die for you
I'm the one you need baby
Yeah, I'm the one you need
I'm the one
