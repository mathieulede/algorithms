CHORUS
Somebody loves you baby
Somebody loves you baby
Somebody loves you baby
Somebody loves you baby
You know who it is

It happened so suddenly
I woke up one morning with you on my mind
No matter what i did
Couldn't stop thinking about you
Wanted instant replay of yesterday

CHORUS

I'm under your spell
I don't to break free
You can make a slave out of me
I worship you and nobody else
I pledge my love to you forever

CHORUS

I need you right now
Baby don't say no
'Cause you look like you ready to get it on
Whatever you give me
I give it to you back
All the love you'll ever need i'll give it to you

CHORUS
