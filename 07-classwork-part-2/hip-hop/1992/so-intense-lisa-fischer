[Verse 1:]
I always thought I couldn't be caught
'Cause I was a cool and cautious kind
You know, I could take love or leave it
You had to make me believe it
Make me believe it
I always tried to keep it inside
To bite my tongue before I'd say
"You're my one and only"
You had to take the time to show me
Show me
Show me

[Chorus:]
But suddenly love's finally taken my breath away
It's so intense it doesn't make sense
So intense
Out of control love's blinding me
Like a brand-new light of day
It's so intense
So intense

[Verse 2:]
I've always said, and you heard me
Good things take the time
They have to blossom and flower
It takes more than a minute or an hour
More than an hour

[Chorus] (2x)

I'm not the same
And I'm thankful for the change
You see I did not invite it
But I won't fight it
Cause I'm in love with you

[Chorus]
