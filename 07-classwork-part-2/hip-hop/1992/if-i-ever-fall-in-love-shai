[Intro]
Shai
Coming right back at you, baby
Part two
The remix
If I ever fall in love again
Next time, the lady will be just like you

[Verse 1]
The very first time that I saw your brown eyes
Your lips said "Hello" and I said "Hi"
I knew right then you were the one
But I was caught up in physical attraction
But to my satisfaction
Baby, you were more than just a face

[Chorus]
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love so true (so true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
Oh

[Verse 2]
Yeah, baby, yeah
My, my, my, my, my, my
I swear, the next time she'll be my friend
If I say that I could be your one and only
Promise that you'll never leave me lonely
I just wanna be the one you need
Oh, baby
I just wanna be the one to serve you
Sometimes, I feel as if I don't deserve you
I cherish every moment that we share

[Chorus]
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love so true (so true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you

[Bridge 1]
Hey baby
I made a promise
The next time I fell in love
That my love would also be my friend
Somebody who'll be there for me through thick and thin
To love me, to hold me, comfort me
Somebody who would be there with me all through the night
Somebody just like you

[Bridge 2 (2x)]
My friend
The very next time she will be my friend
Someone who I can believe in
My friend
The very next time she will be my friend

[Chorus (repeat until fade)]
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love again (again)
I will be sure that the lady is a friend
And if I ever (ever fall)
In love so true (so true)
I will be sure that the lady's just like you
