[Intro:]
Don't talk
Just listen

First of all
I have to be honest with you, baby
I lied
When i told you
I never wanted to see you again

Can you (can you stay babe, with me)
Just for tonight?
And maybe we can do something
Like make love
Watch the sunrise
Or listen to JoJo, K-Ci
Sing us a verse

Slide, closer baby
Ha, that Devante baby
Oh, you feel so sexy
So good

[Verse 1:]
Sorry I left you, left you crying
Since you've been gone
I've been all alone
Cause all my tears
You know they left me drowning

Please, baby I'm begging for you
To stay at home
Tonight
Let's start our love again
Tonight
Be more than just friends
The sun it is going down
So baby won't you stay for a little while (baby won't...)

[Chorus:]
Baby, won't you just stay?
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
Baby, won't you just stay? (you babe...)
Baby, why don't you just stay?

[Verse 2:]
So here we are
Just me and you
Thinking of the things
That we used to do babe

Tonight is yours, lady
Yours and mine
Let's try again
To put our trust on the line

Tonight
Let's start our love again
Tonight
We can be more than just friends
The sun is going down
So baby won't you stay for a little while
Forget about yesterday, stay...

[Chorus:]
Baby, won't you just stay?
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while

[Bridge:]
Forget about yesterday
Cause I want you so bad
Make love to me
Like you never had
My love is coming down

Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
Baby, won't you just stay?
For a little while
I'm sorry I've done you so wrong, so wrong
And I really need you to come back home
I'm on my bended knee
I'm begging you...
Stay
Come on back, come on back
Come on back yeah...
