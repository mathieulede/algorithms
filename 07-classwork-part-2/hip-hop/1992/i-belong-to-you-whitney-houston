[Intro]
In a world where dreams are few
You've got me baby, I've got you
You're the one that makes me feel brand new

[Bridge]
Sometimes love can wear you out
Chill your soul baby, make you doubt
That's you'll never find the one that's true

[Verse 1]
All my life I've longed for this
Someone who makes me happy
Let's seal this moment with a kiss
I want to know
And nothin's gonna stop me because

[Chorus]
I've been to the bottom
But I'm back on top
And I'm feeling the rhythm
As we start to rock
When ya get down to it
I belong to you

[Bridge]
Though I'm not afraid to let it show
I'll tell the world I want everyone to know
There's nobody who does me like you do

[Verse 2]
All of my love is yours tonight
I live to make you happy
Nothing has ever felt so right
I want it all
And nothin's gonna stop me because

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When you touch me tender
And you reach my soul
When I start to weaken
And I lose control
When you get down to it
I belong to you

[Chorus]
