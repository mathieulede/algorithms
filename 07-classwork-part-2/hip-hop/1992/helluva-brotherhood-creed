1st verse
Hello Helluva!
Hey how you doin'?
It's me the Mac of BHC pursuin' ya
Who in the world gave you the right
To look so well, umm ah, DYNO-MITE?!

Suckin' on a pickle with a Now-a-Later in the middle
How I feel for you girl it's no riddle
I want her

Yeah I got to have her
She looks mo' better so I want her mo' badder
Than a thick man in quick sand- hope for help
At a glance, I'mma go for self

She's as cute as a Puss in Boots
With good hair and it's real to the roots
Damn near perfect all my life I've prayed
For an all world girl who's sweet as Kool-Aid

And thoughts of doin' that onion can make you cry
You're helluva babe
Oh me oh my

Hook
Helluva Helluva!
She's so fine
Helluva Helluva!
Blows my mind
Helluva Helluva!
Lights my need
Helluva Helluva!

She's a helluva girl yeah
The one I want in my life
She's a helluva girl yeah
The one I want in my life

2nd verse
I'm not the kind for nine to five
Cause I rhyme to survive
I guess I do alright
Cause I'm stayin' alive

I'm in the game of fame
Gang of girls want my last name
Not for love but for life in the fast lane
Golddiggers see dollar
So they scream and holler
At my concerts
Hopin' I notice 'em but it don't work

Cause I hate a girl loud as a speaker
Don't get me wrong I also hate salad eaters
Only's been bid to those in the mid
Of the two extremes
Yeah you know what I mean

Love is blind but I see good
I think you're helluva Helluva
Agreed B-Hood? Yeah!!!!
Yeah I knew you'd agree
There's no mistakin' she's B.A.D.!

I court her, support her, escort her and sport her
She's the talk of the town and I'm the reporter
She's Helluva

Hook
Helluva Helluva!
She's so fine
Helluva Helluva!
Blows my mind
Helluva Helluva!
Lights my need
Helluva Helluva!

She's a helluva girl yeah
The one I want in my life
She's a helluva girl yeah
The one I want in my life

3rd verse
We're still lovey dovey
But it ain't all roses
Cause she's so helluva
And other brothers know this

We can't even go in the mall walkin'
Without brothers hawkin', stalkin' and talkin' that talk
'Bout what they'd do if they were me
But she's locked up and "if" ain't the key

(wolf whistle)
I heard a brother whistle
I said "what up it's time"
I nut up and pull out my pistol

Load the clip and start git git gattin'
What happened?
Shee brothers stopped mackin'

Bend down and tell him it's not cause I'm jealous
Hey just don't disrespect me fella
Now she's mad cause she thinks that I'm violent
The treatment I git is.....
Silent

So yo bro know next time you slip there's a fee
You gotta pay
Hey cause Helluva's wit' me

Hook
Helluva Helluva!
She's so fine
Helluva Helluva!
Blows my mind
Helluva Helluva!
Lights my need
Helluva Helluva!

She's a helluva girl yeah
The one I want in my life
She's a helluva girl yeah
The one I want in my life
Repeat to fade
