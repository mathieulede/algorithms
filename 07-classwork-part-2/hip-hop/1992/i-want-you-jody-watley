When the night falls, surrounds us gently
With a sexy atmosphere
We'll light some candles, play some music
Ooh I just want feel that intimacy

Nobody but you and I
Loving and kissing so passionately
Sharing our feelings, just caress my body
Ooh baby let me whisper in your ear

I want your love
I'll have your love
I need your love
I want your love

I want your love
I'll have your love
I need your love
I want your love

Turn the lights down low
And baby come close
I wanna give it to you
Like you've never had it before

Unplug the phone
Don't disturb this groove
I just want to concentrate on you

Nobody but you and I
Just loving and kissing
So passionately
Sharing our feelings
Just caress my body
Ooh baby let me whisper in your ear

I want your love
I'll have your love
I need your love
I want your love

I want your love
I'll have your love
I need your love
I want your love
