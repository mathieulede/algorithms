[Verse]
In the morning when I wake I'm so thankful for another day
And I wanna testify
Got a job a roof overhead don't live fancy but my family's fed
I wanna testify
Got my strength and I got my health you can't buy that
With fame or wealth And
I just wanna testify
I get overwhelmed with thankfulness for things I have received
More than fame or wealth I feel the spirit inside movin' me
Looked around and can't ignore, there's so many things to be thankful for
And I just wanna testify
I got a joy that comes from within, deep in my soul I feel so content
And I just wanna testify
I searched high and I searched low, to find the answers only Heaven holds
And I just wanna testify
Too much joy, can't keep it to myself
I feel the need to tell somebody else
And I just wanna testify
Gifts of love that we all need, are provided if we only plant the seeds
And I wanna plant the seeds and testify
I just wanna testify

[Outro]
Feelin' light enough to fly
Lift your voice up to the sky
Come on join in and don't be shy
Get on your feet and testify
Feelin' light enough to fly
Lift your voice up to the sky
Come on join in and don't be shy
