[Verse 1:]
Putting on my coat
Wanna break out from these walls
Catch a bus and take a walk downtown
Maybe run into a friend
I just know I got to get out

But everywhere I go
I see lovers' hand in hand
Reminds me of the way it used to be
(Reminds me of the way it used to be, boy)
Baby it felt so right
When you were walking with me

[Chorus:]
Don't you see I'm cryin'
How could you leave me all alone
I'm cryin'
Just can't make it on my own
I dream of you the whole day through

But when the night time falls
I'm all alone
Cryin' all alone

[Verse 2:]
When I close my eyes
I can feel your lips on mine
Nobody ever touched me like you did
(Nobody ever touched me like you did, boy)

There ain't a thing
I wouldn't give, baby
For just one more kiss

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
My friends say I'll love again
I wanna believe but why pretend
Tell me why
Why pretend, baby?

I'm always gonna feel the same
No one will ever take your place
No nothing can compare
With the love that we shared, baby

[Repeat Chorus:]
