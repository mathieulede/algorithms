(Good Good Productions)

[Verse 1:]
Money pull up, who a the greatest?
Tip a likkle rum in a the Baileys
Baby you just a bubble and bare things
Mi get rich now, you see the changes

Dawg everybody happy what a day this
Roll up pon the sand like waves did
Half bottle a the rum and fi wash it off naked
Or two legs segregated

[Hook:]
Bumper round, mi walk go round
Bend over now fo touch you toe
Now you know you flexible
You feel like you waan fi fuck

Bumper round, mi walk go round
Bend over now fo touch you toe
Now you know you flexible
You feel like you waan fi fuck

[Chorus:]
Have you ever done it pon the beach?
Have you ever done it pon the beach?
Right inna the cool, cool, breeze
Sand pon you pum-pum cheek, baby
Don’t have no fear
Girl I’ll take you there
No don’t have no fear
Girl I’ll take you there

[Verse 2:]
Pretty eye Bette Davis
Bright up mi daylight savings
Drinkers unanimous wi deh a training
Champagne rain start tear
Bartender put an umbrella pon a glass fi the ladies
Magarita is her favorite
She take 100 hour fi ready
Mi been waiting
Mi nah lie, you look good still

[Hook]
[Chorus]

I'll take you there....
I'll take you there....

[Hook]
[Chorus]

I'll take you there....
