When I'm with you
I hear a song
That makes me laugh
And smile
And sing to you

When I'm with you
I feel so free
I feel that love
Is going
To take control
Of me

When I'm with you

It's for real
What I feel
When I'm with you

When I'm with you
I wonder why
People do stop
And stare
And smile at us

When I'm with you
The sun shines our way
Maybe our love
Reflects its rays of light
On everyone in the world

When I'm with you

It's so real
What I feel
When I'm with you

Special touch, a warm embrace
A sweet and tender, your smile, whoa
Body warm my heart, so pure
Chills when I look, look in your eyes

I wonder why
People do stop
And stare (And stare and smile at us)
And smile at us
When I’m with you, the sun shines my way
Baby, our love reflects its rays of light
On everyone in the world

When I’m with you
It’s for real (It’s for real)

What I feel (What I feel)
When I’m with you , you, hey, hey, hey

Oh, girl
I love you, baby
Ye-ye-ye-yes, I do
Ye-ye-ye-yes, I do
I’d give the world to you, baby
When I’m with you, whoa...baby

It’s for real (It’s for real)
What I feel (What I feel)
When I’m with you (You), yeah, yeah, eah, hey

Everything, everything’s alright
When I’m with you
It’s for real (It’s for real, what I feel)
What I feel (You’re heavy on my mind)
It’s okay (It’s okay, gonna pray)
Every day (Every day)
It’s so nice (So nice)
So right now (So right)
When I’m with you (You)
Nobody but you
Honey, I love you
