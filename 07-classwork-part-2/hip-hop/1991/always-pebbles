[Intro:]
[Pebbles:]
Cherrelle?

[Cherrelle:]
Yes, Pebbs?

[Pebbles:]
Have you ever loved someone so much
That you could feel it deep down in your soul?

[Cherrelle:]
Girl, I truly have

[Pebbles:]
Well, this is how I feel about the one I love
Let's sing it together
Always

[Verse 1]
Boy
I never knew a love like you before
You came into my life and gave me more
You are my friend
Also my man
And I'll love you always

You
You just don't know
What you've done for me
You gave me love and now I'm complete

You are the sun
The only one
And I'll love you always

[Chorus 2X]
Baby, don't leave me
Don't ever desert me
I'll promise my life to you
And I'll love you always

[Verse 2]
I
Wish I had known that you'd come for me
I was a soul that was lost and incomplete
You were my friend
And now you're my man
And I want you always

I
I just don't know what came over me
You touched my soul and let me feel free

Always be there
And baby, don't be scared
Cause I'll love ya always
Baby, always

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
My friend
You're my man
I do, I do, I do
I do love you

[Verse 3: Pebbles & (Johnny Gill)]
You, you should know now that I'd never leave you
When I've searched the land and now I've found you

(You are my girl) You are my man
(I am your man) My only man
And I'll love you always
Always

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro]
Baby, don't ever leave
Don't ever leave me, please
I promise unselfishly
To love you always

Baby, don't ever go
Don't ever leave me, no
All the things that we've been through
Still love you always

Baby, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go
Never leave you, no
You must stay always
And I'll love you

Baby, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go
Never leave you, no
You must stay always
And I'll love you always

Baby, don't ever leave
Don't ever leave me, please
I promise unselfishly
To love you always

Baby, don't ever go
Don't ever leave me, no
All the things that we've been through
Still love you always

Baby, don't you ever go
Don't you ever go
Never leave you, no
