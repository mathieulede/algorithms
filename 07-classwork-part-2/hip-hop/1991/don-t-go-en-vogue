I'm so glad to see you
Now I have the chance to say
Our love's been growing freely
What must I do to make you stay

Don't go

I feel the time is right
'Cause my love for you has grown
Up until this very night
I had doubts your love was strong enough
To break me down
Now I'm caught up in this web
You've spun for me tonight

Don't go

It takes a gifted man
To release the love in me
So far you're the only man
Who has gone this far for me
It feels it's out of my hands
Can't think twice, it's much too right
This may be my only chance

Don't go

I've been such a fool
To have kept my love for you
Could have lost your love searching for the truth
Don't go nowhere
You know I care
Stay right here with me forever baby

Don't go

Let's make sweet love tonight
I won't put up any fight
Your wish is my command
Lay me down upon my bed
And make me feel the heat
Of your body next to mine
I just have one demand

Don't go

You send chills down my spine
I surrendered all my love
You captured all my life
In just one night of ecstasy
You brought me to my knees
Your first bite was just to strong
You left a scar on me

Don't go

I've been such a fool to have kept my love from you
Could of lost your love searching for the truth

Don't go

I'm so glad to see you
Now I have the chance to say
Our love's been growing freely
What must I do to make you stay

Don't go
