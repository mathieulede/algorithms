[Verse 1:]
In my life, I feel so lucky
I've seen chances come and go
But reality has really struck me
I took advantage, hurt you so

[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew a love so sweet
Could knock me off my feet
But now I'm happy, baby
Since I met you
I never knew a love so strong
Could actually turn me on
But now I'm happy, baby
Since I met you

[Chorus:]
There'll never be another
Another like my lover
There'll never be another like my lover
There'll never be another
Another like my lover
Say there'll never-never be
Another-nother love like my lover

[Verse 2:]
Boy, you've got to believe me
Let's finish up where we started
Boy, you've got to forgive me
'Cause I never meant to break your heart
No!

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] (2x)

Give it up!

[Breakdown:]
Do you still want me?
Do you still want me?

[Chorus] (2x)

I'll be your lady
