We don't have to say good bye no no
Our love will last forever girl
Forever I will love you
Forever I will be true
Forever I'll always be here right by your side
And every morning I'll be there
When you open your eyes
Chorus
Never gonna let you down
I'll always be around
I'll be here for you
Because I love you
Never gonna let you down
I'll always be around
I'll be here for you, I love you
Never no never no never won't let you down
Whenever you call my name
It sounds so good
I wanna hear it over again
You'll never have to look around
If ever you need a friend
I'll hold you and I'll give to you
My tender loving care
Chorus
Oh.. How I've waited for so long
For someone just like you
To give to me the love that I've been waiting for
And yes, you took me by surprise
Opened up my eyes
Now I see and I know
Chorus
