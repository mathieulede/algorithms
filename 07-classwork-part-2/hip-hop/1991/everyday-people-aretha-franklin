[Intro]
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
Yo Gang, let’s kick the ballistics
Let’s party big time, oh
Get up everybody, Oh whoo yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm right, I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
A thinker, a banker, a drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
There is a blue one (uh-huh) that don’t accept the green one (what you say)
Cracking on the fat one (uh-huh), like I’m about to be a skinny one (oh)
Different strokes for different folks, and so on and so
Scooby dooby doo-yaa-doo-yaa-doo
Oh sha sha - we got to live together

[Verse 3]
I am no better and neither are you
We’re basically the same whatever we do
First you love me and then you hate me, you think you know me and then
You can't figure out if (in-audible)

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
There is a cone head (uh-huh) that don't accept the dome head (what you say)
Sisters and brothers (uh-huh) let's be cool with each other (oh)
Different strokes for different folks, and so on and so on
Etcetera, etcetera
Oh sha sha - we got to live together, yeah

[Bridge]
This track is killing me
Lord have mercy
Go go, go queen of soul [x4]

[Verse 5]
There is a yellow one (yellow one)
That ain't into the red one (red one)
We don't about the black one (black one)
Ha, What about white one y'all? (white one)
Different lengths don’t come with no dress
And so on and so on
Scooby dooby doo-bee-doo-yaa-doo

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge]
Want to take you higher
Higher, Higher

[Chorus][x2]
