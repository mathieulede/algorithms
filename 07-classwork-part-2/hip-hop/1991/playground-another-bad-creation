Song:   Playground

GA:
Comin from the playground
Take it straight back to the bricks
Yo Chris, tell em where it is

Chris:
Chillin, cooler den a squeak, kickin dirt on my sneakers
Suckers on the corner lookin down at their beepers
They couldn't get a job or a nice home
So they wanna stay and wait for the pay-phone
Take JoJo he's the youngest
Girls jock him cuz he's reverse dressed
?? strollin through the neighborhood
Sweatin their brother tryin to see why he's doin good
(sounds of sirens)
Rollin through the park tryin to make another hit
Little do they know that soldiers' legit
I'm not sayin this to put nobody down
This is what I see at the playground .. ya know!

GA:
Awww yeah! Another ABC smash.. gonna make ya mad!
Uh come on come on everybody
And guess who's up next..kick it!


Dave:

When im all alone..cold rockin on the microphone
At home .. ?playin under the phone

Pump it D pump it D pump it
Swing it D swing it D swing it


GA:

I dont wanna see nobody sittin in their chair
True dat! True dat! Yo Ro you are next!


Ro:
Well Im RoRo comin in third

And none of my rhymes will never ever be swerved

At the playground! ya know!

Ok..I guess you know by now
Big smash moves
Pants inside out

Mark:

Last but not least I wanna say PEACE and we outta here
From the playground..ya know!
