Love, what have you done
Oh wow
I was sure up til now that she was a friend
I stayed til the end
(Don't be a fool again)
I once believed that love was fair
But I don't anymore
She said i'm a bore
My heart hit the floor
(don't be a fool again)

Each time around I tell myself
It's the game of love
Ignore the signs and risk it all
In the name of love
Well i've decided i can't let nobody hurt me again
So I'll say it til the end
I just don't want to be a fool
(don't want to be a fool)
Said i don't want to be a fool ever again

Whenerver a fool's in love
He doesn't know he's to blame
He's caught in the game
It all ends up the same
H(he doesn't feel the shame)
He looks at love in a different way
It breaks his heart everytime
They all turn estranged
But he'll never change
(he's never going to change)

Next time around i'll tell myself
It'll be better than before
I won't look back
There'll be no one tearing my heart out anymore
I've just decided i can't let nobody fool me again
So i'll swear til the end
I just don't want to be a fool
(don't want to be a fool)
Said I don't want to be a fool
Ever again

(no way)
I mean no more
Never again
Ooh no never
Can't be
Noway
Noway, noway
Ooh, I don't want to be
I don't want to be a fool no

(i can't love anybody walking on a one way street
Anyway, anyway, anyway
If i don't find somebody
That'll be alright with me
I know, i know, it'll be alright now
'cause i decided not to let nobody hurt me again
So i'll say it til the end
I just don't want to be a fool
Said i don't want to be a fool
Never, neber again
(don't want to be a fool)
Can't be a fool
(don't want to be a fool)
Never again
