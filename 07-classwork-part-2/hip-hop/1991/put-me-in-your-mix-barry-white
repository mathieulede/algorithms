(Intro)
Put it in... In
Take my love and, put it in your mix

(Verse 1)
I'm waiting patiently
Hoping that I can be in your mix (I'm still here)
It's you that I adore
Just wait there's so much more, in my mix
Sweet as honey it can be
But you're the lock and you're the key
All the love you need is near
So open up and have no fear
Help to you I'll give my all
And I will be there when you call
I know the things that you can do
Just know I'm always there for you

(Chorus)
All you know
I'm the best you know
Put me in your mix
I need to be right there
I can love you right if we start tonight
In your mix

(Verse 2)
Something you need to know
How much I need you so, in my mix, yeah
So don't keep love to yourself
You'll find a greater wealth, in your mix
Smooth as honey it will be
And I'll love you with dignity
I want to be with you so much
I want to feel the way you touch
All the love you need is here
And No more lies & no more tears
Let me come inside your world
I can make your toenails curl


(Chorus)
For all you know
I might be the best you know
Put me in your mix
I need to be right there
I can love you right if we start tonight, in your mix

(Verse 3)
I need to be there
For all you know
I'm the best you know
Put me in your mix
I know just what you like
Give me a chance tonight, in your mix
I need to be right there

(Barry White speaking)
You never know... You just might reeeally like it
So please, please, put me in your mix

(Outro)
Don't you know for all you know
I'm the best you know
Put me in your mix
I need ot be there, right there, I need to be right there
I can love you right if we start tonight...in your mix
For all you know, I'm the best you know
Put me in your mix
