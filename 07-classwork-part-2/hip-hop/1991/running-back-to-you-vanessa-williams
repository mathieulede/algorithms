[Verse 1:]
Boy, you've been running around to long
Now, I think you're running out of time
No more jumping in and out of my bed
It's time for me to draw the line

[Hook:]
So you think you can call me
The only one
Then walk out the door
And you think you can run around having fun
And just come back for more

[Chorus:]
I think you're living in a fantasy
It's got to be them or me
So if you try it one more time
Baby don't expect me to come running back to you

Running back to you
Then you'll think about love
All the good I gave to you

I won't come running back
Running back to you
I won't come running back
Running back to you
And I'll find someone, somebody else to give it to

Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back
I won't come running

Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back
I won't come running

[Verse 2:]
Boy, hope you see before to late
I won't play the fool
No, not this time

And I'll show you just how wrong you are
To think I just
Can't get you out of my mind

[Repeat Hook:]

[Chorus:]
You can't dis me when you wanna
Or come and go when you wanna
I hear you're playing around when you wanna

Anytime that you wanna
Or just tell me lies when you wanna
I got more than you want oh
Oh, and by the way

Oh, oh
I won't come running back
I won't come running

Oh, oh
I won't come running back
I won't come running

Running back to you
Then you'll think about love
All the good I gave to you

I won't come running back
Running back to you
I won't come running back
Running back to you

And I'll find someone
Somebody to give it to

Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back
I won't come running

Oh oh, oh oh
I won't come running back
I won't come running
