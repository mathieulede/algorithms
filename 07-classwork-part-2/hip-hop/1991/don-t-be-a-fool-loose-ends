Dreams are dreams and they do come true
I believe in dreams, don't you
We all need something to hold on to
Analyze the situation
You have got to take control
Do the best in what you think you know

You've got to tell yourself
Try and you will progress
There's more to life than you know
Don't give up the fight
Take one day at a time
You've just got to have hope, so...

Don't be a fool, don't throw your life away
Don't be a fool, don't waste your life away
Don't be a fool, don't throw your life away
Don't be a fool, don't waste your life away

Sort your life out

Sleepless nights, hallucinations
Can't get up, the day is through
Here's the night, the stars they look at you
Puff the Magic Dragon's got you
Locked into his highs and lows
Then you find it harder to break through

You've got to tell yourself
Try and you will progress
There's more to life than you know
Don't give up the fight
Take one day at a time
You've just got to have hope, so...

Don't be a fool, don't throw your life away
Don't be a fool, don't waste your life away
Don't be a fool, don't throw your life away
Don't be a fool, don't waste your life away

Sort your life out

Don't be a fool, don't throw your life away
Don't be a fool, don't waste your life away
Don't be a fool, don't throw your life away
Don't be a fool, don't waste your life away
Don't be a fool, don't throw your life away
Don't be a fool, don't waste your life away
Don't be a fool, don't throw your life away
Don't be a fool, don't waste your life away

Sort your life out
