Chorus:
No fear, no shame, you don't have to worry
'Bout a thang
No fear, no shame, you don't have to worry
'Bout a thang

Makes no difference
Near or far, baby
It's you I love no matter where you are
My dedication will never die
I'm always faithful till you break my heart
You don't have to keep seaching for dishonesty
It's always safer to let your love flow
I can guarantee
There's no need for doubting me
There is no other that's worth the trouble

Chorus

There's no reasoning for your dismay
Our love's been good up to this very day
No time for wondering
It's takes away
From all the time we have to share together
You can best believe
No one can just come between
Me and you and what we built together
I guess in time we'll see where our dedication leads
And in the end I know I'll be there for you

Chorus

Bridge
I can guarantee there's no need for doubting me
No time for wondering
You can count me
