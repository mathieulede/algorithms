J-J-J-J-J-Just wanna be your girl
J-J-J-J-J-J-Just wanna be your..
Don't wanna change it
Aah, aah, aah
They know I ain't no saint, I ain't no politician
Baby, that's not my way
I just wanna be the one you give your love to
Each and every day
Since I saw you, boy, I've only got one ambition
That's to win your heart
Ain't no better cause, don't give me other mission
I've got to have you home
Don't wanna change the world
I just wanna be your girl
Don't wanna change the world
I Just wanna be your girl
Don't wanna change it
I used to spend my time just working for a dollar
Never had too much fun
I'll be working steady building up my power
The power of one
But since I saw you, boy, I've only got one ambition
That's to win your heart
Ain't no better cause, don't give me no other mission
I've got to have you home
Don't wanna change the world
I just wanna be your girl
Don't wanna change the world (Don't want to change the world)
I just wanna be your girl (I wanna be, I wanna be your girl)
Don't wanna change the world (I don't wanna change the world)
I just wanna be your girl (Ooo, I wanna be your girl)
Don't wanna change the world (Don't wanna change the world)
I just wanna be your girl
Some folks live their lives with onlu one desire
Seeking fortune and fame
Seems they only wanna set the world on fire
That's not for them, but that's not my game, ooh
Don't wanna change it
[Rap]
As I appear to glare, stare deep into your eyes
Mesmerized by the tides that hold us together
Wishful thinking me and you one-on-one, lovers, friends forever
Give me the chance to romance and I remind you
They've got a serious future behind you
So come on over here, girl, and do what you please
And don't sweatin' me for checkin' out your groceries
Why do I sweat when I got the juice?
I'm just a girl with a plan, nothin' on the loose
You see, you're the kind of guy that needs my affection
My love and protection, but to be affection
Don't be fronting on me, you know who I am
And other sisters you do just don't give a damn
So brother, I don't want to change your world
All I want to do is be your girl
Understand what I'm sayin'?
I want to be your girl, ooh
Don't want to change the world, I want to be your girl
[Musical interlude]
Don't wanna change the world (don't want to change the world)
I just wanna be your girl (I wanna be, I wanna be your girl)
Don't wanna change the world (I don't wanna change the world)
I just wanna be your girl
Don't wanna change the world, I want to be your girl
Don't wanna change the world (don't wanna cha-ange)
Just wanna be your girl (I wanna be, I wanna be)
Don't wanna change the world (Don't wanna change)
I just wanna be your girl, I don't want to change the world
Don't wanna change the world (I don't wanna change the world)
Just wanna be your girl
(I just wanna be, just wanna be, yeah-eah)
Don't wanna change the world (Don't wanna change...)
I just wanna be your girl
