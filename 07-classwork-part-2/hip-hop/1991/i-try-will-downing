I TRIED TO DO
THE BEST I CAN FOR YOU
BUT IT SEEMS NOT ENOUGH
AND YOU KNOW I CARE
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT

YOU CLOSE YOUR DOOR
WHEN I WANNA GIVE YOU MORE (I WANNA GIVE YOU)
AND I FEEL, I FEEL SO OUT OF PLACE
AND YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
DON'T YOU THINK I'M GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU???

CAN'T YOU SEE (CAN'T YOU SEE)
THAT YOU'RE HURTING ME
AND I WANT THIS PAIN, I WANT THIS PAIN TO STOP
SO IF YOU REALLY CARE, I MEAN, IF YOU REALLY REALLY CARE
THEN OPEN UP YOUR HEART TO ME

YES...OPEN UP TO ME, TO ME, TO ME, TO ME
AND I REALLY REALLY TRIED

YOU KNOW THAT I TRY
AND I TRY AND I TRY AND I TRY TO MAKE YOU

AND I TRY, AND TRIED AND I TRIED AND I TRIED AND I TIRED AND TRIED

YOU KNOW THAT I TRIED

AND I NEED TO BE WITH YOU

I TRIED...I NEED YOU

YOU KNOW THAT I WANTED

I'LL DO ANYTHING TO KEEP YOU SATISFIED MY LOVE (TO SEE YOU THROUGH)

BECAUSE I WANT YOU AND I NEED YOU

YOU KNOW THAT I TRIED

I TRIED, I TRIED...
