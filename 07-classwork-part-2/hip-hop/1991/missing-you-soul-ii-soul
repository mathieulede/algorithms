Ooh, yeah
You're the sweetest
Yeah, baby
Oh, yes, you are
You're the sweetest
Yes, baby, ooh...

Dreaming of you alone
Feelings in my mind and thoughts of you grow
On and on through the journey
In time that day I know will come

Drop of rain from the sky
A prayer, a miss on his lips, yeah
A glance, a smile and suddenly life comes alive

That's the way I'm missing you, boy
(Your love is so sweet)
That's the day our love will unfold, oh
(Missing you)
That's the way I'm missing you, boy
(Your love is so sweet)
That's the day our dreams will unfold, oh, yeah, yeah

I wait for you until the time is right
I hope and pray each and every night
To make you happy, sometimes blue
I need to feel, feel for you

Drop of rain from the sky
A prayer, a miss on his lips, yeah
A glance, a smile and suddenly life is alive

That's the way I'm missing you, boy, mmm
(Your love is so sweet)
That's the day our dreams will unfold, oh
(Missing you)
That's the way I'm missing you boy
(Your love is so sweet)
That's the day our dreams will unfold, oh..

Ooh, baby, ooh..
The sweetest, yeah, yeah

As the morning comes, I'll open my eyes
And think once again, am I dreaming?
Is this true, I know our love will come through
Because, baby, you're the sweetest

That's the way I'm missing you, boy
(Your love is so sweet)
And that's the day our love will unfold, oh
(Missing you)
That's the way I'm missing you, boy
(Your love is so sweet)
That's the day our dreams will unfold, oh, yeah
(Your love is so sweet)

And you know that I know I'm missing you
Wanting you, loving you, my love is true
And you know that I know my love is true
Missing you, wanting you, my loving you
And you know I know my love is true
Missing you, wanting you, and I'm loving you
And you know that I know I'm loving you
Missing you, wanting you, my love is true
