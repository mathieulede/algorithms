[Intro:]
Ah, ah
(Whoa, oh)
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
(So, so hard, girl)
Ah, ah
(I gotta)

Mmm...
I'm â€˜bout to do this
Oh, I guess it's one of those things
A man just has to do
But I promise
It'll work out for the better, baby
Trust me

Ah, ha
Ah, ah
(I gotta)

[Verse 1:]
I've been feeling lately
Like being single or just alone
To get into myself

Love ain't easy
Making me crazy
Games that we play
Sometimes the rules have to change

I don't wanna treat her cruel
But I like honesty
So what am I gonna do?

[Chorus:]
I guess I'll do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry
But it's hard to live a lie

So I gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
Though I love the girl
I know that
The best thing is for us to be apart

Ah, ha
Ha, ha
(Be apart, baby)
Ha, .ha, ha, ha, ha
(Hoo)
Ha, ha
I gotta

[Verse 2:]
Any good relationships starts
Inside of a happy man
I think she will understand

If I tell her straight up
Then she can only respect me
Even if we don't agree

I don't wanna treat her cruel
But I like honesty, baby
So what am I gonna do?

[Chorus:]
Oh, I've gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry
But it's hard to live a lie

So I gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
(Break her little heart)
Though I love the girl
I know that
The best thing is for us to be apart

Listen, baby
Hoo

[Bridge:]
Oh, sugar, no
(Do what I gotta do)
I gotta do what I gotta do

Oh, baby
(What am I gonna do?)
Oh, let me break it to you gently
I don't want to
(Do what I gotta do)

All that I can do, do
(What am I gonna do?)
Hoo, hoo

Do, do, do, do, do
(Do what I gotta do)
And I don't wanna see you cry, baby
But what am I gonna do?

[Chorus:]
Oh, I've gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
I don't wanna see her cry
But it's hard to live a lie

So I gotta do what I gotta do
And break her heart
(Break her little heart)
And though I love the girl
I know that
The best thing is for us to be apart

Do what I gotta do
And break her heart
(Her heart, girl)
I don't wanna see you cry, baby
But you know that it's driving me crazy

Do what I gotta do
And break her heart
(Hoo)
And though I love the girl
I know that
The best thing is for us to be apart

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
(I know it's gonna work out for the better)
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, .ah
(And the best thing is for us to be apart)
