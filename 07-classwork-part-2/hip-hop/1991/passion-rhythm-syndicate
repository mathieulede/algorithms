[Verse 1]
You blow, I blow
Indica, outdoors
Watch my rhythm, that's Hublot
Never falling off, late night is over
New age rap king, call me Hova
I don't spar, but send a sword full of doja
Smoke and mirrors, image don't get exposure
Airplane ride
Boy going high
No I'm not The Weeknd
I earned my stripes
Yeezus blessed me in a dream
He said Valentino, Shamrock is the team
You got a Glock, I got a laser beam
Man, I'm so Martin, I got a goddamn dream
Said come over, then I came over
I was all on her land like a rover
Pause, this shit is cheesy
Made a song before it got sampled by Yeezy
6 in the syndicate, 6 grand at the gate
6 hoes on the dinner plate
I'm a beast, you can't relate

[Bridge]
Ain't no trap phone, ain't no map home
Or caps blown, or that dome
At home, no red bone
The covers blown
The xan zone, flew back to Rome
A few hoes, I didn't bone
But I'd like to know

[Hook]
Why, Why, why, why I
Feel it inside
Even when I push it aside
I just wanna fly
But I can't leave, can't stay
Where I am, I am
Can't go away
Don't get why you gotta play
When I don't want play
Just ride with me, just fly with me
If my sentence is deadly
Just ride with me
Just die with me, Just ride with me
Just fly with me
If my sentence is deadly
Just die with me, like

[Breakdown]
Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
T-Syn, Yeah
T-Syn, Yeah
T-Syn, Yeah

[Verse 2]
​Bitch, what you mean?
Just like New York, I do it for my Queens
Flowers for the dire themes
Cherubs couldn't teach me to fly with wings
The sour things
What you feel is how I feel
On the other side of things, I'm proud of me
I'm proud of him and them
If I pulled a card out a deck
All Kings, no Queens
And like the hearts, I wear them on my sleeve
Just ride with me, just fly with me
If my sentence is deadly
Just die with me
Just ride with me, just fly with me
If my sentence is deadly
Just die with me
(You blow, I blow,)

[Bridge]
Ain't no trap phone, ain't no map home
Or caps blown, or that dome
At home, no red bone
The covers blown
The Xan zone, flew back to Rome
A few hoes, I didn't bone
But I'd like to know

[Hook]
Why (x6), I
Feel it inside
Even when I push it aside
I just wanna fly
But I can't leave, can't stay
Where I am, I am
Can't go away
Don't get why you gotta play
When I don't want play
Just ride with me, just fly with me
If my sentence is deadly
Just ride with me
Just die with me, Just ride with me
Just fly with me
If my sentence is deadly
Just die with me, like

[Breakdown]
Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
T-Syn, Yeah
T-Syn, Yeah
T-Syn, Yeah

[Verse 3]
​Question
Forgot to mention
Talking to you through the wire
You feel the tension
I'm caught in your dimension
Pockets on early pension
Bad bitch
She gon' need detention
This life don't need more stressing
I got the juice, so go on drink me up
Pour my heart out to your childish ass in a sippy cup
I fill her up, 'til she say that's enough
Suck her dry when she's out of love
I ascended, this the life for a god
I got a bone to pick, I guess I'm still a dog
If anyone test me, Imma give it all
Leave a dead body, blood dripping in the stall
T-Syn
