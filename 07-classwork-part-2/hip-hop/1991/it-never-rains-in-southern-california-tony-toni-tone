[Verse 1]
I haven't seen your face in a year
I can't wait till I get there
Just to kiss and squeeze and hug
Girl you know the rest cause they tell me

[Hook]
It never rains in southern California
It never rains in southern California

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll take the flight out tonight
And you can pick me up about 8
I don't know what airline girl
But I know it won't be late cause they tell me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I can't sleep at night
Without your 8 x 10 by my side
That day will come
For us to be together
I'm not worried 'bout a thing
Not even stormy weather...

[Refrain]
Oh it may be cold on the east coast
But on the other side of town it never rains...

[Verse 4]
We have so much to talk about
A lot a catchin' up to do
I'll bring the diamond girl
Because I'm so into you
Cause they tell me...

[Hook]

[Verse 5]
Now since I'll be here at your place
Lets take a weeks trip for two
We don't have to go to far
Just as long as I'm with you
Cause they tell me...

[Hook]

[Verse 6]
Can we just be alone
Without those other strangers
Calling your phone
Now I don't want to be
That selfish kind of guy
But tonight let me take you
On a natural high
Just me and you alone

[Refrain x2]

[Hook x2]
