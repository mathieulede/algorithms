Come baby, find me, come baby
Remind me of where I once begun
Come baby, show me, show me you know me
Tell me you're the one
I could be learning, you could be yearning
To see behind closed doors
But I will always be emotionally yours
Come baby, rock me, come baby
Lock me into the shadows of your heart
Come baby, teach me, come baby
Reach me, let the music start
I could be dreaming but I keep believing
You're the one I'm livin' for
And I will always be emotionally yours
It's like my whole life never happened
When I see you, it's as if I never had a thought
I know this dream, it might be crazy
But it's the only one I've got
Come baby, shake me, come baby
Take me, I would be satisfied
Come baby, hold me, come baby
Help me, my arms are open wide
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling
Even to foreign shores
But I will always be emotionally yours
