[Verse 1]
One night not long ago
I fell for you
Too easy to let go
She was one from your past
One of the few
You said it didn't last

[Bridge]
Now Romeo you know I can't believe
Your tongue would slip so easily
I know you think I oughta let it be
But get it right, next time
That's the end of me

[Chorus]
My name is not Susan
So watch what you say
If you still need her
Then be on your way

Don't want to hear about Susan
She's got nothing on me
So show some respect for the love you receive
My name is not Susan
(No, no, no, no, no -- get it right)

[Verse 2]
Last night you were asleep
Deep in a dream
I heard you call her name
Then you turned to embrace
I froze in place
Never to be the same

[Bridge]
Now Romeo you know I never knew
My heart would bust so easily
I know you think I oughta let it go
But get it right next time
Say good-bye to me boy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I never want to be the girly that you "call" one and only
You know the kind of girly
That you would call when you get lonely
I never should have let you in
A damn shame
Forgot my name!
Well, anyway

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Don't want to hear about Susan
My name ain't Susan
Ya better get it right!
