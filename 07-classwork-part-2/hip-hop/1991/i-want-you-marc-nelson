Yeah, uh uh, yeah

I want to be the first one to say
That I really like you
Feeling some attraction
I want to see you looking my way
All I want to do is hold you, because

*Chorus*
Love's not love until you're mine all mine
Love's not love till I feel your touch
I want to be close to you
And I want you so much
Love's not love until you're mine
Love's not love until you're mine

From the very moment we met
I know I would never want to be away from you
Baby after all that we said
All I want to know is if you want me to

*Chorus*
But love's not love until you're mine all mine
Love's not love till I feel your touch
I want to be close to you
And I want you so much
But love's not love until you're mine
Love's not love until you're mine

All the never is true
Not ashame to tell you
That my heart is lying
When you walk into the room
All you leave beside me
And wondering baby

*Chorus*
Love's not love until you're mine all mine
Love's not love till I feel your touch
I want to be close to you
And I want you so much
Love's not love until you're mine
Love's not love until you're mine

Love's not love until you're mine
Love's not love until you're mine (until fades)
