Here we go

[Verse 1]
Yo, a day in the life of a player named Quik
I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick
And just because I drink the 8, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc-ness
Now this is how we do it when we checkin a grip
Teddy Bear's in the house, so don't even trip
We're bustin funky compositions as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm
It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin off the hook *brrrrrring*
And AMG is in the den reviewin' rhymes in his notebook
Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack *brrrrrring*
I pick up the phone and it's the D (whassup nigga?)
He said he's comin down at about two on the dot
So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot
And now I'm soakin, a brother like the devestatin DJ Quik ain't jokin
Fuck with me on DSP and you'll get broken
My name is Quik, but you can call me Daddy
Yo, open up the door 'cause here come Freak Man in a Caddy
Now Freaky's in the El-Dog and Shabby's in the ElCo
And everybody's sippin on a quart (here we go)
D just came with a forty and a quart
In addition to the three that Greedy just bought
But I don't wanna start early, so I just might
Put my forty in the freezer 'cause I wanna get bent *tonite*

[Hook]
Tonight is the night (yeah) *tonite*
Tonight is the night *tonite*
Tonight is the night (yo, when we gon' get bent) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (aww yeah)

[Verse 2]
And now I'm out of the tub, I'm feelin' fancy free
Spray on some Xeryus and put on my Givenchy
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim
And it's a medium, fit me proper 'cause I'm nice and slim
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin
And I am steadily thinkin about the 8 that I'll be drinkin
You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful
So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful
Hamm is in the bedroom rollin up a stencil
Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil
Freaky lit it up and hit it one, two, three
Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me
(It's the bomb!!!)
Yo, I can feel my senses (gettin' numb!)
Yo, fuck the forty ounce (I need some rum)
I'm chillin' like a villain (here I come)
And that's how I'm livin'
Tonight is the night and I'm lookin' real sporty
Proper Friday evening, and I'm ready to party
Crusher came in with a handful of snaps
Fuck it, let's shoot some craps
(Yo what they in fo') A fin or a half
(Yo shoot that ten, nigga) Don't make me laugh
Hi-C won a dub and he think that shit is funny
But I'm seven and eleven and I'm takin niggas money *tonite*

Tonight is the night (yeah, watch me bust a ho) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (passin' naturals on motherfuckers) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (yo, I'm unfadeable) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (ahh, let's break it down, so I can get funky)

*tonite*

Ahh yeah
Givin' em somethin they can roll on

[Verse 3]
Wake up Saturday morning, and I got a headache
I can't believe that I'm sick from all the shit that I drank
*Last night* Soon as I felt it comin on, I shoulda quit
It's true that a drunk ain't shit
To the man up above to whom thanks I give
I'll never drink again if you just let me live
Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it
Callin' Earl like a mother while I'm grippin the toilet
I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin
Round and round, I think I better sit down
My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feeling faint
I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't
K is on the phone, and Teddy's at the door
And some fine ass bitches comin over at four
(I thought you wasn't drinkin no more) Yeah right
Because as soon as they come, we doin the same ol shit *tonite*

Tonight is the night (yeah) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (straight gettin fucked up, heyyy) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (fuck that pass me that pina colada) *tonite*
(man I don't wanna fade that 8 Ball no mo)
Tonight is the night (that shit be fuckin a nigga up) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (ahh yeah nothin but a party and I'm kickin it)
(what's up Pete and Greg) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (how you livin?) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (hey somebody get that nigga a Genuine Draft)
(yeah) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (and on that motherfuckin note, I'm outta here)
(See-ya) *tonite*

*tonite* (Repeat until end)

We out (What about peace?)
Fuck peace, nigga, give me another brew
