Forever
Forever
Forever

[Verse 1:]
So you're having my baby
And it means so much to me
There's nothing more precious
Than to raise a family

If there's any doubt in your mind
You can count on me
I'll never let you down
Lady, believe in me

[Pre-Chorus:]
You and I
Will never fall apart
You and I
We knew right from the start, baby, baby

The days
We fell so far in love
Now our baby is born
Healthy and strong
Now our dreams are reality

[Chorus:]
Forever my lady
It's like a dream
I'm holding you close
You're keeping me warm
If this is ecstasy

Forever my lady
(Forever my lady)
I say just what I mean
Forever and ever
I pray is what I see
Yes, my baby

[Verse 2:]
Can you picture, my lady?
This empty scene
There's no me or no you
What will we do?
An awful sight to me

If I ever lose you
Tell me where would I go
Life would have no meaning
And I pray that you
Would always stay with me

[Repeat Pre-Chorus:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Repeat Pre-Chorus:]

Forever my lady
Yeah
Forever my lady
Whoa
Said I pray every night, baby

Forever my lady
And every day of the week
It's like a dream
Yeah

I'm holding you close
You keeping me warm
