If you really mean what you said to me
And you got to have me in your life
If I'm all you need, all you'll ever need
Starting with tonight

If you're ready now, if you have no doubt
And your love is something that you're
Really sure about
And you couldn't live without

If you're serious
If you wanna make it last
If you're serious
Then this is all I ask

Just believe in us
All we have to do is try
If you're serious
So am I

If you wanted this like I wanted this
And you cannot wait any longer
And this means to you what it means to me
Oh, baby

Then I ready now and I have no doubt
My love for you is something that I'm
Really sure about
And I couldn't live without

If you're serious
If you wanna make it last
If you're serious
Then this is all I ask

Believe in us
All we have to do is try
If you're serious
So am I

Still some nights I lie awake and wonder
How we're ever gonna make it
And I think a lot about how much it's gonna take
And I think about how much we had each day

If you're serious
If you wanna make it last
If you're serious
Then this is all I ask

Just believe in us
All we have to do is try
If you're serious, baby
So am I

Ooh
If you're serious
So am I
