I can remember stories
Those things my mother said
She told me fairy tales before I went to bed
She spoke of happy endings
Then tucked me in real tight

She turned my night light on
And kissed my face good night
My mind would fill with visions of perfect paradise

She told me everything
She said he'd be so nice
He'd ride up on his horse and take me away one night
I'd be so happy with him
We'd ride clean out of sight

She never said
That we would curse, cry and scream & lie
She never said that maybe
Someday he'd say goodbye

The story ends as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise of fairy tales
Uh
No, uh, huh
Mmm, mmm

She spoke about happy endings
Of stories not like this
She said he'd slay all dragon
Defeat the evil prince

She said he'd come to save me
Swim through the stormy seas
I'd understand the story
It would be good for me

You never came to save me
You let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness
Alone in the cold

My story end as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise
No fairy tales
Yes

I don't look for pie up in the sky, baby
Need reality now
Said I don't feel the need to be pacified
Don't you try
Honey, I know you lied

You never came to save me
You let me stand alone
Out in the wilderness
Alone in the cold

I found no magic potion
No horse with wings to fly
I found the poison apple
My destiny to die

No royal kiss could save me
No magic spell to spin
My fantasy is over
My life must now begin

My story end as stories do
Reality steps into view
No longer living life in paradise
No fairy tales

Eh
Hey, hey, eee
Mmm, mmm
Lord have mercy
Oooh
Oooh
Mmm
Oh Lord
