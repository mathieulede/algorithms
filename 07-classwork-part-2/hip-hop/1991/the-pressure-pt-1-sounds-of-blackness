[Intro:]
I need relief!

[Verse 1:]
My back is against the wall
More bills than money to pay
But I know just who, who to call on
When I need relief I pray to help me fight

[Chorus:]
The pressure, the pressure, the pressure, pressure of the world
The pressure, the pressure, the pressure, pressure of the world

[Verse 2:]
Playin' on the tension and your weakness are addictions
That lure your mind astray
You can fight it, you can win
For your deliverance, just bow your head and pray
To help you fight

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
We all have our burdens to carry
I know when mine get to heavy
He's always there to bear the load
Give me strength and comfort any time I need relief
From the pressures of the world I just believe
