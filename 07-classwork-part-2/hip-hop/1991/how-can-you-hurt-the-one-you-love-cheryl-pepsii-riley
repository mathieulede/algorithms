Sometimes you can take but so much
Well I think I had enough

(chorus) Ooh oh how can you hurt the one the one you love
Ooh oh oh
No more pain
No more suffering
No more physical abuse from you
From this day on
You will hurt me no more

(chorus) Can't take it anymore
I can't take it any, anymore
How can you hurt the one you love

(chorus)How can you hurt the one you care for
(em em)
Form this day on there will be no more
My body has suffered
But you keep on hitting me
Everytime you say sorry
See I keep forgiving
But when will these hands
I keep asking again (ooh,ooh,ooh,oh)
It ends right here and now
Its gonna stop, stop right here and now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now!!
How can you hurt the one you love

(chorus) How can you hurt the one you care for
(ooh,ooh,oh)
From this day on there will be no more
You use to say (you use to say)
That you love me so much
But you were
Killing me softly (killing me softly) with every touch
And I was a fool yeah
Cause you were so crule (yeah eeh eeh eeh)
Im not taking it anymore
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no never again
Will you knock me down to the floor..........
I use to love you
I, I, I, I use to love ............
But you never loved me
How can you hurt the one you love
(oh ooh ooh eeh)
From this day on ther will be no more... Pain

(chorus) How can you love when there is no love there
How can you love when theres no love there
From this day on you keep your hands to yourself
How can you hurt the one that you... love........
You won't hurt me, no more........
