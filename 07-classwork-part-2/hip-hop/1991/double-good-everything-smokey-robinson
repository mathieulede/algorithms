It's paradise, paradise
It's ecstasy, ecstasy
It's awful nice, awful nice
Having you loving me

It's wonderful, wonderful
It's very true, very true
It's double good everything
Being loved by you

What'd I do to deserve this
Makes me stop and wonder
Who am I?
What would make you want to serve this
To just another ordinary guy

Twice as good as any feeling
I have ever known
To call my own

I said, it's paradise, paradise
Well you know it's ecstasy, ecstasy
It's awful nice, awful nice
Baby, having you loving me

You know that it's wonderful, wonderful
(Wonderful, wonderful)
Oh, very true, very true
(Very true, very true)
It's double good everything
(Double good everything )
Being loved by you
(Being loved by you)

You got an over abundant
Amount of everything I seem to need
You gotta know you're the one
When I just have to follow where you lead

Keep that loving coming to me
Don't let up one bit
Don't ever quit

Because it's paradise, paradise
Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy
It's awful nice, awful nice
Baby, having you loving me

Oh, you know it's wonderful, wonderful
Yeah, very true, very true
It's double good everything
Being loved by you

Well, being loved by you
(Being loved by you)
Being loved by you
(Being loved by you)
Being loved by you
(Being loved by you)
Being loved by you
(Being loved by you)
Being loved by you
(Being loved by you)

Oh, being loved by you
(Being loved by you)
It's double good
Double good
(Being loved by you)
Double good, double good
(Being loved by you)
Being loved by you
