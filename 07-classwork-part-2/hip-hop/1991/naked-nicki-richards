Won’t you shelter me?
“Oh baby, this is a serious thing.”
Turn up the bass

[Verse 1:]
See a glisten on my skin
That’s my freedom
It’s the state I’m in
I am naked
I am stripped
Of my illusion
Down to my fingertips

[Chorus:]
I’m naked to the world
(Rip off the cover, time to make that change)
I’m naked on the Earth
Won’t you shelter me
(Rip off the cover, time to make that change)

[Verse 2:]
Naked in your arms
Keep it secret
Keep me safe from harm
Tender talkin’
All night long
‘Cause in the morning
I’ll be in the storm

[Verse 3:]
I’m naked to the world
(Rip off the cover, time to make that change)
I’m naked in rebirth
Won’t you shelter me
(Rip off the cover, time to make that change)
(Rip off the cover, time to make that change)
(Rip off the cover, time to make that change)
(Rip off the cover, time to make that change)

I need some shelter, people
Oh won’t you shelter me

[Bridge:]
It’s in a naked body
It’s in a naked soul
It’s time to get to know
The skin that you uncover
It’s in the eyes of your lover
It’s in the eyes of the beholder
And it’s in the purple flower
That is yet to be discovered
