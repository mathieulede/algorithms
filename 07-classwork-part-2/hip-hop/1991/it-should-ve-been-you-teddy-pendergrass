Mmm

I dreamed of you last night
And oh, your face was so very clear
All I could do was think about the good times
That you and I used to share

I could remember the last time
Oh, I held you in my arms
But all those days have come and gone now
And all I seem to do is cry

It hurts {It hurts}
Remembering how things used to be
We thought our love {Our love}
Could last throughout eternity
Now it's history, baby

It should've been you, whoa
It should've been me
It should've been all those that life
Was meant to be

But if I had you, oh, babe
This time you'd see
You would have all my love
I kept {I kept} inside {Inside} me

Now you've got somebody else
Yes, I've got somebody too
But you know I've finally realized
No one could ever take the place of you, no

I'm not the one to place the blame
Or for whatever the fault just might be
All I need is to find a little happiness
Oh, in life that will fulfill me

It's you {It's you}
It's you that means more to me
Without your love
It's nothin' more than fantasy
Baby, come back to me, whoa

It should've been you, whoa
It should've been me
It should've been all those that life
Was meant to be

It should've been you
It should've been me
We could've built a love so strong
But my eyes were closed and I didn't see

Oh, it should've been you
It should've been me
It could've been all the that life
Was meant to be, was meant to be, meant to be, babe

Oh, if I had you, girl
This time you'll see
This time you would have all the love
That I kept, oh, I kept, I kept inside of me

Oh, it hurts {It hurts}
Remembering how things used to be
We thought our love
Could last throughout eternity
Now it's history, whoa, baby

It should've been you (It should've been you, baby)
It should've been me (Should've been me)
It could've been all those in life (All those things in life)
That was meant to be (That was meant to be), oh, baby

I know, I know, I know, I know it should've you
It should've been me
We could've built a love so strong (We could've built a love so strong)
But my eyes were closed and I didn't see

It should've been you (It should've been you, baby)
Oh, it should've been me (Should've been you and me)
It could've been all those in life
That was meant to be, that was meant to be, oh

{Could've been, should've been you}
Oh, I know if I had you, girl
I know this time you'll see (This time you'll see)
I'll show you, baby (I'll show you, baby)
You could have all my love
All the love, all the love I kept wrapped up inside of me, oh yeah

Why don't you give me one more chance (Why don't you)
If you wanna be with me
Take a chance with me, baby
I woke up this morning with you on my mind

Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Come on
Try it again
Let's start all over
We can make it work this time
Come on
