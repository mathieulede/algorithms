[Verse 1:]
I'm so confused
And I think I'm gonna cry tonight
What must I do, babe?
You don't know what you mean, oh
Tell me something
Tell me could this really be

You're so unpredictable
Why must you treat me this way?
I want you to love me
For who I am

[Hook:]
Whatever happened to the dream
We used to share?
Where did our love go?
Boy, don't you even care?

[Chorus:]
Tender kisses
Blown away
Tender kisses
Gone tomorrow, gone today
Tender kisses
Bye baby, bye baby

[Verse 2:]
Don't leave
Leave me here all alone
I want someone I can call my own
I may be young
But I'm ready
Ready to fall in love

Im so confused
You're so unpredictable
Trust in me
As I trust in you
Put our hearts together
There's nothing we can't do

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I wonder if you ever loved me
Tell me, was I so blind
That I could not see

Holding on to the memories
Of the way you used to kiss me
All I ever really wanted
Was someone to call my own

I'll never know
You'll never know
We'll never know
All those tender kisses blown away

Bye baby, bye

[Repeat Chorus:]
