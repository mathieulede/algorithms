[Intro:]
Help me
Save me
Save me
Save me

[Verse 1:]
Creatures in wilderness
Ooh, wild are we
Pleasure seeker obsessed
His eyes on me
Him in his corner, me in mine
Circling around me
Surrounding me like fire
He pressed against me
Lips on mine
I stare into his eyes
I, I, I, I'm…

[Chorus:]
Fallin', won't you save me, save me
Fallin', won't you save me, save me

Like the rain that comes from above
Ooh, it's unstoppable
As I lie here, face to the sky
With arms open wide
I feel the rain surrounding me
Coming down so hard I can barely see
Quiet desire inside of me
Crazy as it seems
I, I, I, I'm…

[Chorus]

He brings out things in me that I've never seen (never seen)
How far can he make me go, baby I don't wanna see
'Cause I'm wild for him

[Vamp:]
Save me, save me, save me, save me
Won't you save me? Save me?

[Ad-Libs:]
I can't believe the things you do for me, boy
You got me goin' crazy
You got me goin' crazy, babe
Crazy
Won't you save me?
Baby, won't you save me?
