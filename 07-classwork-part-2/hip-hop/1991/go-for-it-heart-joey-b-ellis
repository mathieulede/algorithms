Go for it, that's right, that's right [repeat 3]

To be or not to be, dope, that's the question
Are you gonna stop or keep on rushing
For the better, quicker than the next man
To be the best is the master plan
Go on with all you've got, give it your best shot
Don't ever think about trying to stop
Keep reaching, pushing, hoping for perfection
Make up your direction, don't ever stop for a moment
Prove you want it
If you got it flaunt it and get up on it
Go for yours, not for a minute but for all the time
You better so it cause I'm going for mine

Go for it, that's right, heart and fire yeah
Go go go, I see it in your eye
Go for it, heart and fire
Go go you've got to go for the feeling

It's time for the rhyme of the bold and the gifted
Listen closely and you'll get lifted
Higher than you ever been before
Get more than you bargained for for sure
Life can be a trick for of trouble
But you got to stand up and fight back double
Don't let nothing hold you back
Yo when life says stop you say go go go
Reaching, growing, teaching, knowing
Is that a preaching that each and every one of you are blowin
Get youself together, keep moving
Don't let nothing stop your flowing
Go for what you want, don't hold back
Cause I know you got the knack
So go farther than you've ever been before
I'm going for mine, go, so go for yours

Go for it, that's right, heart and fire yeah
Go go go, I see it in your eye
Go for it, heart and fire
Go go you've got to go for the feeling
