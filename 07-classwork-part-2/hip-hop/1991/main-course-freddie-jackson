Now how does a guy like me
Get to know a pretty lady like you, pretty baby
I know that it sounds like a line
But I had to throw it at you, hold me, better catch me
If only you knew that I would cherish you
And give me a chance to let my love go down
You’ll find I’m the one that you’ve been lookin’ for
Baby, all your life, yeah
If you taste a little bit of my love (Taste it, baby)
I promise you, girl, you’ve got the full main course
And if you taste a little bit of my love (Taste it, baby)
I promise you, girl, you’ve got the full main course
I don’t wanna appear to be rude
But your mama made you for me, your father’s really cookin’
Now I might sound crazy to you, girl
But it sure would be a sin if I never see you again
Girl, you don’t know how much you turn me on
Please give me a chance to let my love throw down
You won’t regret a single second, minute
Hour, day or rest of your life, no
If you taste a little bit of my love (Taste it, baby)
I promise you, girl (Oh, yeah), you’ve got the full main course (If you)
And if you taste a little bit of my love (Taste a little bit)
I promise you, girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah), you’ve got the full main course
If you taste a little bit of my love (Taste it, baby)
I promise you, girl, you’ve got the full main course (You got the main course)
And if you taste a little bit of my love (Every little bit, baby)
I promise you, girl, you’ve got the full main course (Oh...oh...oh...)
Ooh, baby
Everything, everything
Everything, everything
Baby, baby
I’m in love, I want you
Oh, ho, oh, oh, oh, ho...
Hoo...ooh...ooh...
Every little bit of love
If you taste a little bit of my love (I promise you, baby)
I promise you, girl (Hey), you’ve got the full main course (You want it all)
And if you taste a little bit of my love (You want every little bit)
I promise you, girl, you’ve got the full main course (Come on and taste a little bit)
If you taste a little bit of my love (Taste a little bit)
I promise you, girl (Yeah...), you’ve got the full main course
And if you taste a little bit of my love (Taste a little bit, try a little of my love)
I promise you, girl (Hey), you’ve got the full main course (You’re gonna want it all)
If you taste a little bit of my love (Yes, you will, every little bit of my love)
I promise you, girl, you’ve got the full main course (You want the main course)
And if you taste a little bit of my love (The main course, yes, you will)
I promise you, girl, you’ve got the full main course (You want the main course)
If you taste a little bit of my love (Oh, try a little bit)
I promise you, girl (Try a little bit), you’ve got the full main course (Ooh, ooh)
And if you taste a little bit of my love (Ooh, ooh)
I promise you, girl (Hey, hey), you’ve got the full main course (Ooh...ooh...ooh...ooh...)
