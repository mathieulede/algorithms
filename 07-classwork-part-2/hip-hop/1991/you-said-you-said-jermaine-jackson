His girl and I
Laid from bed from time to time
Don't ask, me why
I never was that kind of guy
She said in time
I'd be hers and she'd be mine
I thought my my
Soon found out it was a lie
Just like a fool, there I waited
A year or two, you delayed it
Why did you lie, while you led me
On and on and on and on

[Chorus:]
You said, you said
It'd be alright
You said, you said
Hold on boy and give it time
You said, you said
It'd be alright
Well I don't need that kind of love
In my life

Out with my pride
I kept whackin' on the side
I can't deny
I know my noSe was open wide
Soon she'd be gone
Love ain't happenin' in her home
She said bye bye
But it was said to the wrong guy
You felt so good, drove me crazy
I fell for you, who could blame me
How could you lie, you just led me
On and on and on and on

[Chorus]
Never thought I'd be with a girl who wasn't free
Never planned to share in another man's love
Never thought I'd be the one taken for a ride
Taken for the ride of my life

You said, you said
It'd be alright
You said, you said

Never thought I'd be with a girl who wasn't free
Never planned to share in another man's love
Never thought I'd be the one taken for a ride
Taken for the ride of my life

[Chorus]
You said in time you would be mine
You told a lie I took a ride
Out went my pride, my nose open wide
Wide, wide, wide, wide
You said it's good, I said it's wrong
You said you'd leave, but you're still at home
Just like a fool I stayed alone
Why..

[Chorus]
You said baby, you said mama
You said baby, you told a lie
I don't know why
You said baby, you said mama
I don't need that kinda love
In my life
