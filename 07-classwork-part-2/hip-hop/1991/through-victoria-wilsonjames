Ahhh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
First you tell me lies
Then unconvincing alibis
I see right through
Just can't stand you
Treating me like dirt
Honey, my nerves you know you worked
Going about things wrong
Ciao pretty boy, I'm gone

I'm through
Oh yeah, you're busted it's true
I'm not gonna spend my whole life feeling blue
No way, yeah, through
Let the door knob hit ya where the dog shouId have bit ya

It's only yesterday it started out in a routine way
The phone rang and on the other end a voice sang
What was said couldn't be so
But she said things only you and me know
Places, times and dates
When you'd come home from the office late
Evidence for evermore
All is fair in love and war
If this is war then I'll win it
Your car's still running so get in it

I'm through
You're dry, you're busted
Through
Not going to spend my whole life feeling blue
No way through, we're through, we're finished
(Through) Yes indeed it's really true
(Through) There can be no me and you

Tried so hard for a while
This is not, not my style, no no
Well, well it's too bad that you've lost the best
Thing you'll ever have
Hello, why are you calling me?
I told you time arid time again
Don't tie my phone up with your nonsense
You had your chance but blew it
You made your bed so lie in it
Don't even come to me with this because I really don't need it right now
I am too busy

This drama must now end the rest of your things I'll send
Go your separate ways
There's nothing left for you to say
You just sing the same old song
You love doing wrong
You can make amends and by the way no, we can't be friends

I'm through
Yes indeed, it's really true, true
There can be no me and you
Through, tried so hard for a while
Through, this is not my sty le
Through, you're busted
Through, I'm not gonna spend my whole life feeling blue, no, no, oh

Through, that's right, we're finished
(Through) Yes indeed, it's really true
(Through) There can be no me and you
(Through) Tried so hard for a while
(Through) This is not, not my style
