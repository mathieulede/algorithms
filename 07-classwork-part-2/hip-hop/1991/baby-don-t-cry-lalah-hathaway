Oh boy, what you tryna do to me
Come and knock me off my feet
Uhh with one touch your love makes my soul complete
Its like I'm raising from defeat when you whisper softly

[Chorus]
Baby,baby don't cry (its better to dry your eyes)
Baby baby just fly away with me

Hey love, you can always count on me
So you'll never set me free
Holding on to us, '
Cause what we have us oh so rare
Only feelings can compare when you hold me gently and say

[Chorus]
