[Verse 1:]
Somethings Wrong For I Can Tell Is It That Someone New Came Alone And Broke The Spell There's A Dought That I Can Shake Emptyness In Your Kiss I'm Finding Hard To Take If You're Having Second Thoughts If You Think We Should Let Go After All We've Been Through I Should Be The First To Know Sweet And Sensecurity Ohh Its Slowly Killing Me I Got To Know Baby Tell Me How You Feel

[Chorus:]
Are You Still In Love With Me Like The Way You Use To Be Or Did It All Just Fade Away And The Pain I Feel Is It Here To Stay Are You Still In Love With Me Like The Way You Use To Be Or Did It All Just Tumble Down And The Pain I Feel Is It Here To Stay

[Verse 2:]
In My Heart I Won't Except In My Mind I Know It Can't Be True That I'm Slowly Loosing You I Can Only Try To Bring Love Back A Live But There's Somthing In My Mind That Says I'm Running Out Of Time I Would Call You On The Phone Just To Hear You Say Honey I Love You Always Ooh I Miss Those Days Now I Feel So All Alone Tell Me Where Did We Go Wrong And Tell Me Our Love Is Here And No It Hasn't Disappeared

[Chorus:]
Are You Still In Love With Me Like The Way You Use To Be Or Did It Sll Just Fade Away And The Hut I Feel Is It Here To Stay Are You Still In Love With Me Like The Way You Use To Be Or Did It All Just Tumble Down And The Pain I Feel Is It Here To Stay
