[Intro:]
Uh
Stone to the bone, baby
Yeah
Whos the mack?
Stone cold
Baby, I'm stone cold

[Verse 1:]
Am I what you're missing?
The kind of guy
Who gives you a dozen roses everyday
Shower you with hugs and kisses
And making sure
That you get love in each and every way

My mama told me to remember, boy
She says
A woman is your pride and joy
And that's why I treat you with seniority
A gentleman is what I strive to be

[Chorus:]
I'm a stone cold gentleman
I do all that I can
Give my heart
My charm
My personality

I'm a stone cold gentleman
So, girl
Just take my hand
Cause you've been missing out
On what is chivalry

Yeah
Stone cold gentleman
Aw, baby
Stone cold
Baby, I'm stone cold

Here we go
Come on
Here we go
Come on

[Verse 2:]
Now I
Baby
Don't mind giving
Giving you  the kind of love
That I know you deserve

Cause I'll be there, yeah
24-7
To treat you nice
Day and night
Oh, baby
Just say the word

And I will open every door for you
Send you letters
And some sweet perfume

I'll call you up
To say I love you so
I do special things
Cause I want you to know

[Chorus:]
I'm a stone cold gentleman
I do all that I can
Give my heart, my charm
My personality

I'm a stone cold gentleman
You've been missing out
On what is chivalry

I'm a stone cold gentleman
And I'll treat you right
Give my heart
My charm
My personality
Cause baby, I'm stone cold

[Verse 3:]
She kinda got a future behind her
She gotta lotta future behind her
Big, bright future behind her
You know it
Hey, excuse me, baby

I'll open doors for you
Send you some sweet perfume
I'll call you baby
Don't you know?
Oh, I do special things
Cause I want you to know

Here we go
Come on
Here we go
Come on

[Bridge:]
I'm a stone cold gentleman
But I don't like a girl
That tries to get too fly

Remember that day I spoke
You kept walking
Pulled up in the Benz today
And you were honking my boys

And all of a sudden
You started giving the rhythm up
It's plain to see
You're just out for the benjamins

Yo, Rizz
Ain't she the one
That stepped at the high?
Ha
B
And I ain't even trying to go out like that

Stone cold
Baby,I'm stone cold

Baby I'm not no casanova
But I'll give my heart
I'll give you my charm
Baby, I'm a gentleman

And I'm not trying to win you over
Just give me your hand
And I'll do what I can
Baby, Im stone cold

[Chorus:]
I'm a stone cold gentleman
I do all that I can
Give my heart
My charm
My personality

I'm a stone cold gentleman
So, girl
Just take my hand
Cause youve been missing out
On what is chivalry

Baby I'm cold
Aw, sugar
I'm cold
Aw, I'm gonna treat you nice
Day and night
Day and night, baby

Baby, say the word
And I'll be right there
Ooh
Gonna open every door for you
Just for you, baby

I'm a stone cold gentleman
I do all that I can
Give my heart
My charm
My personality

I'm a stone cold gentleman
So, girl
Just take my hand
Cause youve been missing out
On what is chivalry

Im a stone cold gentleman
I'll treat you right
All day and night
Baby, I'm stone cold

I'm a stone cold gentleman
I'll treat your right
All day and night
