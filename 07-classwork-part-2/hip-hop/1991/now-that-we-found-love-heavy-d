Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it (x2)

[Verse 1]
One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up, rev me up
My little buttercup
We can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not
Here comes the brother with glow
A strugglin', bubblin' overweight lover hug pro
So what's it gonna be
Me or the TV
Now let me take time
To set your mind and your body free
So why don't you just stretch
Stretch for a sec
Lay down your problems
So I can cop a quick [?]
Shake me, shake me
Baby Baby bake me
No need to fake here I am
Come on and take me
Wind your body
Baby move your body
I see you slip sliding
Come on and do it hottie
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling hunky–dory
About this thing that I found

[Hook]
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it (x2)

[Verse 2]
I like the way you wiggle
You don't jingle, but you jiggle
So spread open your love
Cause it's Heavy in the middle
Move it like a mover
She wanted to groove
So I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn
So we played school and I schooled her
(Mary had a little lamb)
But not like this
We can toss and turn
Rumble, tumble and twist
Anything you want, I'll give it
Fantasies we'll live it
So lay down and relax
Lover, my lady
Lady lover, my baby girl
Spread your wings
So we can fly around the world
Harmony, charming me
Your fingertips are calming me
When you dropped the kisses
Suzie Q, you dropped the bomb on me
Stretch it, stretch it
Flex it, flex it
Gimme the permission
Okey-dokey
I'll bless it
Bless it like buddha
Buddha has to bless
We can lay down after loving
Put your head on my chest

[Hook]
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it (x2)

[Verse 3]
What can we do
What are we gonna do
Roses are red and violets are blue
Love is good and plenty
If you get plenty good lovin'
Kiss you where you're hot
Give what I got to keep you bubblin'
Do me right, do me right
My lonesome dove
Tell ya man one time
What is this thing called love
I'm not quite sure
As to what is going down
But I'm feelin' hunky–dory
About this thing I found

[Hook]
Now that we found love
What are we gonna do with it (x4)

[Outro]
Here we go, keep it funky
Put your hands together, y'all come on
Bring it back one time
All up in money earning Mount Vernon
This one's dedicated to you
Know what I'm saying
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Manhattan
The whole New York City
I said I love ya to death
And ya don't stop
Ya don't quit, ya gotta keep on
Until the d-d-do it like this
Ya don't stop, ya don't quit
Ya gotta keep on and on and on

Yeah
Alright
Oh yeah
