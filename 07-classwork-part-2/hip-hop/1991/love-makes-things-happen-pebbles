You never know
You never know it
You never know
You never, never, never
Never, never know
No, no, no, no
You never know

[Pebbles]
Deep in the heart
Love has many ways
Of touching your emotions
Taking control of you

And even in thought
Love can make you change
There's no way of controlling love
When it's part of you

[Babyface]
Well you could be a married man
With two kids and a good woman
And you could give your heart and soul
I swear it don't mean nothing
'Cause love can pull you deep into a spell
It will spin your mind around like a carousel, oh

[Chorus]
I'm telling you love, boy, makes things happen
You never know where it's coming from
You never know who you're gonna love
I'm telling you
Love makes things happen
You never know what you're gonna do
Whenever true love takes hold of you

[Babyface]
There's never a time
'Cause love will let you know
Love appears at the worst
And even the best of times
Takes over your mind
Your heart is not your own
There's no way of controlling love
It controls your life

[Pebbles]
Well, you could be a faithful girl
With a good heart and good intentions
And you could never leave your home
I swear there ain't no preventions
'Cause love can pull you deep into a spell
It will spin your mind around like a carousel, oh

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[Babyface]
There's nothing love can't make you do
When love takes hold of you
You can have the purest heart
And the finest attitude

[Pebbles]
But I swear that don't mean nothing
When your heart's under the spell
It will spin your mind around like a carousel

[Chorus (repeat until end)]

[Babyface & Pebbles (starting over second Chorus)]
You never know
You never know it
You never know
You're never gonna know it, baby
Who you're gonna love
Who you're gonna love, baby

You never know
You never know it
You never know
You're never gonna know it

You never know
You never know it
You never know
You never, never, never
Never, never know
No, no, no, no
You never know

You never know
You never know it
You never know
You never, never
Never, never, never know
No, no, no, no

You never know
You never know it
You never know
You never, never
Never, never, never know
No, no, no, no
You never know

You never know
You never know it
You never know
You never, never
Never, never, never know
No, no, no, no
You never know
