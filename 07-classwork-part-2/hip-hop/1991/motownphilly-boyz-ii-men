[Intro: Boyz II Men]
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris (Michael McCary)]
It's long overdue but now
Philly is slammin'
Boyz II Men, A B C, B B D
The east coast family
Never skipped a beat (nah)
While cooling on South street
Jet black Benz, plenty of friends
(And all the Philly steaks you can eat)

[Wanya Morris (Shawn Stockman)]
Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
(Could it really happen?)
Or do dreams fade away
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth
So we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

[Interlude: Michael Bivins]
Yo these four new jacks is real
Smooth on the harmony tip
Nate, Mike, Shawn, and Wan
You know the mentality
Keep flippin the gift

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman (Nathan Morris)]
The spotlight is on us now, watch us do this
(Da da, daaa da da, da da da da da da)
Live and direct from Philly town
(Rap and hype and we can get down)
We are ready to roll
So now the world will know that we were

[Wanya Morris (Boyz II Men)]
Back in school we used to dream about this everyday
Could it really happen? Or do dreams fade away
(Then we started singing, and they said it sounded smooth)
So we started a group and here we are
Kickin' it just for you

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

[Bridge: Boyz II Men]
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Then we started singing them
They said it sounded smooth

[Verse 3: Michael Bivins]
Now check this out, one day back in Philly
Four guys wanted to sing they came up to me
I said "Well what's your name? (Boyz II Men!)
Hey, you know what I'm sayin'?"
Then I said, "Alright fellas
Well let me see what you can do"
And then with a smile, Wanya said
"Yo Mike, check this out, see if this one moves you"

[Interlude: Boyz II Men]
Doom doom doom da da, doom doom doom da da
Da di da di da da, da da, daa daa oh
Doom doom doom da da, doom doom doom da da
Da di da di da da, da da, daa daa oh

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Motownphilly's back again
Doin' a little east coast swing
Boyz II Men going off
Not too hard, not too soft

[Outro]
Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men, Boyz II Men
Boyz II Men, Boyz, Boyz, Boyz, Boyz II Men, A B C, B B D
