Wooo hoooo
Sensitive thats what I am Make no mistake about it
Cause little things Certainly mean so much to me
Maybe I should tell you That I have my faults
And there are no gurantees Oh Babay can't you see
I'm only human Don't ask me for too much too fast
I'm only human babe I'll be so carefull not to ever hurt you
Emotional thats what I am Feelings run deep inside me
I trust my heart and usually It never lets me down
But every now and then, I guess, I lose my way
Like people often do And that just goes to prove
I'm only human Don't ask me for too much too fast
I'm only human Hey babe
I'll be so very carefull not to ever hurt you baby
You know I love you Its easy to see That I do
And I'll always be the best I can But girl I'm just a man
So darling please be patient If we both beleive
We will make changes as we go
Oh, I just want you to know
I'm only human Don't ask me for too much too fast
I'm only human uh ohh
I'll be so very carefull with you baby
I'm only human baby Don't ask me for too much too fast
I'm only human oh baby
I'm just a man baby
And I'll be the very best I can Baby
