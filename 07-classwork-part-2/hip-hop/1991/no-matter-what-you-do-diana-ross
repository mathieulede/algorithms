Yeah, hey, I never thought I'd feel this way
(Al, don't play with me now)
Please, can you take the hurt away?
(Al)
My love for you is a bottomless well
For your tears and your fears
And I do love you
No matter what you do
I love you all the same
I said no matter what you do
I'll love you all the same
No matter what you do
I love you all the same
No matter what you do
I love you all the same
If we take our time I know you'll be mine
If we were to share our love would always be there
(No matter what you do)
If you decide to go then we will never know
But if, if you'll stay our love would find a way
(I love you)
No matter what you do
I'll love you all the same
I said, no matter what you do
I'll love you all the same
No matter what you do
I'll love you all the same
No matter what you do
I'll love you all the same
(Yeah, say it to me)
Do you love me? Let me know
Don't keep it inside, let it show
If you and I were meant to be
In your dreams you'd see the things that I see
(No matter what you do)
If you don't want me just tell me honestly
(I want you)
You know I can't take this pain
So please hold me now and whisper my name
(Diana)
Hold me, I just want you to hold me
(Like this?)
I love you
(Yeah)
No matter what you do
I'll love you all the same
(I never thought I'd feel this way)
I said, no matter what you do
I'll love you all the same
No matter what you do
I'll love you all the same
No matter what you do
I'll love you all the same
No matter what you do
For evermore, for evermore, for evermore
For evermore
(I love you, I love you)
Ooh, baby, what we're doing
Who we fooling?
Let's stop hiding from the feelings
That we feel inside, yeah
No, no, no, no
I never thought I'd feel this way
I just want you to hold me
Alright, you've got to stop playing with me now
If you're serious there's no more fooling around
(Okay)
No hiding
(No more hiding)
Just show your feelings
(I wanna spend the rest of my life with you)
God bless the day that you came
No matter
