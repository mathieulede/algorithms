[Verse 1:]
I fell out of bed
This morning
Oh, something was bugging me
I couldn’t sleep
Cause I hadn’t had any loving

So I’ve got to
Solve this problem out, baby
And darling
I know what the remedy should be

[Chorus:]
At night
When I turn out the lights
I want someone to wrap my body tight
A lover
To keep my body warm
I need a woman to wrap my body tight

[Verse 2:]
As the day goes by
Thought weighs heavy on my mind
Only thing I think about
Is tonight the lights go out

Ooh
And I hope it’s you tonight
But not just tonight

Every day and every night
I want your love
Hold me
Sweet, sweet love

So I’m telling you my problems
Because I know you
Know exactly what I need
Woo

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

Ooh
Come on, come on
And squeeze me, girl

Wrap, wrap my body
Wrap, wrap my body
Real tight
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge:]
Girl, I have to solve this problem out, baby
And I know what the remedy should be
I need someone to hold me
I need a woman right here
Right here next to me

[Repeat Chorus x3:]

Come on
Work me
Hold me
Love me
