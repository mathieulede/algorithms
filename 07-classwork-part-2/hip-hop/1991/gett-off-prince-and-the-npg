[Verse 1]
How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve
There's a rumor goin' all round that u ain't been gettin' served
They say that u ain't you know what
In baby who knows how long
It's hard for me to say what's right
When all I wanna do is wrong

[Chorus]
Gett off - 23 positions in a one night stand
Gett off - I'll only call you after if you say I can
Gett off - let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off - If you want to baby here I am (Here I am)

[Verse 2]
I clocked the jizz from a friend
Of yours named Vanessa Bet (Bet)
She said you told her a fantasy
That got her all wet (Wet)
Something about a little box with a
Mirror and a tongue inside
What she told me then got me so hot
I knew that we could slide

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
1 2 3 - Nah, little cutie, I ain't drinkin' (Gett off)
Scope this, I was just thinkin'
You and me, what a ride
If u was thinkin' the same
We could continue outside (Gett off)
Lay your pretty body against a parkin' meter
Strip your dress down
Like I was strippin' a Peter Paul's Almond Joy
Let me show you baby I'm a talented boy

(Everybody grab a body
Pump it like you want somebody
Gett off (gett off))

So here we-so here we-so here we are, here we are (G-G-Gett off)
In my paisley crib
Whatcha want to eat? "Ribs"
Ha, toy, I don't serve ribs...
You better be happy that dress is still on
I heard the rip when You sat down
Honey them hips is gone
But that's alright, I clock 'em that way
Remind me of something James used to say...
"I like 'em fat"
"I like 'em proud"
"Ya gotta have a mother for me"
Now move your big ass 'round this way
So I can work on that zipper, baby
Tonight you're a star
And I'm the big dipper
(Kick it)
(Gett off)
(Gett off)

[Bridge]
How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve (gett off)
There's a rumor going all round that you ain't been getting served (gett off)
They say that you ain't you know what
In baby who knows how long (gett off)
It's hard for me to say what's right
When all I wanna do is wrong

[Outro]
Gett off - 23 positions in a one night stand
Gett off - I'll only call you after if you say I can
Gett off - let a woman be a woman and a man be a man
Gett off - I you want to baby here I am
Come on
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
Gett off
