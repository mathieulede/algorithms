[Intro:]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, hoo, hoo

Way higher, yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1:]
All I wanna do is just explain
Why that we feel the way we do
(Ooh)
What a joy to share with you

For me to live is Christ
To die is gain
If anymore
I need to say
The list goes on and on all day

[Hook:]
I'll cherish that moment for life
And I know it might sound crazy
It's all right
Take a seat
Hold tight

[Chorus:]
Time to admit
(Time we should admit it)
I'm so addicted, yeah
You see
He's taken my heart
And showed me the right way

No doubt about it
(Doubt it, no doubt)
See, I'm lost without it
Yeah
You see this love takes me higher
I didn't know why then

I found it was addictive love
Yeah
(Woo, hoo, yeah)

[Verse 2:]
Now that we've evened up the score
Hey, what do you mean there's so much more?
I need to tell why we adore
The reason why I smile
When I
When I wake up

And also the reason
Why I dream
(Reason why I dream)
My love
My joy
My everything

[Repeat Hook:]

[Bridge:]
So much love
He's given to me
Everything I longed for
Everything I need

That means I'm never alone
So glad
And everything
I've dreamed and much more
(Much more, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So much more

And I'll cherish
(Cherish the moment)
That moment for life
For the rest of my life, yeah, yeah

And I know it might sound crazy
But
(It's not crazy)
No
I'm not crazy

I've never known anyone to
Love me quite the way you do
And I tell you
It's hopeless

I've finally noticed that
(Hopeless)
I'm just forever addicted, forever
(Forever in love)
Hey
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Repeat Chorus x3 w\ad-libs:]
