Oh, I don't wanna lose you love

(Take a deep breath)

Ohh

Dinner's ready
And the wine is chilled
My baby's coming over
Oh, you know just how I feel

Because I don't wanna lose your love
Think how it feels, baby
It's getting harder to conceal, yeah

Do I fit in the life that you're living, boy?
(Baby, say I do)
Do you feel all the love I've been giving you?
Oh, when I come home
Do you care to see me?
Things ain't the way they used to be, baby

I don't think you really wanna leave me
You've got to say just what's the reason
Don't take my love for granted, boy
And then turn around
And do me, whoa

I don't wanna lose your love
(I don't wanna)
I don't wanna lose your love (ooh)
Don't wanna lose your love
(Don't wanna lose)
I don't wanna lose your love
(Oh, come on)

Come on and say that you will
(Just say you will)
I'll do the best to fulfill
(I will be there)

I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

I think you need my love
(My love)
You can't defeat my love
(My love)
You won't abuse my love
(Ooh, oh)
I don't wanna lose your love

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Well, well, well, well

You just don't know
What you do to me
I wanna ask you something
Hey, baby, hey, baby
(What's up)
I think we can make it
How bout you

But don't just send me away
To be alone
(Away)
I don't think I can take it
(I ain't going nowhere, baby)

Cause if you tell me to go
(You know I will)
I will leave you (for sure) alone

Don't ask me to stay
Don't do me wrong, yeah
(I can never do you wrong)

Do I fit in the life that you're living, boy?
(Baby, say I do)
Do you feel all the love I've been giving you?
Oh, when I come home
Do you care to see me?
Things ain't the way they used to be, baby

I don't think you really wanna leave me
(Don't go)
I think you're confused
And you don't want to believe it

You can't take love and just walk away
With the guilt that you carry
You'll be back someday
Whoa

I don't wanna lose your love
(Don't wanna)
I don't wanna lose your love
(Don't wanna lose)

Don't wanna lose your love
(Your love)
I don't wanna lose your love
(Oh, oh)

Come on and say that you will
I'll do the best to fulfill
I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

I don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love
Don't wanna lose your love
I don't wanna lose your love

Oh, hey
