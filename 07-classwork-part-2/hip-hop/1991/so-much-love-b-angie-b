Oh, ey
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, hoo, hoo
Ooh, hoo, hoo

Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo
Oh, hey
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hey

It's 6:00
And I'm just waking up
To another lonely morning without you

Go get my coffee
And I think to myself
(I think to myself)
Just what am I gonna do

Well, I need some help to understand
And only you can make it clear
Why do you have to look for love out there
When there's so much love here?
Yeah (hea, hea)

I spend so much time
With you on my mind
I barely can make it through the day
Ooh, hoo
Fighting the urge to pick up the phone
And call just to see if you're okay

Then I hear your voice, oh
You stop on by (stop on by) by
And my worries disappear
Why do you have to look for love out there
(Ooh, boy)
When there's so much love here?

Whoa, oh
Oh, oh, oh

You're always on the run
I know you're having fun
Pretending to look for that very special someone

But if you keep on disrespecting me
I know there's gonna be
A day when you're gonna find me gone
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ho, ho, ho

I'm gonna defend you right or wrong
I'm always on your side
And you know I'm the one to soothe your soul
When there are troubles on your mind

It's just a waste of time to try and find
Another love that's better than mine
I'm telling you
The dream will never appear, no, no

There's no need to look for love
(Don't have to look for love)
Out there
When there's so much love here
(So much love, so much love)

(I wanna ask you something)
There's no need to look for love out there
(Why)
When there's so much love here?
(I just don't understand)

There's no need to look for love out
(Woo, hoo, hoo)
When there's so much love here
(So much love, so much love
I want you to have all of my love)
There's no need to look for love out
When there's so much love here
