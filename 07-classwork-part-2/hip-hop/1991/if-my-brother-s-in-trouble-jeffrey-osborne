I think i finally know you
I can see beyond your smile
I think that i can show you
That what we have is still worthwhile
Don't you know that love's just like the thread
That keeps unravelling but then
It ties us back together in the end

(chorus)
In your eyes, i can see my dream's reflections
In your eyes, found the answers to my questions
In your eyes, i can see the reasons why our love's alive
In your eyes, we're drifting safely back to shore

And i think i've finally learned to love you more

You warned me that life changes
That no one really knows
Whether time would make us strangers
Or whether time would make us grow
Even though the winds of time will change
In a world where nothing stays the same
Through it all our love will still remain

(chorus)
In your eyes, i can see the reasons why our love's alive
In your eyes, we're drifting safely back to shore
And i think i've finally learned to love you more
