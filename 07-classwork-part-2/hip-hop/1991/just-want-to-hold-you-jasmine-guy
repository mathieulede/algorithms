[Verse 1:]
You're the very best
I ever had
But I don't want to move too fast
No

Too soon to let
Our true feelings show
And if we make love now
Then you'll never know

[Chorus:]
That I
I just want to hold you
And I
I never told you

That I
I want this love to last
So let's not move too fast

[Verse 2:]
I love you more than
Than making love
So tell me
What you're thinking of

Am I more than just a fantasy?
'Cause I'm hurting, boy
Can't you see?
Ooh

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I want you
I want you
I need you
I need you
And I'll be yours for the rest of my life

I want you
I want you
Yes, I need you
Oh, I need you, baby
And I'll be yours for the rest of my life

[Repeat Chorus:]

Slow it down
Slow it down
You're moving too fast for me
