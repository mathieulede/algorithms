Justice, people say, justice
Justice, brother say, justice
Judge me if I am weak
Judge me if I am strong
Judge my days and all life long
They let the baby cry, let the mama cry
And youths like I and I have to cry
For justice, one, one, one word prayer
Justice, who yea, justice, justice
Is like a good friend
Who long time we don't see
Why they taking liberty
Who, is like a good friend
Who long time we don't see
Why they taking liberty, with I and I and I
Justice, yea yea yea
Justice, now not later, justice
Justice, people say
For I and I, justice, justice
Justice, where are you
Justice, look what they do
They make the innocent cry
The innocent cry
Look what they do to Garvey
They make the innocent die
They make the innocent die
How dem lie on Steve Biko
Justice, justice, the one word prayer
Justice, who yea, justice
The poor man cry, why do they do the wrong
Justice, they make me sing this song
Justice, who yea woa, mmmh, yea, yea
Justice, justice, desert me not
Justice, they are on my back
Justice, the more the tears
The more, the more we want, justice, justice
