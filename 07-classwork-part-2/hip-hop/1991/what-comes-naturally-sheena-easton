Let's get together and do
What comes naturally

I've been holding back my love
For such a long time
Nobody's come along that
I would want to call mine

My phone's been ringing but
My heart, it just won't answer
I can't pretend cause
It's love I'm after

(I've been looking)
I was not prepared for
What I saw in your eyes
I saw something I've been
Waiting for a long time

(Let's get together)
We just met but I know
That you're no stranger
I can tell that
My heart's in danger

I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally
There's a time to be wild
There's a time to be free
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally

I could play hard to get
But what good would that do me
You'd look into my eyes and
You would see right through me

This is a powerful feeling
That we're feeling
I can't deny
It's my heart you're stealing

(I've been looking)
I want to tell you now
That I am not afraid
I'll let the walls come down
Tonight I'm feeling brave

(Let's get together)
The risk is worth
Any chance that I'm taking
This could turn out to be
Love we're making

I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally
There's a time to be wild
There's a time to be free
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally

I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally
There's a time to be wild
There's a time to be free
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally

Oh, oh, baby
Set your love free
Falling in love
Should come naturally

Get together and
Do what comes naturally
Get together and
Do what comes naturally

Crazy, crazy, it's getting kind of wild
Is that a yes I'm seeing in your smile
I don't know you, but I feel we're connected
One look from you and baby I'm affected

I can tell that you're reading my thoughts
But let me tell you now I'm not afraid of getting caught
The risk is worth any chance we're takin'
'Cause this could turn out to be love we're makin'

I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally
There's a time to be wild
There's a time to be free
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally

I've been looking for you
I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me
You've been looking for me

Baby, set your love free
Set your love free
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally

I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally
There's a time to be wild
There's a time to be free
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally

I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally
There's a time to be wild
There's a time to be free
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally
