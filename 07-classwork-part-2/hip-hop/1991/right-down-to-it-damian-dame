Mmm.....

Baby, if I drive you crazy
Ain't nothing personal about it
Girl, I'm just that way
See, baby, sometimes I'm shaky
But don't confuse it
Don't you lose it
Cause it be that way

Oh, here lately
I've been thinking
Just a thinking
Thinking what you think of your guy

Somebody's telling you
I don't care about you
Ain't a single word about it true

Cause when it gets right down to it
I'm in love with you
And baby, you should
You should know it by now

When it gets right down to it
I wanna get with you
And, girl, I need
Your loving right now

Frankly I'm not that crazy
I know a good thing when I got it
And I do give a damn

Lady, don't let em play me
Let it go through one ear
Out the other, baby
Stand by your man

Oh, baby
Don't you be influenced
By your girlfriends jocking me on the side
Well, they just know it's good
They want a piece of it
Snatch me at the bat of an eye
When it gets right down

When it gets right down to it
I'm in love with you
Baby, you should know it by now, whoa

When you love what you touch
And you touch what you want
Then you want what you kiss

When you diss what you want
