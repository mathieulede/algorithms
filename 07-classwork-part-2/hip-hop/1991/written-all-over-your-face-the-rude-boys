[Hook]
It's written all over your face
You don't have to say a word
Just smile, a smile, a smile, a smile for me
Is better than any word I ever heard

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm a very lucky guy
To have someone like you
I never met a girl in my life like you before
You make all my dreams come true
I love the way you carry you [?]
You have a lot of class and good taste
And you don't have to say how much you care for me
Because it's written all over your face
Don't you know

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You dont have to say how much you love me, girl
Because you show me every day
You kiss me, you miss me, you hold me very tight
You love me in every way
I love the way you carry you
You got a lotta class and good taste
And you dont have to say how much you care for me
Because it's written all over, written all over your, your, your face, baby

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Going to the bridge
It's written on your face
That you really care
It's written on your face
That you really care

[Hook x3]
