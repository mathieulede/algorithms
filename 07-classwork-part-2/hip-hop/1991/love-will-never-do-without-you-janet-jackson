[Verse 1]
Our friends think we're opposites
Falling in and out of love
They all said we'd never last
Still we manage to stay together

[Verse 2]
There's no easy explanation for it
But whenever there's a problem
We always work it out somehow
Work it out somehow

[Chorus]
They said, it wouldn't last
We had to prove them wrong
Cause I've learned in the past
That love will never do without you

[Verse 3]
Other guys have tried before
To replace you as my lover
Never did I have a doubt
Boy it's you, I can't do without

[Verse 4]
I feel better when I have you near me
Cause no other love around
Has quite the same, ooh ooh
Like you do, do, do, do babe

[Chorus]
