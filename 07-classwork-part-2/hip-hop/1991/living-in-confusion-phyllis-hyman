[Verse 1]
I believed in you
I thought you could do no wrong
Until I saw one day
That you were stringing me along
Played me for a fool
You used me once too much
I'm in so much pain
Here I am again
Trust is a hard thing
To come by these days
You build me up
To let down
Got me spinning around
I wish I knew
Where you were coming from
You told me you loved me
I thought I was your only one

[Hook]
Seems like I'm always going through changes
Living in confusion!
Confusion, confusion

Seems like I'm always going through changes
Living in confusion
Confusiooonnnnn!


[Verse 2]
I had faith in you
Just knew you wouldn't hurt me
But you played a game
You should be ashamed
I let my gaurd down
I was so vunerable
I hope you had your fun
Don't you know I was loyal to you

Truth is a hard thing
To come by these days
You build me up to break me down
Got me spinning around
I wish I knew where you were coming from
You told me you loved me
I thought I was only one

[Hook]
Seems like I'm always going through changes
Living in confusion
Confusion, Confusion


Seems like I'm always going through changes
Living in confusion
Confusionnnn

[Verse 3]
I deserve better
I'm not gonna take no more
You build me up to let me down
Got me spinning around
I'm gonna find
Find me somebody new
A love I can count on
Loving you see it ain't you
Oh


[Hook Once Again]
Seems like I'm always going through changes
Living in confusion
Confusion, confusion
Seems like I'm always going through changes
Living in confusion
(Confusion)
