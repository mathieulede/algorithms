Come on y'all
I think the time is right
So let's get down with the groove
The music's out of sight

What it is, everybody
You hear where I'm comin' from
This feelin' hit me by surprise
I'm ready to have some fun

This feelin' hit me
Hit me before I knew it
Now I got myself together
There really ain't nothin' to it

I feel alright y'all
I feel like dynamite
I feel alright y'all
I feel like dynamite

Watch me y'all
Ain't jokin'
Watch me y'all
I'm smokin'

I can do anything I want to do - betcha
You can do anything you want to do - betcha
You might not agree with me
I think I'm outta sight
When I get to doin' my thing
I feel like dynamite

This feelin' hit me
Hit me before I knew it
Now I got myself together
There really ain't nothin' to it

I feel alright y'all
I feel like dynamite
I feel alright y'all
I feel like dynamite

I feel alright y'all
I feel like dynamite
I feel alright y'all
I feel like dynamite
