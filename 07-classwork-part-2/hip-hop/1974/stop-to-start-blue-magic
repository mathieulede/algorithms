Ba, ba, da, ba, ba, da, ba, ba, da, ba, ba, da, da
I just don't want to be lonely

I don't mind when you say that you're goin' away
I just don't want to be lonely
And I don't care of you share only moments a day
I just don't want to be lonely
(Just don't want to be lonely)

I'd rather be loved, needed
Depended on to give the love I can't give
When you're gone, when you're gone
I just don't want to be lonely
(Just don't want to be lonely)

I don't mind when the tide sets the sun to the moon
I just don't want to be lonely
Let the stairs find you there at the end of the room
I just don't want to be lonely
(Just don't want to be lonely)

I'd rather be loved, needed
Depended on to give the love I can't give
When you're gone, when you're gone
I just don't want to be lonely

Take my hand, I'm dependin' on you
To love me, to hold me
Just to meet me and to give me all your love
Because, baby, I just, I just don't want to be lonely

Ba, ba, da, ba, ba, da, ba, ba, da, ba, ba, da, da
I just don't want to be lonely
Ba, ba, da, ba, ba, da, ba, ba, da, ba, ba, da, da
I just don't want to be lonely
I just don't want to be lonely

I'd rather be loved, needed
Depended on to give the love I can't give
When you're gone, when you're gone
I just don't want to be lonely

I'd rather be loved, needed
Depended on to give the love I can't give
When you're gone
(When you're gone)
I just don't want to be lonely

(I'd rather be loved, needed)
(Depended on to give the love I can't give)
(When you,re gone, when you,re gone)
I just don't want to be lonely

I'd rather be loved, needed
Depended on to give the love I can't give
When you're gone, when you're gone
I just don't want to be lonely
(Just don't want to be lonely)

I'd rather be loved, needed
Depended on to give the love I can't give
When you're gone
I just don't want to be lonely
(Just don't want to be lonely)

I'd rather be loved
(Needed)
I'd rather be
(Depended on to give the love I can't give)
Just to have that special someone
(When you're gone)

Right by my side
(When you're gone)
It may be all just a dream
(I just don't want to be lonely)
But one day

(I'd rather be loved)
Shell come along
(Needed)
(Depended on to give the love I can't give)

And when she does
I'll wait for her with all my joy
(When you're gone)
I will give her all the love

(When you're gone)
So wherever you are
(I just don't want to be lonely)
I just wanna say these words

I just wanna be loved
I just wanna be needed, mmm
When you're gone, when you're gonna
I just don't want to be lonely

I'd rather be loved, needed
Depended on to give the love I can't give
When you're gone
