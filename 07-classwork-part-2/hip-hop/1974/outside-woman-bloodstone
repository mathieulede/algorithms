'Cause you're the outside woman
Don't feel bad, don't cry

I lay next to another woman
But I call out your name
(Calling, calling, calling your name)
Yeah babe

And I really want to see you right now
But right now I can't change a thing
(Can't change a thing, can't change a thing)

But just remember, girl, I love you
And as soon as I can I'll break away
And see you, baby
(Don't feel bad)

Sometimes it seems
A million years between
Our little get-together
Oh, yeah, yeah

But I know that you know that I know
That you think things ain't gonna get any better
(Get any better, get any better)

But just remember, girl, I love you
And as soon as I can I'll break away
And see you, baby
(Don't feel bad)

'Cause you're the outside woman
Don't feel bad
(Don't feel bad)

You know that I belong to another
Oh girl, oh girl, yeah
You're supposed to understand
Just how I feel, whoa, oh

Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, I'll be there
To kiss your little tears away
Yeah baby, yeah

Just hold on
(Just hold on)
Just hold on
(Just hold on)
Just hold on
(Don't feel bad)

Just hold on
(Just hold on)
Just hold on
(Just hold on)
Just hold on
(Don't feel bad)

Inside, outside
Inside, outside woman
Inside, outside
Inside, outside woman

'Cause you're the outside woman
Don't feel bad
