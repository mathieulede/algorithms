Turn the lights down low
Baby come close
Put your hand in mine
Oh please be kind

Let me touch your heart
Let the fire start
Ooo so warm, so warm

Soft music plays
Please sit down and stay
Put your trust in me
Let this love be

This is for real
Let time stand still
Ooo so warm, so warm

Turn the lights down low
Baby come close
Ooo so warm, so warm
So warm, so warm

Ooo turn the lights down low
Baby come close
Let dreams come true
For me and you

We won't regret
We won't forget
Ooo so warm, so warm, yeah yeah
So warm, so warm
So warm

Turn the lights down low
Baby come close
