Hey girl
What is your name?
I wanna talk to you
If I can, I can, I can, I can

All day, I've watched you pass me by
I wanted to stop you but I didn't know how
What would I say or what would I do
If I had my chance to get close to you?

Hey girl, (hey girl)
What is your name?
I wanna talk to you
If I can, I can, I can, I can

Just give me a minute
Of your precious time
I've got something to say
That's been on my mind
Lets start with
First thing's first
I dont want to play games
I simply want to ask a question
Tell me what is your name?

Hey girl
What is your name?
I wanna talk to you
If I can, I can, I can, I can

Each day, I watch you come and go
You never smile
You never say hello
But in my heart I knew I had to
Get close to you
I always knew, I had to get close
To you, to you, to you, to you

Hey girl, (hey girl)
Tell me (what is your name)
I've gotta know
I wanna talk to you, if I can
