[Verse 1]
Don't knock my love
Don't hold you up
And my kisses don't set your stuff
Don't be afraid, to let me know
There's other places woman, that I can go

[Chorus]
If you don't like it (don't like it)
Don't knock it, (don't knock it)
Somebody else (somebody) might want to rock it
If you don't need it (don't need it)
Don't waste it (don't waste it)
Somebody else (somebody) might want to taste it

[Verse 2]
If my thrill, don't turn you on
And my will baby, is much to strong
Don't waste my time with your foolish ways
I got other things to do with my days

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Going up, going down, going all way around town
I'm the one, that turn you on
I'm the same one to leave you alone
Don't knock my love, don't knock my love
Don't knock my love
