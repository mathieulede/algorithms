We can make it, baby
If we only try
Don't let our love die
Don't let our love die

I know we can make it, baby
If only we try
Let's hang on to love
And don't let it die
(Don't let it die)

Even though
It's been touch and go
Off and on we've been strong
But then we didn't know
That with hope we could cope
With all the ups and downs
So please stay around

I need you so
Oh, girl, I need you so
(I need you)

I'd give you a bed of roses
Right here in my arms
But you've got to take
The sweet with the thorns
And I know

It's been touch and go
Off and on, we've been strong
But then we didn't know
That with hope we could cope
With all the ups and downs
So please stay around

I need you so
Ooh, girl, I need you so
(I need you)

There's nothing to lose by trying
And so much to gain
As long as the sunshine
Follows the rain

Love will grow
You gotta know

Oh, it's been touch and go
Off and on, we've been strong
But then we didn't know
That with hope we could cope
With all the ups and downs
So please stay around

I need you so
Ooh, girl, I need you so
(I need you)

It's been touch and go
Off and on, we've been strong
But then we didn't know
That with hope we could cope
With all the ups and downs
So please stay around

I need you so
Ooh, girl, I need you so
(I need you)

It's been touch and go
Off and on, we've been strong
But then we didn't know....
