Girl, you know you won't give me no more

Packin' up my clothes

(Than need and don't have)

(Pain and sorrow)

Yea-hey-hey

My-my-my-my, clouds so dark
Have lost their silver linin'
But don't throw away
Your umbrella, ya'all
('Cause your sun is shining)

Oh, Lord!
I remember when your love, baby used to
(Keep me humming)
But I like the lyrics to your song
But I just can't feel
(Feel the music)
Oh!
