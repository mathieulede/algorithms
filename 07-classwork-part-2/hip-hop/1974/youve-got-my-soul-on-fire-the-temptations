Baby, you better quit, umm

Well, keep on doin' whatcha doin', yeah
Feels so good to me, girl
Keep on doin' whatcha doin', lady
Ohh, you feel so good to me

Girl, I went to see my doctor and he told me
Well, from your lovin' I've got to stay away
He told me to let you go for my heart can't stand much mo'
And there oughta be a law against lovin' a man this way

Aww, but I can't get enough of your lovin', no, Lord
And my need keeps getting stronger everyday
Girl, I've got just one life to live and a lotta love to give and give
And let it be known that I ain't ashamed to say

You've got my soul on fire
(On fire)
Don't you ever stop it, baby, what you doin' to me
Girl, now you've got my soul on fire
(On fire)
Oh, yeah, baby, baby
I like it, like it, like it, baby, like it, hey, girl

When it comes to lovin', you're one of a kind
Satisfaction guaranteed, every doggone time, whoa, baby
You ain't got to worry about me ever leaving you
'Cause they ain't made a woman yet that can do the things you do
Oh, oh

When you press your sweet lips to mine, whoo, baby
My blood starts boiling and my temperature starts to rise
Girl, I shudder, baby, and I ain't ashamed to admit it
And even if it kills me, girl, I don't want you to quit it

You've got my soul on fire, oh, yeah
(On fire)
Baby, I like it, I like it, like it, like it
You've got my soul on fire
(On fire)
Ho, fire, aw, baby
I like it, like it, like it, like it, like it, baby, oh, baby

Eww, eww, whoo, whoo, whoo, Umm, umm, umm
Don't stop, Lord, don't stop, I like it
Eww, eww, eww, eww, eww, ohh, baby

When you put your loving arms around me
Girl, my mind, body and soul you control
(You control)
I'm your puppet on a string, hey, and one more thing
Woman, your love is too hot to hold

You've got my my soul on fire
(On fire)
Oh, baby, baby, I like it, like it, like it, like it
You've got my soul on fire
(On fire)
Oh, yeah, heh, heh, my baby

Hey, don't you ever stop it, baby, don't you stop it
Baby, now you've got my soul on fire
(On fire)
Oh, yeah

Baby, oh, baby
Don't you stop it, baby
