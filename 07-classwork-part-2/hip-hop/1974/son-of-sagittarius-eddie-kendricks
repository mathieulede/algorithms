People, I am the fire number nine Zodiac sign
Jupiter brings me the power, Saturn brings me a piece of mind
I must be clear there's no use of trying to change me
In Lady Luck I put my trust

I'm the son of a
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the son of a Sagittarius

Pretty girls of my desire but with love I play no games
Aries women set me on fire, Leo lovers stomp my flames
I'm a right doing guy, yeah, but sometimes I backslide
The devil makes me act up

This is the son of a
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the son of a Sagittarius

I'm Sagittarius
I'm Sagittarius
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I'm the son of a
I'm the one, I'm the one
I'm the son of a
Hey, people, I'm the fire
Jupiter brings me the power

Sagittarius, Sagittarius, Sagittarius
