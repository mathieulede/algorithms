I see you every day
When you walk by this way
You go into the house next door
Stay an hour or so

Oh, I don't know
Who you're going to see
But I wish it was me you loved

Who is sharing some of your time
Oh, love
Who could call you mine, all mine
Oh, love
I said I wish it was you loved

Oh, I saw him today
For the very first time
And when you put your arms around him
Ooh, baby, I almost went out of my mind

Cause with him, you seem so happy
Ooh, how I wished it was me

Who was making you laugh that way
Oh, love
Who was hearing those
Sweet words you had to say
Oh, love

When I saw you kiss him
Ooh, it made me feel so sad
My heart cried out in my pain, love
Oh, baby, because it hurt me so bad

But all I could do was stand there
And wish, wish it was me, love
I said I wish it was me you loved

All I could was stand there and cry
And wish it was me you loved
I said I wish it was me you loved
