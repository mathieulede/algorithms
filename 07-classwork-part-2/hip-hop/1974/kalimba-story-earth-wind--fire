Saw it in a store one day
Thought it might make me play
Future music all for you

Seen me through my hardest time
Thought it was 'bout time
To open up a new world just for you

Fills all my needs, gave me the key
Door was open for me to see
Playin' around the world
Touchin' all the boys and girls
With a new love to make them free

Kalimba, ooh, kalimba
Play me a tune
Kalimba, ooh, kalimba
Hey, I'm glad I found you
Kalimba, ooh, kalimba
Play me a tune
Kalimba, ooh, kalimba
Sings a message to you

If you lend an ear
And you have no fear
The vibration will move your mind
It's new to you, sounds true to you
Sacred music before its time

Play it for you now
Wanna see just how
My kalimba get next to you
Are you ready now
Well, get ready now
Come along, groove with the new, hey

Kalimba, ooh, kalimba
Play me a tune
Kalimba, ooh, kalimba
I'm glad I found you
Kalimba, ooh, kalimba
Play me a tune
Kalimba, ooh, kalimba
Sings a message to you

Kalimba, kalimba
Play me a tune
Kalimba, kalimba
Sings a message to you

Kalimba, kalimba
Sings a message to you
