"EVIL DICTATORS" by T.U.T (The Undisputed Truth)

HOOK:
This is my world this is where I am living
You can cage me or kill me I die not sinning
Look at the world see what we were given
Prison conditions we livin' held back from our limits
This is my world this is where I am living
You can cage me or kill me I die not sinning
Look at the world see what we were given
How longs it gone take, pick up the suspicion

Verse 1 (Gaddafi)-

I have a dream from a foreign land, resource rich and unite we stand
They claim I'm bad and the people all sad
With the Healthcare, education and all of that
Free housing for all enjoy your flat
Respect for women, we all for that
Even start to plan for our own bank
Stability finally wether black or tanned
Water system flowing straight through africa
Bombs drop system stop then they laugh at ya
Start to trade oil into Asia
The world bank IMF they ain't playin ya
Adolfs face placed next to yours
Spirits free but Americas poor
So they say liberation and then they send war
Kill my child take my life and my country no more

HOOK:

Sadaam-
Cities burnt down, they safari club extremists
Freedom of the press, it don't exist
The region was stable with no CIA
Now you Blown away for praying the wrong way
They say they care and it ain't about wealth
Sadaam support you kept on stealth
And All the chemical weapons you sold as well
You watch people die, no stories are news
You trust Israel they've seen the nukes
Like every arab posed a threat to jews
Steal our wealth treat us as fools
But We Devils now we won't bow to you
Like Saudi Arabia other gulf states do
Sanctions, war Iran
Then your Bombs would land
You gonna see your souls are doomed that's worse than the noose
And The wrath of millions bout to let all loose

HOOK:

Assad-

Funding al-Qaeda and drones in the sky
You don't care for Syrians
You fund both sides
Watch Hillary laugh as children die
It's like for muslims you don't care
Can watch it live
Half a million civilians
Man they like killing our children
How many thousands more gotta
Die in these buildings
Could you blame Baron in Surinam
Like you blamed 9/11 on Afghans
Man I just can't stand
What you done to this land
Christians could walk the streets with a beer in hand
Now death discrimination like Ku Klux Klan
Balkanizing the region that's all your plan
Take out Assad then move to Iran
Israel USA I'm calling you out
You fund and create terrorists
And help them out so the Yinon plan
Will come about

HOOK:
This is my world this is where I am living
You can cage me or kill me I die not sinning
Look at the world see what we were given
Prison conditions we livin' held back from our limits

How longs it gone take, pick up the suspicion


For the lost children of Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Palestine, Yemen and all the effected by Israeli and western terrorism RIP
