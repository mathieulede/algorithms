You've got what I like, baby
You know I'm crazy about you
Give it up so I can get it right, now
Don't let me walk away without it, hey hey
* I'm choosing up on you, baby
* You're the only one for me it's true
* I'm choosing up on you, baby
I've got many fine girls to choose from
Up and them I shall refrain
If you would only surrender your love to me, baby
Don't let me walk away in vain
* Refrain I...

My first, last and only choice is you
** I'll never make you blue
** I'll always treat you right
** Give all my sweet love to you, baby
** And each and every night
* Refrain I...
I can get a thrill any where I can get a thrill
But when it comes to satisfaction, hey, baby
Yo'ure the star of the show
You're the main attraction
** Refrain II...
* Refrain I...
