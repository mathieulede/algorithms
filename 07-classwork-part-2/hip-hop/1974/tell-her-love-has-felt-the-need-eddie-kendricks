Aw, in the morning when she wakes
Light of dawn come touch her face
Sunshine keep her warm and safe
Wind come blow her tears away

Tell her love has felt the need to leave her
Tell her love has felt the need to free her
I could never be what she wants of me, yeah-eah

Diamond rings and wedding plans
Children laughing and holding hands
She deserves that kind of man
But my life is like a ship in sand, yeah

Tell her love has felt the need to leave her
Tell her love has felt the need to free her
I could never be what she wants of me

Love her, ooo-ooo-ooo
I could never be what she wants of me
Yeah, yeah-eah-eah
I could never be what she wants of me

Tell her love has felt the need to leave her
Tell her love has felt the need to free her
Huh-huh-huh
(Won't you tell her)
Huh-huh
I could never be what she wants of me, yeah

I could never be what she wants of me
(Won't you tell her)
Hey

I'll just pass her by, I don't want to make her cry
(Won't you tell her)
Hey

Hope she finds a happy home, I think it's best that I move on
(Hey)
Hey

I could never be what she wants of me
(Hey)
Hey-ey
