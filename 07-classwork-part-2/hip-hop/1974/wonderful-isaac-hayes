It's wonderful to be in love with you
It's so nice to know that you love me too

It seems like heaven is smiling at me
The first time I saw your face
This hunger started growing in me
And those lips of yours, I just had to taste

Now that was the birth of our love affair
And since then it's grown a thousand times
You're the sweetest thing that love can bring
And I'm so glad that you're mine

And it's wonderful to be in love with you, oh, yes it is
It's so nice to know that you love me too

No one in this world is perfect
But you're the closest to perfection as one can be
You are my inspiration
You're the other half that makes the whole of me

Compliments to you from all the people who know
Is how you brighten up my world
And you keep it bright, every day and night
You are just quite a girl

It's wonderful to be in love with you, oh, yes, it is, yes, it is
It's so nice to know that you love me too

Baby, ooh baby, I wouldn't leave you if I could
Mama, ooh mama, your love is so doggone good, so good
And everyday is gonna be that way
Just as long as I'm your man

It's wonderful to be in love with you, yes it is
I said that it's so nice to know that you love me too
