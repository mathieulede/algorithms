There's too many people
Tellin' too many lies
I'm gonna have to build them
A city in the sky
Where I can fly away, yeah

A city so high
Won't have it no other way, no
I sure ain't gonna miss
The city I leave behind
Drag out the drag
It's blowin' my mind away

There's been too many children
With tears in their eyes
We're gonna build them
A city in the sky
Where they can fly away

A city so high
Won't have it no other way
They sure ain't gonna miss
The city they leave behind
Drag out the drag
It's blowin' their minds away

It's been quite a fine morning
It's been quite a fine day
What a feelin' just knowin'
I won't have find a way, no
To California, hmm, tomorrow morning, oh
I just don't believe L.A., no
I'm gonna miss the city
I leave behind
Drag out the drag
It's blowin' my mind away, y'all

Good idea
Gotta get away
I wonder what it is
That somethin' make me
Wanna fly away
Fly, fly away
Just make me fly away

Fly, fly away
I'll fly away
Fly, fly away
I'll fly away
I'll fly away
Fly, fly away
I'll fly away
I'll fly away
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
I wanna fly away
I wanna fly away
To the city in the sky
