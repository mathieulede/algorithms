[Intro]
Everybody's got a thing
But some don't know how to handle it
Always reaching out in vain
Accepting the things not worth having but

[Chorus 1]
Don't you worry about a thing
Don't you worry about a thing, mama
Because I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out

[Verse 1]
They say your style of life's a drag
And that you must go other places
But just don't you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces but

[Bridge]
Don't you worry about a thing
Don't you worry about a thing, mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
When you get it off your trip
Don't you worry about a thing, yeah
Don't you worry about a thing, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Don't you worry about a thing
Don't you worry about a thing, mama
Because I'll be standing on the side
When you check it out
When you get it off your trip

[Verse 2]
Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through

[Chorus 3]
Don't you worry about a thing
Don't you worry about a thing, pretty mama
Because I'll be standing in the wings
When you check it out

[Outro]
Don't you worry about a thing
