Mmm, that's the sound
That lonely makes
Oh, that's the sound
My heart can't take
Streets deserted
Only emptiness and me
Walk side by side
Down the road to destiny
Time for dreaming
(Time for dreaming)
'Cause reality makes me cry
I'm left with memories
(Left with memories)
Of a love saying goodbye
Oh, clocks keep a-ticking
But time will stop for me
I've lost the beat of life
With the start of misery
Oh, that's the sound, yeah
That lonely makes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, that's the sound
(That's the sound, yeah)
My heart can't take, mmm
That's the sound
(That's the sound, oh, baby)
That lonely makes
Yeah, yeah
That's the sound
My heart can't take, oh
Sometimes at night
I hear crying in my sleep
(I hear crying in my sleep)
And I wake up (and I wake up)
And find out it was me
Conversations (conversations)
With walla that echo back
The noisy silence
(The noisy silence)
That shows her where I'm at
Oh, I search for answers
So, tell me why am I
Could a love going so strong
Be a nightmare now
Oh, that's the sound (yeah(
That lonely makes
(That's the sound, baby)
Woo hoo, that's the sound
(That's the sound)
My heart can't take
That's the sound
(That's the sound)
That lonely makes
(That's the sound, baby)
That's the sound, yeah
My heart can't take
Do do do do...
Oh, a time for dreaming
'Cause reality makes me cry
I'm left with memories
Of a love saying goodbye
Oh, that's the sound
(That's the sound)
That lonely makes (baby)
(That's the sound)
That's the sound
My heart can't take, yeah
That's the sound
(Emptiness in me, baby)
That lonely makes
(It's all memories)
That's the sound
(That's the sound)
That's the sound
My heart can't take
Oh, that's the sound
That lonely makes, baby
(Oh, baby)
That's the sound
(That's the sound, yeah, yeah)
My heart can't take
