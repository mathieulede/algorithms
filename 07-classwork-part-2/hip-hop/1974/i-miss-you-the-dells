Woke up this mornin'
Sunlight shinin' in my eyes
Woke up this mornin'
And I cried, Lord I cried all night

Pillow's drippin', soakin' wet
From dreams of you, baby
And tryin' hard to forget
But what's the use, I'm hooked on you

And I miss you, baby
With all my heart and soul
I, I, I miss you, baby and I need you too

Day in and day out
I do nothin' but miss her in my life
Tryin' to find a replacement
For the love you could only provide

What am I gonna do, who's gonna love me?
If you don't love me like you say you'll do
Baby, why couldn't you be true?
'Cause I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby

You're breakin' my heart
You're tearin' it apart
What am I gonna do?
I need your lovin' and your kisses too

I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby
I, I miss you, baby, girl, what am I gonna do?
I ain't got you, you know I miss you, baby
I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby

You can see it all in my walk
You can tell by the way I talk
I miss you, baby, no sense denyin'
I miss you, baby, I miss you, baby

I'll tell the whole wide world
I can't live without you, I miss you, baby
No matter who you're with tonight
If you come back, I'll treat you right

I said I miss you, baby
I miss you, baby, longin' for you
