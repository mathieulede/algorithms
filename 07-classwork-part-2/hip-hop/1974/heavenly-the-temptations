Laaalaaala la la

So you're through with love
Any you say
It's just a waste of time

Waste of time you blew my mind

There are two sides to love
And if you will
I'd like to show you mine
Girl love has it's ups and downs
Sometimes like a merry go round, going round and around and around and around
Never knowing where you're bound

I may not be the one you want
But I'm sure the one you need

Give me a chance to prove
Love shared by me and you can be

Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly

That's how

That's how love is when it's right it's right

Simply

Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly

That's how

That's how love is when it's right

Hey girl, be fair to your heart
Don't turn your back on love

(back on love)
No, no, cuz love is the one thing everybody needs
(everybody needs love)
Hey girl, open up your heart again, please won't you let me in, give me a chance to undo, all the hurt he's put you through

I may not be the one you want, but I'm sure the one you need

Girl give me a chance and you'll see, sharing your love with me will be

Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly

That's how (how)

That's how love is when it's right

Simply

Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly

That's how

That's how love is when it's right

Hey girl, give love another try

Ooooh, love can pass you by

Love can be

Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly

I know, I know it's gonna be

Heavenly

Love can be, love can be (aaah aah ah aaah)
