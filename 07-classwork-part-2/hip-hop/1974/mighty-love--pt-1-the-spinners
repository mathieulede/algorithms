Once there was a boy and girl
Boys said, "I love you so"
Girl said, "I'll never leave you"
They grew older and left each other
Cause that's the way love goes
That's the way love goes

Then there's a time
Seems like you'll never find
Someone willing to love you
Keep on lookin', you'll soon discover

A mighty love
Will sometimes makes you weep and moan
A mighty love
You sit all day by the telephone
Cause you're all alone
You need a mighty love, eh, hey

Some say that you're sure to find
True love and peace of mind
At the end of a rainbow
There's no sign in the sky to follow
Cause that's the way love goes
Baby, that's the way love goes

And so there's a rhyme
That says life will soon be fine
Love is just what you make it
So keep on lovin, you'll soon discover

A mighty love
Will sometimes make a-a weak man strong
A mighty love
Will sometimes make a-a rich man weak
And knock him off his feet
You'll have a mighty love
Mighty, mighty, mighty
Mighty, mighty, mighty love Jones
Comin' down on me, baby, yeah

Hey, hey (Mighty love)
I can feel the world gettin' brighter
Brighter with your lovin'
(Mighty love) You see, baby
With a mighty love you can sometimes turn the world around
(Mighty love) From all your love
You can, you can turn the world around
Sometimes, yes, you can, oh
(Mighty love) Oh, baby
Makes music have a happy, ha-ha-happy sigh
(Mighty love) Makes you move, makes you groove
You get the feelin' that is reelin', come on
(Mighty love) Oh...high, high, high
I'm gon', gon', gon', gon', gon' get your lovin'
(Mighty love) Oh, baby, oh, ho, ho, got your love
(Mighty love) Got your love, got your lovin', oh

(Mighty love) You got the love, hey, baby
(Mighty love) I-I knew when I first met you
That you had a mighty love, baby

Gonna wait on you, baby, just give me
(Mighty love) Give, give, give, give, give, give, give me your love
(Mighty love) Mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty, mighty
