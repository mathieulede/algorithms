Verse 1 (spoken)
You know its said that into each life, some rain must fall
But behind every dark cloud, the sun will shine
I want to take a little time out to explain to you what I mean
You see, you dont know how good it is to get over, If youve never been under
You dont know how it feels to be up, If youve never been down
You dont know how good it is to have peace of mind, If youve never had to worry
You see you just dont realize what it is to be happy, If youve never been sad
Let me tell you why
Chorus
Its got to be rain in your life
To appreciate the sunshine
Its got to be rain in your life
To appreciate the sunshine
Verse 2
When trouble comes, Thats rain
When youre sad, Rain
When the tears are falling down, Thats rain
When death come calling, It aint nothing but rain
You dont know what it is to wear a smile
(If youve never wore a frown)
You dont know what it is to be free, yall
(If youve never been bound)
Chorus
