I'll be the other woman
All your life
Just as long as I am the only one
Other than your wife

Your wife, how would she feel
If she caught us together
The same way I would feel
If I caught you with another

Home I know comes first
And second to that I'll be
When you're not there with her
I want you right here with me

I'll be the other woman
Just as long as I know
I'm the only other woman
You make love to

I'll be the other woman
But I've got to know
I'm the only other woman
You make love to

The neighbors are whispering
Saying you don't care
If you cheat on your wife for me
You'll cheat on me for someone else

I'll be your part time love
But that's as far as I'll go
To be your part time fool
Would be stooping a little too low

Loving a married man
This I really don't mind
But a married Casanova
Is a little out of my line

I'll be the other woman
Just as long as I know
I'm the only other woman
You make love to

I'll be the other woman
Long as I know
I'm the only other woman
You make love to

I'll open doors for you baby
Long as I know
I'm the only other woman
You make love to

I'll be your part time love
I've got to know
I'm the only other woman
You make love to

Oh, yes I will
Yes, I will
Oh yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
