Can't you feel it in your bones?
Oh, a change is comin' on
From every walk of life
People are seeing the light

Can't you feel it in your heart now?
A new thing is taking shape
Reach out, touch a hand
Lord, make a friend if you can

Hey, what about you my friend?
Anytime you come on in
Live the united way
Why don't you join us today?

Reach out, touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
Reach out, touch a hand
Make a friend if you can

Ooh, it's been reflecting in the attitudes
Of others just like you
Reach out, touch a hand
Yo, make a friend if you can

Every day folk are waking up
To the need for one another
We're on our way
Making the world a better place

Can't you feel it in your heart now?
A new thing is taking shape
Reach out, touch a hand
Yo, make a friend if you can

Reach out, touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
Reach out, touch a hand
Make a friend if you can

Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can

Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can

Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can

Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
Reach out and touch a hand
Make a friend if you can
