Everybody's high on consolation
Everybody's trying to tell me what is right for me
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now it's up to me, woo, what will be

She's gone oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd better learn how to face it
She's gone oh I, oh I'd
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, oh I, what went wrong

Get up in the morning look in the mirror
I'm worn as her tooth brush hanging in the stand
My face ain't looking any younger
Now I can see love's taken her dirty toll on me

She's gone, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd better learn how to face it
She's gone oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, oh I, what went wrong

Think I'll spend eternity in the city
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away
Pretty bodies help dissolve the memories
They can never be what she was to me

She's gone, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd better learn how to face it
She's gone, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, oh I, what went wrong
I'm talkin' to myself

She's gone, oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd better learn how to face it
She's gone oh I, oh I, oh I
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, oh I, what went wrong
