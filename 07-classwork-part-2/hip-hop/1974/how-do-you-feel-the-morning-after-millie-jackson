You've given me things
That mean a lot
A love I could endure
You've given me
A home, a family
Made me feel secure

Yet all that you give
There's a question
That needs an answer
How can you give
Your love to another
Come home and face me
The morning after

How do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
After you've given your
Love to someone new

Tell me now
How do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
I lay here all night long
Waiting on you

I know, I know, I know
You must be dying inside
If you tell me
You'll be confessing
So you can't apologize

Ooh, it hurts me so
To know that I'm
The one to suffer
To know that I
Must be second best
When the best has
Gone to another

How do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
After you've given your
Love to someone new

Tell me now
How do you feel (How do you feel)
The morning after (How do you feel)
After I lay here all night long
Waiting on you

Did she make you wanna cry
The morning after
After you've given your
Love to someone else

Tell me now
How do you feel
The morning after
After I lay here all night long
Waiting on you

Oh, baby
How do you feel
The morning after
After I lay here all night long
Waiting on you

How do you feel
The morning after
After you've given your
Love away to someone new...
