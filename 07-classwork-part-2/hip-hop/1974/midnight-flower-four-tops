Midnight flower
You got the power
Let me buy the things you do, darlin'
For just one hour

You may never
Fall in love with me
But it don't matter
As long as you and I, darling
Can get together

I don't care
What people say you are
'Cause in my eyes, girl
You are a superstar

The way you move
Is like sweet music flowin'
And inside of me
There is a need that's growin'

No price is too high
Midnight flower
You got the power
(Do something with me)
Let me buy the things you do, darlin'
For just one hour

You may never
Fall in love with me
But it don't matter
(Do something with me)
As long as you and I, darling
Can get together

I don't fool myself
It's one side romance
But I'd gladly pay the price
For just half a chance

It's wishful thinkin'
For just, oh, tonight
Let me pretend, baby
I'm your heart's delight

Oh, baby, hey
Midnight flower
You got the power
(Do something with me)
Let me buy the things you do, darlin'
For just one hour

I, I just gotta have ya
I need your company
To soothe this yearnin' in me

Girl, I, I just gotta have ya
Could be the devil's gotten me
But only you can set me free, yeah

Don't put on me, baby
Love me, girl
Pour it all over me, baby
Your sweet love
Oh, so sweet

Midnight flower
You got the power
(Do something with me)
Let me buy the things you do, darlin'
For just one hour

You may never
Fall in love with me
But it don't matter
(Do something with me)
As long as you and I, darling
Can get together
