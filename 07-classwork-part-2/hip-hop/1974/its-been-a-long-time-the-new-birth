Been such a long time, since I saw you
Tell me, girl, how long has it been
I'm so glad to see you 'cause I really love you
You were my only friend

You for me and me for you
Oh, listen, baby
You for me and me for you

It's been such a long time, girl, I still love you
I guess I always will
But in my silent nights, I long to hold you tight
It's you I really need

You for me and me for you
Listen baby
You for me and me for you
Yeah, yeah

Oh, no, no girl

I've been missin' you, baby
Yes, I have
Here's what you got to do
You got to do for me

You got to understand me
I got to understand you
You got to hang on in there
You got to hang on in there, baby

Understand me
And I will understand you
I need you, need you, need you
I need you, baby

Whenever I feel like this, baby
The only thing I can say to you
Ooh baby, ooh baby, yeah

'Cause it ain't no heart no [Incomprehensible] sometime
Oh, Lord, [Incomprehensible]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh baby, you know I love you

You've got to sit down
And make a little love to me, baby
You've got to understand me, baby
And I'll understand you

I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, baby
Let me say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hang on, hang on, hang on
It's been too long
Hang on, hang on, hang on
It's been too long

Hang on, hang on, hang on
It's been too long
Hang on, hang on, hang on
It's been too long

Give me a little love
'Cause I can't help myself
I said give me a little love
Baby, do a little love, oh, oh

Give me a little love
Love, baby, do it, baby, do it
Baby, do it, do it, do it, baby
Do it, do it, do it, baby
Do it, baby, do it, oh Lord
Do it, you know why
You know why, oh, oh, good
