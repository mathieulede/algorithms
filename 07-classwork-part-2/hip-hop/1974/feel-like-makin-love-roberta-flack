[Verse 1:]
Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Seein' lovers do their thing

[Chorus:]
Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
That's the time
I feel like makin' dreams come true
Oh, baby

[Verse 2:]
When you talk to me
When you're moanin' sweet and low
When you're touchin' me
And my feelings start to show

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
Hn a restaurant
Holdin' hands by candlelight
While I'm touchin' you
Wanting you with all my might

[Repeat Chorus:]

Strollin' in the park
Watchin' winter turn to spring
Walkin' in the dark
Seein' lovers do their thing

Oo-oo-ooh
That's the time
I feel like makin' love to you
