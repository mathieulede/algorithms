Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you I'll never know
You found a reason for leavin'
Soon as I gave my love to you

And oh...ah...whoa...the pain you put me through
You don't care 'bout my love for you, huh
But I found a reason for livin'
And I'm through with cryin' over you

And now I feel a song in my heart again
I knew as soon as I felt him lookin' through me
I feel a song in my heart again
High on the wings of the things he's doin' to me

Oh, that a man is fine
Ooh, what's even better the man is mine
He makes me feel just like a woman
Something that you could never do

And now I feel a song in my heart again
I found a man who can out it all together
I feel a song in my heart again
I'm gonna love him and make it last forever

Our worlds have come to an end

I feel a song in my heart again

Oh...oh...oh...it feels so good
You, you, you, you, you never understood
He makes me feel like I'm somethin'
And I'm gonna keep him if I can

I know I feel a song in my heart again
Now I can open my eyes to a new door
I feel a song in my heart again
The man is all that I need to fill my love up

I feel a song, ooh, what a feelin'
I feel it takin' me higher and higher
I feel a song in my heart again
His kind of lovin' I can never get enough of

I don't need your lovin' 'cause I got his lovin'
Woo, I feel a song again, ooh, y'all, I've been born again, ooh...
(I feel a song in my heart again)
(Feel it)

I feel a song in my heart again
I've got to tell you he's twice the man that you were
I feel a song in my heart again
