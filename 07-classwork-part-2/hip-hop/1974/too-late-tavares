Too late
Am I too late?
Too late
Am I too late?

Pain is my best friend
Makin' me think of you again
Wakin' me up and sayin'
"Fool, you've been careless and blind, unkind"

Tears I made you shed
(Look who's cryin')
Me, I made this bad
(No denyin')
I'm the man whose jones
Can't be brought into line

Am I too late to get in your door?
Am I too late? Have you locked the store?
Am I too late to sweep up the floor?
(Too late)
No, no, no, no

Eyes that could not see
(What you needed)
Arms that could not be
(What you wanted)
Lips that would not say
What you waited to hear, my dear

I'm the one to blame
(I admit it)
That and so ashamed
(That I did it)
Girl, I'm comin' home
It's you I wanna be near
(Hey, hey, hey)

Am I too late to get in your door?
Am I too late? Have you locked the store?
Am I too late to sweep up the floor?

Too late
Am I too late?
Too late
Am I too late?

Too late, too late
Too late, too late

Too late, can I get in your door?
Too late, wanna love you some more
Too late, can't you see that I'm here?
Too late, got us love that is real

Girl, I would do anything just for you
If you tell me it isn't too late

Am I too late to get in your door?
Am I too late? Have you locked the store?
Am I too late to sweep up the floor?

Girl, I would do anything just for you
If you tell me

Am I too late to get in your door?
Am I too late? Have you locked the store?
Am I too late to sweep up the floor?

Girl, I was wrong, this is where I belong
Am I too late to get in your door?
