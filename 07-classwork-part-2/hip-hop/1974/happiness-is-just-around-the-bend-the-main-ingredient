Say girl, you look a little restless
Well you ought to come with me `cause I`m going where the fun is
Don`t get lazy now, just a little bit up the road, just around the bend

There`s something going round inside my head
I think it`s something I need, Something unreal
And so I see my world is upside down
But there is nothing to fear
My vision is clear
All my roads lead nowhere
What lies at the end
Reach your destination
`cause what you find is your love bird
It`s your birth started again
So get up
Get it on
Try it again
Try it again girl
Get up
Happiness is just round the bend yeah
