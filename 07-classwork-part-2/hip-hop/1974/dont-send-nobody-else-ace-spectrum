Don't send me no postcards
Don't send me no letter
No, no, baby
Ain't nothing you can do now, girl
No
That'll make things any better
What I'm trying to say is

Baby, if you can't come yourself
No, no, girl
Oh, yeah
If you can't come yourself
No, girl
Don't send nobody else
No, baby
Come yourself, yeah

While you're out there having your fun, baby
Don't forget about number one, yeah
You see we're so connected, girl, yeah
I'm just about to feel neglected
What I'm trying to say is

Baby, if you can't come yourself
No, no, oh, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl
Don't send nobody else
No, no, baby
Come yourself

Cause I need you, girl
In the worst way
Don't think I can take it, girl
Another day
So now, baby
You made me do it
Now come and see to it
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Listen
Don't wanna be selfish, no, no
Or hold on too tight
But, honey, it's a struggle
Yeah, yeah
And I think I'm losing the fight
What I'm trying to say is

Baby, if you can't come yourself
No, no, oh, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl
Don't send nobody else
No, no, baby
Come yourself

Oooh, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl
Oh, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl
Don't send nobody else
No, no, baby
Come yourself

Oooh, baby, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl, oh, baby
If you can't come yourself
No, girl
Don't send me nobody else
No, no, baby
Come home yourself
