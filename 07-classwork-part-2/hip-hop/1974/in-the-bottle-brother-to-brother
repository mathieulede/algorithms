You see that black boy
Over there, running scared
His old man's in a bottle
He done quit his 9 to 5
He drink full time
And now he's living in the bottle
See that black boy
Over there, running scared
His old man got a problem
And it's a bad one
Pawned off damn near everything
His old woman's wedding ring
For a bottle
And don't you think it's a crime
When time after time after time
People in the bottle
There's people living in the bottle
Listen to me, see that sister
Sure was fine before
She started drinking wine
From the bottle
She told me
Her old man committed a crime
He's doing time
Now she's drinking in the bottle
I seen her out there on
The avenue, all by herself
Sure needs help from the bottle
I seen her, preacherman
Tried to help her out
She cussed him out and hit him
In the head with a bottle
And don't you think it's a crime
Knowing that time after time after time
People in the bottle, there's people
Sure enough in the bottle
Give you another good example
You see that gent in the wrinkled suit
He done damn near blown
His cool to the bottle
He was a doctor
Helping young girls along
If they wasn't too far
Gone to have problems
But the defenders of the dollar eagle
Said what you doing, man, ain't legal
Now he's in the bottle
Now we watch him everyday
He's trying to chase the
Pigeons away from the bottle
He turned to me, he said
Don't you think it's a crime
The way time after time
After time, friends of mine
In the bottle
There's people sure enough
In the bottle
I'll tell you a little secret
If you ever come looking for me
You know where I'm bound to be
In the bottle
Turn around, look around
On any corner, if you see
Some brother looking like a goner
It's gonna be me
Sing the song
Na na na na...
Dollar nine get a bottle of wine
Dollar nine get a bottle of wine
Dollar nine get a bottle of wine
Dollar nine get a bottle of wine
A bottle
All that I'm concerned about
Is a bottle
It can turn me inside out
A bottle
All I want, said all I want
Said all I want
Said all I want...
