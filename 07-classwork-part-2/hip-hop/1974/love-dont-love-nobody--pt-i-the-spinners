Sometimes a girl will come and go
You reach for love but life won't let cha know
That in the end, you'll still be lovin' her
But then she’s gone. You're all alone
I never learned, to give myself
I’ve been a fool, but right now I need someone else well well well
Just like boy blue I, I blow my horn if you
Just lead me home
Baby, I should have known

It takes a fool, to learn
That love don't love nobody
It takes a fool, to learn
That love don't love no one
It takes a fool (sometime’s ya gotta suffer) to lean
That love (make ya bed warm gotta sleep yeah well, well) don't love no one
It takes a fool (aww yes it does) to lean
That love don't love no one (no one, no one)
Sign of pain is on my face, well
My heartbeat stops
But I won't take the blame, no no
I gave her all the love, I had within
My love was strong
Somethin' went wrong, nooo
It takes a fool (yes, sir) to learn
That love don't love nobody
Love, love, love, love, love, love
It takes a fool to learn, yes it does, girl
That love don't love no one
That love don't love no one
It takes a fool to learn
Stop to think about it, well
That love don't love nobody, oh ohhh no
It takes a fool to learn
When you're down and out, shout about it
That love don't love no more
Tell the world, oooh weeee,ahhhhhh no more, ohh babe
It takes a fool to learn
Gotta be more careful about myself
That love don't love nobody
It takes a fool to learn
Woah baby, took me a long time to learn, to learn, well
That love don't love no one
It takes a fool to learn
I was a fool, you were a fool
That love don't love nobody
Now we got love, now we need lov’n
Ooh baby, ahh baby ahh baby I love you
It takes a fool to learn
That love don’t love nobody
Ah ha, whatcha say

Can we just talk for a minute?
You know ahh
Like I’ve always said, I’m not much of a rapper but
The truth I’ve learned from the time I was a child
You see I know from experience that
Baby you can’t color a fault. huh
And you sure can’t touch an emotion
Love, true love is to the bone
To the soul the hearts the home and uh
I just got to explain to you how I feel
Cause you see I’ve been a fool, but now I, now I love you and uh
It takes a fool
(I learned baby)
To learn (I learned) that love (well, well, well, well) don’t love nobody
It takes a fool to learn
(there’s been many who wanted to know)
That love don’t love no one (but ooh)
It takes a fool (oooh you helped me learn about it) to learn
(Now you know I gotta tell the world about it)
That love don’t love nobody
It takes a fool (awwo, ooh baby)
To learn (woo, la la laaa) That love don’t love nobody
It takes a fool (It takes a fool to learn) to learn (yes it does)
That love don’t love no body (baby, I need you)
It takes a fool (and I want cha) to learn
And Lord have mercy on me
To learn that love don’t love nobody
I’m gonna love you, I’m gonna need you all wa ay ay ay ays
To learn, that love don’t love nobody
My my my what a good time lov’n you
It takes a fool, to learn
That love don’t love (oohhh, baby) nobody
