I left you, oh Lord, have mercy
Without saving a dime
Five little hungry babies
All in one room, crying

I thought I was so hip
(A big man)
A big man out in the world, yeah

I thought there was only
Two things in life to love for
A new car and big, fine girl

But I've had them both
Ooh, Lord, that's no joke
I had plenty of money in my pocket
Lord, when I used to always be broke

But I can't forget words my baby said
She said, what goes up
I know, one day has got to come down
Yeah, she said what goes around
Sure comes around, mm

What goes up
I know, one day has got to come down
Lord, have mercy

Now, bad luck has turned on me
I lost everything I had
No one has no sympathy for me
Ooh, they all glad to see me doing bad

I'm right back where I started
In my pocket, I don't have a dime
Girl, I know I failed that day
When I left you and the babies
In that one room, crying

A voice came to me
It came out of nowhere
It said, go home, go on back home, boy
I know there's somewhere there
That she'll care

But I can't forget the words my baby said
She said, what goes up
I know, one day has got to come down
Yeah, she said what goes around
Sure comes around, she said

What goes up
I know, one day has got to come down
Then she said, what goes around
Sure comes around, mmm

What goes up, you just watch and see
Don't it come back down
You got to reap just what you sow
What goes up, Lord, have mercy
Got to come back down

What goes around, sure comes around
What goes around, sure comes around
