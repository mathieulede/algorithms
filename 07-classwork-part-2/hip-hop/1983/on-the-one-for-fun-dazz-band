I know what you know
Don´t you feel it, there´s something movin
You know like i know
Special feeling´s keep you groovin

Who´s playing games when
We can see what´s meant to be
There´s no regrets when
You´re on the one just havin fun

On the one for fun all you ladies
Keep on gleamin like the sun
One the one for fun all you Romeos
Feel the beam, let everybody know

On the one fpr fun all you ladies
Keep on gleamin like the sun
One the one for fun all you Romeos
Feel the beam, let everybody know

I can tell you´re wonderin
Such a feeling is a risky dealin
You like to play it safe
And keepit cool, not be a fool
