Oh my, she's got the look that takes a thousand eyes
No doubt, she will break the rules and cross the line
One man could be all she ever needs to find
But then only one can touch the woman like I know
She will always come to me, well, yes, I know

Wild heart, risk it all at once and drive away
Somewhere there's a kind of love that's in her fate
In time all her sacrifices will be made

I know all about her loneliness, oh yes, I know
No one knows that woman better than I know
She knows love can make it right just like I know
She will be with me tonight, yes, I know

Sweet talk, words that whisper what she wants to hear
So true, still she wonders what we're meant to be
Where's love, where's the exit to this mystery

Is it more than just the like of dark, oh yes, I know
That it's more than something in the dark, oh yes, I know
She could hide, no, she don't want to leave because I know
If there's one love in her world that's me, yes, I know

I know, yes, I know

That supernatural love
Still it's true, I can feel it coming down
It's so plain to me now

Woman I know
Yes, I know
Woman I know, yes, I know

There is no one who can touch that woman like I know
And she will always come to me, oh yes, I know
She knows I can make it right just like I know
She will be with me tonight, yes, I know

Oh, baby
I know, I know, I know, I know
Hey, sugar
I know, I know, I know, I know

I know all about you, baby
I know all about your loving, girl
I know all about your kisses, sugar
I know all about you, baby
