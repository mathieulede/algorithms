[Verse 1]
Friends tell me I am crazy
That I’m wasting time with you
You’ll never be mine
That's not the way I see it
‘Cause I feel you’re already mine
Whenever you’re with me

[Chorus]
People always talking ‘bout "reputation"
I don’t care about your other girls
Just be good to me
Friends are always telling me you’re a user
I don’t care what you do to them
Just be good to me

[Verse 2]
You may have many others
But I know when you’re with me
You are all mine
Friends seem to always listen
To the bad things that you do
You never do them to me

[Chorus]

[Hook]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Just be good to me

[Verse 3]
Life is a game of chances
So I’ll take my chance with you
And you I won’t try to change
We've talked about it and
I'd rather have a piece of you
Than to have all of nothing

[Vamp:]
But just be good to me (In the morning)
Just be good to me (In the afternoon or evening, oh yeah)
Just be good to me

I’ll give you love, I will smother you
I’ll give affection, I won’t bother you
I’ll be good to you, you’ll be good to me, yeah, yeah
Just be good to me

I'm not the jealous type
I won't tie you down
When you need me, I’ll be around
I’ll be good to you, you’ll be good to me
And we’ll be together, be together

[Hook]

[Ad-Libs:]
I love you so
Be nice to me, be sweet to me
Just be good to me
We won’t worry, no no, what other people say
We’ll be good to each other
Ooh, each and every day
I’ll be good to you
You’ll be good to me
We will love each other
Ooh, yes, we will
Just be good to me
