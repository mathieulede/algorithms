Changes - I know you think you've got me where you want me

Tied up in the chains you know I can't shake free
Caught up in the trap you call affection
Now I've seen it all just take your hands off me - changes
Changes
Someday somehow there's gonna be some changes

You can scream and shout but you don't have the right to tell me
Here and now there's gonna be you're gonna see some changes

Changes
Changes
You just don't have the right
You won't hurt me tonight
Trustling you it all adds up to nothing
Dealing with the lies it's all a part of you
Promises that should have come to something
But I don't need your empty-headed attitude - changes
Changes
Someday somehow there's gonna be some changes

Someday somehow there's gonna be some changes

Someday somehow there's gonna be some changes

You just don't have the right
You won't hurt me tonight
