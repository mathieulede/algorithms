Do me a favor
Won't you say what's on your mind?
I may not have the answer
But I can make it easier to find

Too many times
You gave more than you took
Now, I can show you
Things are better than they look

You're number one
(You're number one)
In my book
(You're number one)

Another chapter
Of a love that's yours and mine
This time we've got to capture
Things that should never be denied

My heart reads like a novel
And you'll find that I'm hooked
Just turn the page
And take a closer look

You're number one
(You're number one)
In my book
(You're number one)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ho
My number one

I know you're thinkin'
What do I want in return?
Well, you can rest easy
Your happiness is my only concern

It's rewarding now
If I can make you feel good
There is just one thing
I want clearly understood

You're number one
(You're number one)
In my book
(You're number one)

Too many times
You gave more than you took
Now, it's my turn to show you
Things are better than they look

You're number one
(You're number one)
You're number one
(You're number one)
In my, in my book
(You're number one)
You're number one in my book
(You're number one)

I've got to tell you, you've got to know
You're number one
(You're number one)
Never number two, I wouldn't do that to you
You're number one
(You're number one)
In my book
