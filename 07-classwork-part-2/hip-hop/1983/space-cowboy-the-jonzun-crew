Howdyyyyy!
Space cowboy

Space Cowboy
He's Bad
Space Cowboy
He's Mean

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
There used to be
A Space Cowboy
From this galaxy
He had two laser guns
With beams like the sun
Zapping bad guys
Away just for fun (Space Cowboy)

[Chorus]
He's bad! He's mean!
He's a Space Cowboy in the spacey jeans
He's bad, he's number one
He's a Space Cowboy with the laser gun!
He's bad! (Space Cowboy) He's mean!
He's a Space Cowboy in the spacey jeans
He's bad, (he's mean) he's number one
He's a Space Cowboy with the laser gun!

[Verse 2]
The Space Cowboy
Is one hell of a man
Known through the planets
Of the fastest hand
Whenever he was around
There wasn't a sound
The outer space outlaws
Stayed underground (Space Cowboy)

[Chorus]
He's bad! He's mean!
He's a Space Cowboy in the spacey jeans
He's bad, he's number one
He's a Space Cowboy with the laser gun!
He's bad! (Space Cowboy) He's mean!
He's a Space Cowboy in the spacey jeans
He's bad, (he's mean) he's number one
He's a Space Cowboy with the laser gun!

I say Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yay
(Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yay)
Say Howdy, Hey Hey
(Howdy, Hey Hey)
Well say Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yay
(Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yay)
Say Howdy, Hey Hey
(Howdy, Hey Hey)
Space Cowboy!

[Verse 3]
I'm a packin' jammin' son-of-a-gun
The Space Cowboy from the Crew Jonzun
I'll pack it in, I'll jammin' out
Tell all the hip-hoppers
What it's all about
But that's not all
I like to do
I like to rock it with my fans
And the Jonzun Crew

Say Jonzun Crew
(Jonzun Crew)
What? (What?)
Whatcha gonna do?
(Whatcha gonna do?)
Huh? (Huh?)

Everybody say Jonzun Crew
(Jonzun Crew)
Huh! (Huh!)
Whatcha gonna do?
(Whatcha gonna do?)
C'mon (C'mon)

I say Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yay
(Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yippey-Yi, Yay)
Howdy, Hey Hey
(Howdy, Hey Hey)
I said Jonzun Crew
(Jonzun Crew)
What? (what?)
Whatcha gonna do?
(Whatcha gonna do?)
Everybody say Jonzun Crew
(Jonzun Crew)
Uh! (Uh!)
Rockin' the house for you
(Rockin' the house for you)


[Chorus]
He's bad! He's mean!
He's a Space Cowboy in the spacey jeans
He's bad, he's number one
He's a Space Cowboy with the laser gun!
He's bad! (Space Cowboy) He's mean!
He's a Space Cowboy in the spacey jeans
He's bad, (he's mean) he's number one
He's a Space Cowboy with the laser gun!

[Verse 4]
He was last seen
Between Venus and Mars
Riding a comet
And lasso-ing stars
He always brought us
Excitement and Joy
Our outer space hero
The Space Cowboy (Space Cowboy)

[Chorus]
He's bad! He's mean!
He's a Space Cowboy in the spacey jeans
He's bad, he's number one
He's a Space cowboy with the laser gun!

[Outro]
I said boy
I'm bad
I can do it better than you
Whatcha gonna do
Here we go
