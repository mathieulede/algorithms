When I wake up in the mornin’
You bring me breakfast in my bed
And when I need a little sugar
That’s when you go to my head

You’re the sweetest (Candy man) man I know
And I’ll never let you go
Just say you’ll stay (Candy Man) with me forever
And our love will surely grow, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You can be my candy man
Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
‘Cause I really know you can
Hey...hey...

Candy man
Candy man
Ooh...hoo...

When you wake up in the mornin’
And affection’s on your mind
You just call me up now, baby
And I’ll always find the time

You’re the sweetest (Candy man) man I know
And I thought I’d tell you so
Just say you’ll stay (Candy Man) with me forever
And our love will surely grow, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You can be my candy man
Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
‘Cause I really know you can
Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, be my, be my candy man

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
‘Cause I, oh, I know you can
I know, I know you can

Let me be, let me be (Let me be, let me be)
The one that you come home to
Let me be, let me be (Let me be, let me be)
You’re one and only love (Love, love)

Be my sugar daddy, baby
