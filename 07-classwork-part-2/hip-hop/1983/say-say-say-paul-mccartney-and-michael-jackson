[Verse 1: Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson]
Say Say Say
What you want
But don't play games
With my affection
Take take take
What you need
But don't leave me
With no direction

[Hook 1: Michael Jackson]
All alone
I sit home by the phone
Waiting for you, baby
Through the years
How can you stand to hear
My pleading for you
You know I'm crying
Oo oo oo oo oo

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson]
Go go go
Where you want
But don't leave me
Here forever
You you you stay away
So long girl, I see you never

[Hook 2: Michael Jackson]
What can I do, girl
To get through to you
Cause I love you baby
Standing here
Baptized in all my tears
Baby through the years
You know I'm crying
Oo oo oo oo oo

(Say, say, say...)

[Bridge: Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson]
You never ever worry
And you never shed a tear
You're saying that my love ain't real
Just look at my face these tears ain't drying

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
You you you
Can never say
That I'm not the one
Who really loves you
I pray pray pray, everyday
That you'll see things
Girl like I do

[Hook 2: Michael]
What can I do, girl
To get through to you
Cause I love you baby
Standing here
Baptized in all my tears
Baby through the years
You know I'm crying
Oo oo oo oo oo

Oo oo oo oo oo (say, say, say)
