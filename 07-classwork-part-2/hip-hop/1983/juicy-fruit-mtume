[Intro]
Yeah
(I like it, ooh...ho...)
(I like it)
I need it, I need it
Oh, girl

[Verse 1]
You know very well
What you are
You’re my sugar thing
My chocolate star
I’ve had a few
But not that many
But you’re the only love
That gives me good and plenty

[Hook 1]
Juicy fruit (Juicy)
Juicy (Yeah...eah...eah...hey...)
Juicy fruit
Juicy

[Verse 2]
Candy rain
Comin’ down
Taste you in my mind
And spread you all around
Here I am
Oh, this love’s for you
Hey, baby
Sweet as honey dew

[Verse 3]
Close my eyes
Oh, what fantasy
And you’re right here with me
Juicy
Cherry blossom kiss
What you’re givin’
Makes my body rock
Keeps me sizzlin’
Do what you want
I don’t care
I’ll be your lollipop
(You can lick me everywhere)

Here I am
This love’s for you
Hey, baby
You’re sweet as honey dew (dew)
Close my eyes
Oh, what fantasy
And you’re here, you're right here with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Juicy (Yes you are, baby)
Juicy fruit
