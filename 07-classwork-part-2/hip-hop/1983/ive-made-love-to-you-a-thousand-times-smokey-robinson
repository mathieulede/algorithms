I've made love to you a thousand times
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

It's so real, when I dream about you
I can feel you in the morning
All day long the feeling of my dream
Comes on me without warning
I'm standing there, and suddenly
There you are all over me

I've made love to you a thousand times
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

Let it be, let it really happen
Set me free form loves desire
And if my imagination is any indication
Then of your love I'll never tire
Oh, hold me close, kiss me sweet
And repeat and repeat and repeat

And after I've made love to you a thousand times
And after I've made love to you a thousand ways
I'm gonna gonna keep on with the real thing
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

I've made love to you a thousand times
Even if it's only in my mind
I've made love to you a thousand ways
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

Then I wanna keep on with the real thing
Keep on with the real thing
Keep on keep on keep on with the real thing
For a thousand nights and a thousand days

For a thousand nights and a thousand nights
For a thousand nights and a thousand days
