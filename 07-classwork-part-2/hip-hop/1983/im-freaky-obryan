So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young

So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young
So sweet, so young

Just because I am shy
Doesn't mean that I'm the guy for you
It's just my game
I would like to be
What you think you say you need someday
And lose my shame

I know you're wonderin' why
I don't treat you like the others do
I'm not the same
Ten, got ten on me
There's some things you're not supposed to see
What's your name

[Chorus]
I'm telling you baby
You're much too young to play
But if you do baby
There's somethin' I just got to say

I'm freaky
I'm just so freaky
I'm freaky
I'm just so freaky

Maybe we should wait
'Til we have another date next week
Don't know why
You know I'm here from out of town
And I won't be hangin' 'round too long
It's goodbye

Now I know you're still in school
And you think I'm kind of cool
I need your apple pie
I'm really hot for you
But I don't want you to do no wrong
My, oh, my, oh...

[Chorus]
I'm freaky
I-I-I'm freaky
Oh, I'm freaky
I'm just so freaky, hey hey hey

I'm just so freaky
Oh, I'm freaky
I'm just so freaky
Oh, oh, oh

I-i-i
I'm just so freaky, freaky, freaky
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I-I'm just so freaky
