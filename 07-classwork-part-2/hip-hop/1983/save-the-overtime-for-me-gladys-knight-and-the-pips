Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me

Darling, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
Save the overtime for me

I walk around
Tryin' to find something to do
Baby, until your return
Turn on T.V
Or play some solitaire
It does the job for a while
(For a while)

But nothing takes the place of you
(Nothing takes the place of you)
Just ain't no substitute
(Ain't no substitute)
'Cause you're all that I want in me
Only you can set me free

Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me

Darling, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
Save the overtime for me

My love starts to come down hard on me
And I just can't find no relief, no
Only until I see your face again
I'm gonna be in such misery

Runnin' to the door
Peepin' out the window
Hopin' to see only you

Listen for the phone
(Checkin' out the tick tock)
Countin' if it's a certain time
Hear me now
5-4-3-2-1

Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me

Darling, baby, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
Save the overtime for me
For me

Baby, baby
Save the overtime
Save the overtime

I know you have your eight hours to do
But it just don't feel good without ya

Oh, how I'm missing you
Oh, feelin' blue

I know it's crazy
But I, I walk around
Tryin' to find something else to do
Pretty baby, until your return

Turnin' on the T.V
Or play some solitaire
Does the job for a while
(For a while)

Find yourself runnin' to the door
Peepin' out the window
Hopin' to see only you

Listen for the phone
Checkin' out the clock
(Checkin' out the tick tock)
Countin' if it's a certain time
Hear me now
5-4-3-2-1

Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me

Darling, don't stay away too long
Pretty baby
Save the overtime for me

Darling, don't stay too long
Pretty baby
I know you're working hard for me

Darling, don't stay away too long
