Here we are so close to the end now
Still holding on and trying to pretend now
Clinging to love we both know is dying
We've tried and tried to find the solution
But Darling
All our dreams have been played out
Still we go on hopelessly trying

How many times can we say good-bye
How many times can we see love die
How many times can we give it one more try
Before we really say good-bye
Good-bye

We're so in love but wrong for each other
Each hurt that heals brings on another
Both of us abusing
Both of us using
Darling
It's time to stop pretending
There's just no way to rewrite our ending
We're caught in this game
And we both know we're losing, but

How many times can we say good-bye
How many times can we see love die
How many times can we give it one more try
Before we really say good-bye
Good-bye
Good-bye

How many times can we breakup and makeup
Both of our hearts refusing to wake up
Just can't go on and on
Living a lie
Though I'll always love you

How many times can we say good-bye
How many times can we watch love die
How many times can we give it one more try
Before we really say good-bye
Good-bye
Bye-bye
Good-bye
Bye-bye

Good-bye
