There's a light in the window
Someone open up the door
Cause I'm ready to get down to it
There's a full moon a-risin'

There's a beat in the street
Got the fever
And I just can't seem to lose it
I'll take my chances
Just a little bit of room to move
And I'll be dancin'

I'm a party animal, animal
I'm a hungry animal
Feed me with music, women and wine
I'm a party animal, animal

When the room starts to pumpin'
Like a train runnin' wild
All the night is alive with music
I get up on the table
I get down on the floor
Got the fever and I just can't seem to lose it

I take the fast lane
You can catch me if You can
You're gonna love the chase

I'm a party animal, animal
I'm a hungry animal
Feed me with music, women and wine
I'm a party animal, animal
I'm a hungry, party animal
Out every night trackin' good times
I'm a party animal

There's a girl in the corner
With that look there in her eyes
And she's shinin' her light right through me
I may be lookin' kinda crazy, baby
But you know I can be tamed

When you put your lovin' body
Right next to me
So take your chances
Just a little bit of room to move
And we'll be dancin'

I'm a party animal, animal
I'm a hungry animal
Feed me with music, women and wine
I'm a party animal, animal

Party, party animal, (party)
Party, party animal, (party)
Party, party animal, (party)
Party, party animal, (party)

I'm a party animal, animal
I'm a hungry animal
Feed me with music, women and wine
I'm a party animal, animal
