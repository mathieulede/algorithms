You are lost, you've been bouncin' off the high roof tops
On a plane to disaster
You will crash, I was thinking about it a you passed my way
You will drop if you cannot turn the engine prop
Then you're really in danger
So I stand, though I'd like to make your landin' safe, okay
Lots of runway, room to spare
Trouble due to pilot error
Approach is good, they've cleared the air
Trouble due to pilot error

You're distressed and are tipping back from right to left
While you look for an answer
Coming down you can see the people on the ground go by
You have doubts, take a miracle to pull you out
You can't go any faster
I can see that you haven't any wings to fly, oh, no

Almost home without a care
Trouble due to pilot error (Trouble due to pilot error), oh oh
Partly cloudy, skies to fair
Trouble due to pilot error (Trouble due to pilot error), oh, yeah

You are lost, you've been bouncin' off the high roof tops
