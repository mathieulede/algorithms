[Chorus:]
Tell me if you still care
Tell me if you still care

[Verse 1: Abdul Ra'oof]
Let me know
Have you started to lose your love for me?
And if so
Will you still continue to be on my side?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mary Davis]
I was so insecure with you
Did you still want me?
So I let go of the feeling that you
Were still all mine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Abdul Ra'oof]
Must we both, go on being confused
And placing blame
My heart knows, that you're my number one
Do you feel the same way too?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Mary Davis]
Yes, I know that I still love you
You're forever on my mind
And it's so hard to let go, what I feel for you
You blow my mind

[Bridge:]
And you've captured all my love with your sweetness
And I gave it to you, baby, from my heart
So if we really care for each other
Tell me, baby (Tell me, baby)
Why are we apart?

[Repeat Chorus]

[Ad-libs:]
Abdul: If you still care
Mary: Do you really care?
Abdul: Listen to my heart beat... for you, baby

Do you feel the same way too?
Baby, you're my number one

Abdul: And tell me do you still care?
Mary: Yes, I care!

You're forever on my mind

Abdul: Listen to my heart beat

Do you feel the same way too

Listen to my heart beat
When you're near me, when you hold me
When you kiss me
Do you feel the same way too?
