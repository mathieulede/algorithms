[Intro]
Alright gang let's start from number one
Let's throw down till it's done

[Verse]
Let's get this thing to working
There's no reason to wait
The time is now to start
We all could use the change
Hey, from right now till the dawn
We going to really carry on
We won't stop
Not until we get it right
Out to be on the one
It's not over till is done
It's going to be so good
When we get it right
Got to be willing to try
Even if we get up early
And we work over time
Do it till you get it right
It's an incredible high
There's no limit to what's in it
It's your's and mine
So let's do it till we get it, get it right

[Chorus 1]
Till we get it (Make it shout, toss it, turn you inside out), ho...oh
Do it till we get it (Stay with it and get it right)
Do it till we get it (Never stop, we could take it to the top), oh...oh
Do it till we get it (Take the time, get it right)

[Verse 3]
I know just how to do it
To make it really nice
There's no mystery to it
Here's how you get it right
Well, you make it scream, you make it shout
Toss it, turn it inside out
Never quit, stay with it

Oh...oh...don't give up now
We can make it, we can take it
Right to the top

Come on let's keep reaching up
Believe if it lasts forever
