When times get tough, I want to give it up
I just can't let it go like that
And oh, how long it took to build it up
There must be some reason why we come back

Love, I am alive
The only thing I've ever done that still feels right
Must be sad in my ways
A stubborn kind of fella, he's not everyday

Just keep on lovin' me
Just keep on lovin' me
(Lovin' me)

I dreamed last night that I lost your love
I felt sad because it seemed so real
I don't climb to bed, I had to call you up
And make sure you notice what I feel

How many times, I took for granted
But you know our love was sound
Stay by my side, let nothing feel when
I put my feet on solid ground

So just keep on lovin' me
Just keep on lovin' me
(Lovin' me)

Hey Scottie
Yeah
What does that mean?
That means I'll never give up the love that's good to me

Keep on lovin' me
Just keep on lovin' me
(Lovin' me)

(Lovin' me)
Just keep on lovin' me

Hey Scottie
Yeah
What does that mean?
That means it's just for my baby to know

Hey baby
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on

Just keep on keepin' on
Just keep on doin' it, baby
Just keep on keepin' on
Just keep on doin' it, baby

Just keep on keepin' on
Just keep on doin' it, baby
Just keep on keepin' on

Hey Scottie
Yeah
What does that mean?
That means I'll never give up the love that's good to me

Keep on lovin' me
Just keep on lovin' me
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on

Just keep on keepin' on
Just keep on doin' it, baby
Just keep on keepin' on
Just keep on doin' it, baby

Just keep on keepin' on
Just keep on doin' it, baby
Just keep on keepin' on
Just keep on doin' it, baby

Just keep on lovin' me

Hey Scottie
Yeah
What does that mean?
That means I'm ready to love my baby with all my heart

Just keep on lovin' me
Just keep on lovin' me
(Lovin' me)
