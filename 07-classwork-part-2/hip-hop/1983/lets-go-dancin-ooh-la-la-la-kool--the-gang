I went down to the park - everything was dark
Oh yeah
All of a sudden on came the lights and everything was feelin' right
The people started dancin' - they call me over to join in
They said "T. T. - Don't you feel good man?
Come on and join the reggae jam. " - I heard them singin'
Ooh la la la. Let's go dancin'

I wanna get to know you. Come on

So that everything will be fine. Hey baby
