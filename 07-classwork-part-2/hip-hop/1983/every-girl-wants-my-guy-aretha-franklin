[Chorus 1]
Every girl wants my guy (My guy)
And I can understand it (They want my guy)
Well, they are never going to get him (My guy)
Why can't they see that the boy loves me?

[Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm hot tonight like dynamite
So I know I can keep that man
When it comes to love I'm a cut above
Any other woman
I'm a rough and tough and ready girl (Ow)
So don't you even try it
He can never find any love like mine
So don't you know you're wasting time?

[Chorus 1] [x2]

[Verse 1]
When they see my guy walking down the street
The other guys are mesmerized
He's the kind of guy that they want to be
But they know not to even try
He's a rough and tough and a ready guy (Ow)
So I don't even worry about
Any girl who thinks she can turn his eye
I feel bad for her when she finds out

[Chorus 1] [x2]

Check it out. Dig on it, dig on it

[Verse 2]
[Spoken] Hello? Hey, Kitty Girl. What's happening
Oh, same old thing. Girls trying to jerk me for my man
Um hmm. Oh yeah, Mm hmm. Miss Thang is really after him
Uh huh. Yeah, but you know, I'm going for a black out with him
Oh yeah, girl, he's been snatched by me now
We are full search, for sure
He is so totally tubular. (We want your guy)
Who is... who is that? Who else is on the line?
Kitty, do you have a party line? Well, let me tell you all something

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1] [x2]

[Outro]
[Spoken] And as for you, as for you, Dolly Poo
Don't even worry about it. Have you looked in your mirror lately?
You better dust it off because you are r-u-i-n-g. Ha ha
