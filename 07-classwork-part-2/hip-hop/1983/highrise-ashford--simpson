I knew her well
We suffered through the good and the bad times
Believed above else
She was mine
But she said that it couldn't last forever
Running across the bridge

She said, no, boy
Oh, no,I won't be coming back again
I've got better things to do
I'm gonna miss you

Chorus:
She wants to live in a high-rise
Way up on the east side
A city in high society
She wants to live in a high-rise
Way up on the east side
A city where she can forget about me

I remember the moment
She took me through it in the pouring rain
Said there's something all the love in the world
Ain't gonna change
And as we ran for shelter under the oak tree
She suddenly turned to me

And said no, boy
Oh, no, we've pretended long enough
Now the time is almost here
I won't leave no tears

Repeat Chorus

Said she's got to find a way to get up there
Said she hasn't really made it yet to you up there

I won't be coming back again
I've got better things to do
I'm gonna miss you

Repeat Chorus and fade
