If a man can love a liar
And a woman can love a thief
There's a few things, baby
You should know about me
I've always looked for power
In all the lovers I knew
But now I know the glory
Of simply loving you
You see, I don't play the old charades
It's time to stop the masquerade
Why don't you strip me bare?
Feel the truth
That's all I've got to give to you
Why don't you take these secrets
But keep 'em confidential
Strictly confidential
Keep 'em confidential
Strictly confidential
Keep 'em strictly confidential
Loving you, baby, is on my mind
Keep 'em, keep 'em
I would call you "lover"
But I used that name before
Livin' undercover
Always keeping score
But there's a few things 'bout you, baby
That's breaking the chain of lies
No one else could make me
Open up my eyes
You see, I won't play the old charades
It's time to stop the masquerade
Why don't you strip me bare?
Feel the truth
That's all I've got to give to you
Why don't you take these secrets
But keep 'em confidential
Strictly confidential
Keep 'em confidential
Strictly confidential
Keep 'em strictly confidential
