Is this the end?
Are you my friend?
It seems to me
You ought to be free

You used to be fine
When the chips were down
The head was A-1
But i don't know about now

Girl, can't you see how I feel?
All these feelings that I feel are real
Oh oh, girl
Can't you see I need you?

Is this the end?
Are you my friend?
It seems to me
You ought to be free

You used to be mine
When the chips were down
You used to be mine
When I weren't around

Girl, can't you see how I feel?
All these feelings that I feel are real
Oh, girl, can't you see I need you?

[ALL SING]
Aw, baby, is this the end?
Aw, baby, is this the end?

[Ricky: Bridge]
Mama told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then

Mama told me one day it was gonna happen
But she never told me when
She told me it would happen when I was much older
Wish it would've happened then

Is this the end?
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
Is this the end, girl?
I gotta know, I gotta know, I gotta know
Is this the end?
