You shot your mouth off
Boy
And now you know I'm the talk of the town
You shot your mouth off
Boy
You been spreadin' those rumors around
You shot your mouth off
Boy
And now I find that I'm not alone
You shot your mouth off
Boy
And then it's something I should have known
When boys talk
They don't talk politics
When boys talk
They talk about their kicks
When boys talk
You know what's on their mind
When boys talk
You know just what you'll find
Hey
Let me tell you 'bout my date last night

'cause everything really went right
Don't get me wrong I don't want to brag
But it was just money in the bag
Say money in the bag
She said I never had a lover like you
Boy
You know just what to do
And then I did it so many times
She started sayin' nursery rhymes
She say
Uh, uh, baby
She say
Uh, uh, baby
.
And when she asked to see me again
I couldn't wait to tell all my friends
When boys talk
They don't talk politics. . . 
When you're out on the street talkin' trash

You even said that I gave you some cash
Why don't you go on the radio

Or get your own T.V. show? Don't broadcast to everyone
'cause my love is one on one
I said one on one

One on one
I said one on one. But if you really think that you should

I'll just tell him that you were no good
And you know that I would
And you know that I would
My love is something special to share
So boy
You better start to take care
And watch your mouth
Say watch your mouth
Watch your mouth
When boys talk
They don't talk politics. . . 
Don't you talk about me
Boy
Don't you talk about me
When boys talk

When you're out on the street talkin' trash
You even said that I gave you some cash
Why
Or get your own T.V'show
Don't broadcast to everyone

'cause my love is one
On one
I said one on one

One on one
I said one on one
Burt if you really think
Trust tell him that you
Were no good. And you know
That I would
And you know
That I would. My love is some-
Thing special to share
So boy

You better start to take care
And watch your mouth
Say watch
Your mouth
Watch your mouth
When boys talk

They don't talk politics...
Don't you talk about me
Boy

Don't you talk about me
When boys talk
