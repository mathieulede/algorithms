Here we are on earth together
It's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you

Will it stay, the love you feel for you me
Will it say
That you will be by my side to see me through
Until my life is through

Well, in my mind (My mind)
We can conquer the world (We can conquer the whole world) in love

You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I

I'm glad at least in my life
I've found someone
Who may not be here forever to see me through
But I've found strength in you

I only pray that I have shown you
A brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what's come to me

?Cause in my mind (My mind)
You will stay here always (You will stay here always) in love

You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I

Well, in my mind (My mind)
We will stay here always (We will stay here always) in love

You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
