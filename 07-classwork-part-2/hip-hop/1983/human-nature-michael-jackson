[Verse 1]
Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Hook]
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

[Verse 2]
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

[Hook]
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way

[Verse 3]
Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Hook]
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why
Tell them that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
