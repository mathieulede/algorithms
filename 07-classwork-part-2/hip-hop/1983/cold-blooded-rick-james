[Verse 1]
Who do you
Girl, who do you belong to?
My point of view is
Girl, I think you’re hot
If we talked
What words could I describe
There’s no dictionary book
To explain how you look

[Refrain]
Girl, I think you’re so (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded
What more can I say (Sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded

The way you walk (Sexy)
The way you talk, baby (Sexy)
Mama, you’re too cold for me (Sexy)
Freaky baby

[Verse 2]
Who are you (You look like a movie star)
Girl, what’s your name and number?
Is it true?
That you think I’m hot (Hot)
If we try
To get to know each other
You might find
You couldn’t trade me for another

[Refrain]
Because I think you’re so (sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded
In my dictionary (Sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded

What more can I say, baby? (Sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded
Holy smokes and gee whiz (Sexy, sexy, sexy)
Cold blooded

[Break]
Freeze

[Bridge]
Baby, don’t you know that you’re too much (You’re too much)
You’re too hot (You’re too hot)
Don’t you know you’re like a candle
I’m the only man that handles you (You’re too much)
Baby (You’re too hot)
You’re so hot, you burn me out
Just burn me up

Baby, baby, baby, baby, don’t be so cold blooded
Ooh, la, la, la, la, la, la!
