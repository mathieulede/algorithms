Sweeter than all, all the world
And I'm so proud
I'm so proud of you
I'm only one fellows girl
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
I'm so proud of being loved by you

And it would hurt, hurt to know
If you ever were untrue

Sweeter than the taste of a cherry so sweet
And I'm so proud (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of you
Compliments to you from all the people that we meet
Oh, and I'm so proud
Honey, I love you too (I'm so proud)
I'm so proud of being loved by you

Ooh, ooh

I'm so proud of being loved by you
Baby

I'm so proud of being loved
Baby, I'm so proud of you
Baby, I'm so proud to love you
?Cause it just the way you hold me
?Cause it just the way you touch me

I'm so proud of being loved
I'm so proud of you
I, baby, I'm so proud
Oh, ho

I'm so proud of being loved
You know that I'm so proud, baby boy
