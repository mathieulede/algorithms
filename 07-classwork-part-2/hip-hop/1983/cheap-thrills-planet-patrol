Cheap thrills mean nothing
If you have a broken heart
Cheap thrills mean nothing
They gonna tear your soul apart

I'll do anything on the dare
But I'd stop to smashing around if you showed you care
The smile that you see hides in tears and size
You've taken my love and you're taking my pride

Thinking they're funny they were my place to faith
Your love's the only thing that's heaven in details

Girl your taking your own risk now I played at mine
I've taken too many chances my life's on the line

Cheap thrills mean nothing
If you have a broken heart
Cheap thrills mean nothing
They will tear your soul apart

Like a moth to the fire I was filled with desire
If you felt a thing look out for the nominade
When you're sunny at the club you ignored my stare
You will say "I'm so bad" they say "You, just beware"

Gave me such a loving girl, that all my thrills are cheap
I resigned to killing time and I'm in trouble indeed

Just give it up, don't let me down, girl make up your mind
Insanity is pushing me into life of crime

Cheap thrills mean nothing
If you have a broken heart
Cheap thrills mean nothing
They will tear your soul apart

Feel the beat in my heart!
Being torn apart!
Feel the beat in my heart!
Being torn apart!
Feel the beat in my heart!
Being torn apart!
Feel the beat in my heart!
Being torn apart!

Cheap thrills, don't mean a thing, if you have a broken heart!

Well, well, Yeah, yeah, well, well, well, well, well yeah....

I don't want you
But I need you
Girl you heard me
I came to save you
I don't want you
But I need you
Girl you heard me
I came I save you!

Cheap thrills mean nothing
If you have a broken heart
Cheap thrills mean nothing
They will tear your soul apart

Cheap thri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-ri-rill
Mean nothing
If you have a broken heart
Cheap thrills
Mean nothing
They will tear your soul apart

(One!)
Walk the way we loved all night
(Two!)
When I held you tight
(Three!)
Oh baby, can't you see
(Four!)
Without your love I can't be free
(Five!)
How could love turn to hate
(Six!)
Out of time, now it's too late
(Seven!)
Babe you know, I love you so
(Eight!)
C'mon I'll just let you go!

Whoo-ooh-oo-ooh-oh...

One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight!
One! Two! Three! Four! Five! Six! Seven! Eight!

Feel the beat in my heart!
Being torn apart!
Feel the beat in my heart!
Being torn apart!
Feel the beat!
Feel the beat!
Feel the beat!
Feel the beat!
Feel the beat!
Feel the beat!
Feel the beat!
Feel the beat!

Cheap thrills mean nothing

Cheap thrills mean nothing
Their gonna tear your soul apart

Cheap thrills mean nothing
If you have a broken heart

Cheap thrills mean nothing
Their gonna tear your soul apart

I'll do anything on the day
