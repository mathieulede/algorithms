[Ralph Tresvant rapping]
My girl's like candy, a candy treat
She knocks me high up off my feet
She's so fine, as can be
I know this girl is meant for me

[Ralph singing]
Candy girl...
You are my world
When you're with me
You brighten up my day

All I know
When I'm with you
You make me feel so good, through and through
The way you walk, and the way you talk
You always look so good, you make forget my thoughts

[Ricky Bell]
Do you really love me?
Don't you really care?
Do you really need me
And will you always be there?

[Ralph]
Every night and every day
I'm always thinking of you in every way
All I know
When I'm with you
You make me feel so good
Through and through

Candy girl, you are my world
[RB] You're everything, everything, everything to me

[RT] Candy girl, all I want to say

[Ronnie DeVoe]
She's bad, I know she's bad!

[Michael]
She walks so fast, she looks so sweet
She makes my heart just skip a beat

[Bobby]
My girl's the best and that's no lie
She tells me that I'm her only guy!

[Ricky]
That might be true, but my girl's a joy
She don't play around, she's right to the point!

[Ralph rapping]
My girl's like candy, a candy treat
