[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Every night she walks right into my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

[Hook: Paul McCartney]
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Bridge: Paul (Michael)]
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
But I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
Two on the town

[Verse 3: Michael (Paul)]
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
(I don't build your hopes to be let down
Cause I really feel it's time)
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
Cause she said I blow her mind

[Hook]
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Interlude: Michael Jackson & Paul McCartney]
She's mine, she's mine
No, no no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

[Hook]
The girl is mine, yep she's mine
The girls is mine yep she's mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

[Outro - Michael (Paul)]
(Michael, we're not going to fight about this okay?)
Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover not a fighter
(I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, don't you remember?)
Well, after loving me she said she could never love another
(Is that what she said?)
Yes, she said it, keep on dreaming
(I don't believe it)
The girl is mine (mine, mine, mine)
