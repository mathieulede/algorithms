Boy!
Boy!

[Verse 1]
Now in the street there is violence
And a lots of work to be done
No place to hang out our washing
And I can't blame all on the sun, oh no

[Chorus]:
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

[Verse 2]
Workin' so hard like a soldier
Can't afford a thing on TV
Deep in my heart I abhor ya
Can't get food for them kid, good God

[Chorus]
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Oh no...
Oh no...
Oh no...
Oh no...

[Chorus]
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

[Verse 3]
Who is to blame in one country
Never can get to the one
Dealin' in multiplication
And they still can't feed everyone, oh no

[Bridge]
Out in the street...
Out in the street...
Out in the daytime...
Out in the night...

[Chorus]
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Oh no, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

[Bridge]
Out in the street...
Out in the street...
Out in the playground...
In the dark side of town (HO!)

[Chorus]
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Hey, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

[Outro]
Rock it in the daytime
Rock it in the night
Rock it eeh-dum-pum-pay
Oooh, in the brixton right
