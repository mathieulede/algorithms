Silhouette of a perfect frame
Shadows of your smile will always remain
Beginner?s luck soon fades away, oh, baby
We go on, I will always stay

Long as I live (Long as I live, you will be my first love)
My first love (Girl, oh...)
Long as I live (You will by my first love)
My first love (And I'll choose you again)

I?ll keep an old candy-coated Valentine
Memories of you when you were mine
A tarnished ring on a tarnished chain, yeah
Time can?t change it, come sun or rain, yeah

Long as I live (Long as I live, you'll be my first love)
My first love (My first love, yeah, yeah, whoa, whoa)
Long as I live (Long as I live, ooh...)

My first love (My first love, always be)
Long as I live (Long as I live, you...)
My first love (First love, I choose you again, yeah)

Ooh, ooh, a tarnished ring on a tarnished chain, yeah...
Time can?t change it, come sun or rain

Long as I live (You will be my first love)
My first love (Oh...oh...) (Ooh...)
Long as I live (Yeah, baby)
My first love (I can't change it, oh, time can?t change it, no, no, no)
Long as I live (Long, long, yeah)
My first love (My first love, yes, you are, yes, you are)
Long as I live (Shadows of your smile still remain)
