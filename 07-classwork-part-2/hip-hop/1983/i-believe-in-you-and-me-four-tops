I believe in you and me
I believe that we will be
In love eternally
As far as I can see
You will always be the one for me
Oh yes you will

I believe in dreams again
I believe love will never end
And like the river finds the sea
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me

I will never leave your side
I will never hurt your pride
When all the chips are down
I will always be around
Just to be right where you are
My love...oh I love you girl

I will never leave you out
I will always let you in
To places no one else has been
Deep inside can't you see
I believe in you and me

Maybe I'm a fool
To feel the way I do
But I would play the fool forever
Just to be with you forever

I believe in miracles
Love is a miracle
And maybe you're a dream come true
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me
I was lost now I'm free
I believe in you and me

Mm
