[Intro Spoken:]
You know, baby
I'm so happy to be here
You and I

And I just wanna let you know
That I'd follow you to the end of the world
And let you know that I care

And I want you to know that
If you need me
I'll always be there

[Verse 1:]
Dancing close
Feeling restless
It's a slow, sultry night

It'll be a lifetime
Til sunrise
If you don't stay with me tonight

I feel your breath caress my shoulder
As your heart reads my mind
You don't have to tell me anything
I can see everything in your eyes

[Chorus:]
It's so easy with you
I don't need an excuse
To be the woman in me

It's so hard to believe
That I'm feeling so free
To be the woman in me

Baby, there's so much
No man has ever touched of
The woman in me

[Spoken Verse:]
I love you, baby
Oh

[Verse 2:]
I might be trembling
But I'm no scared
It's just my desire
Breaking free

I've never had a change like this before
To unlock all the doors
To the woman in me

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Like the dark side of the full moon
I've) never shown
What I'm showing to you

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Repeat x3:]
It's so easy with you
To be the woman in me
