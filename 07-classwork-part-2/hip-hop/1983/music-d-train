Keep on, keep on

Keep on steppin' 'til you reach higher ground
Can't nobody turn you 'round
Step on up you can claim the highest star
Straight ahead, it's not very far!

Keep on, keep on

With the strength of your mind you can be set free
You can know the? from your past
Search deep inside and you will see
Time has come at last!

Keep on, keep on
Keep keepin' on, you gotta keep keepin' on

You can make it if you only try
Don't stop reaching 'til you touch the sky
Life has many ups and downs
Plant your feet on solid ground! keep on!

Keep on, keep on
Keep keepin' on, you gotta keep keepin' on

Through the strength of your mind you can be set free
You can know the? from your past

Search deep inside and you will see
Time has come at last!

Keep on, keep on
Keep keepin' on, you gotta keep keepin' on

Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on just
Keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have what
You want, be who you want

Listen, I can't let nobody keep me from reachin' the
Top!
Don't you give up for nothing keep on 'til you get by!
Reach, reach, reach you're almost there!
If you have a goal, set it in your mind!
Reach for it, say to yourself, this will be mine!
K-e-e-p, pressin' o-n spells keep on, keep on pressin'
My friend!
Ain't no half steppin' you've got to keep on pressin'!

Keep on, keep on
