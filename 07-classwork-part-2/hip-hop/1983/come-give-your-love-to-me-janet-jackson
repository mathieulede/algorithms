[Verse 1:]
How can I get you to notice
That I want you
My heart's on fire with desire
Cause I love you

There's no time for waiting
Begging
I would tell you
So there's no doubt
I'll spell it out
Come give it to me
Give it

[Chorus:]
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me

[Verse 2:]
You've turned the spark of my love
Into a raging flame
And now I need to convince you
To feel the same

So don't you stay over there
Talking 'bout the way I feel
Cause, baby
Talk is cheap
Actions speaks louder than words

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Hey, babe
My love just won’t let me wait for you
I’m so weak
You know I’ll do anything it takes
So I beg you please, baby

[Chorus:]
Come give your love to me
(Give it, ooh, ooh)
Come give your love to me
(Come give it to me)

Come give your love to me
(Give it, ooh)
Come give your love to me
(Give it to me)
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me

Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me

Come give your love to me
(Give it, ooh)
Come give your love to me
(Give it to me)

Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
Come give your love to me
