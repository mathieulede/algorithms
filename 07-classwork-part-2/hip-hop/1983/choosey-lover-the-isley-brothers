[Refrain]
Choosey lover
Girl, I'm so proud of you
I'm so glad you chose me, baby, baby
And I'll make you so happy

[Verse 1]
Thought I had a lover, thought I had a lover
But I was kiddin' myself, baby
By the time I learned about it, by the time I learned the truth about it
She was sleepin' with someone else, oh, but not you, baby

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
Cause you've given me, given me security
Given me security, baby and you're provin' what you said
I never worry about you, never worry about you, baby
Jumpin' in and out of bed, no, not my baby

[Refrain]x4
