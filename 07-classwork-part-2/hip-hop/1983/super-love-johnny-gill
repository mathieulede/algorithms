Super love
We go together like a hand in glove
Me and you, yes, we do, girl
Super love
You're like an angel from up above
Who came down to see me through, yeah
Super love
The things you do and the way you talk
I never knew someone like you, no
Super love
And you're the only one I'm thinking of
You and your super love, girl
Pretty little thing
You make my heart sing
Sweet songs of love and laughter
Came into my life
Made my wrongs all right
And now you're all that really matters
When I look at you
Deep inside I know
Girl, your manner is so mellow
When you look at me
Honey, can't you see
You make me one happy fellow
Super love
True happiness surrounds us, yes, it does
Because of you I'm never blue, no
Super love
You lift my sadness into fun
Baby, thanks to you it's
Super love
You're like a flower into dove
You're too good to be true, yeah
Super love
You're the only one I'm thinking of
You and your super love, girl
Girl, I would not lie
Not a day goes by
That you're not on my mind
Honey, if you leave
I would surely grieve
For what would be a long, long time
My heart skips a beat
Each and every time we meet
That flame keeps burnin' higher
Up so high that I can touch the sky, girl
Hee...ooh...
I could touch the sky, girl, yeah, yeah
Super love, yeah
Super duper, super duper love, babe
Super love, yeah
What can I say, you blow me away
Super love, yeah
Super love, woo
Super
Super love, woo
What can I say, you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you-you
Super love, woo
With your super love, baby, with your super love
Super love, woo
Super love, super love, baby, super love, super love
Super love, woo
Super love, baby, super love, baby, super
Super love, woo
