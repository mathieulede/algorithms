Eee, eee

Held me close, then turned away
Said you wasn't sure
By the phone I stayed all day
This I can't endure
This I can't endure, baby

Girl, you know I don't pretend
Why I wanna be yours
So give me some confidence
This I can't endure, baby
This I can't endure

Baby, call me up on the telephone
And babe I'll tell you something

Lover, turn me on
I just got to have ya
Come turn me on
Ooh, lover come turn me on
I've just got to have ya
Come turn me on

Lover, turn me on
You know I got to have ya
Come turn me on
Ooh, lover come turn me on
I've just got to have ya
Oh, come turn me on

(Ee)

Be my love or my main squeeze
Won't you make me yours
Girl, don't you be such a tease
This heart could be yours
Girl, please make me yours

So baby
Call me up on the telephone
And babe I'll tell you something

Lover, turn me on
I just got to have ya
Come turn me on
Ooh, lover come turn me on
I've just got to have ya
Come turn me on

Lover, turn me on
You know I've got to have ya
Come turn me on
Ooh, lover come turn me on
I've just got to have ya
Come turn me on

I don't mind if I'll never feel this way again
Honey, love me tonight, we'll make it right
There's so much love inside of you

Lover, turn me on, oh
Come turn me on
Ooh, lover come turn me on
You know I got to have ya

This way again
Lover, turn me on
Come turn me on
Ooh, lover come turn me on

Lover, turn me on

Come turn me on
Ooh, lover come turn me on
