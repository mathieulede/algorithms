Sometimes you want to kick yourself
For letting things get this far
You get no thanks at all
It's just a double-edged sword

We try to keep ourselves detached
It's clear who holds the key
Drifting through the age of reason
Now, your washed up on the shore

Toe the line
It'll only hurt
What are you trying to hide
When you go swimming against the tide?

You'd better toe the line
It's only going to hurt
What a waste of time
Trying to change their world
So toe the line

It seems like everything you went for
Disappeared like purple haze
Can we ever hope for justice
While bitter men hold nothing close to them?

It was fixed before you were here
You'd better (toe the line) toe the line
What a waste of time
Trying to change their world
So toe the line

It's an English custom
