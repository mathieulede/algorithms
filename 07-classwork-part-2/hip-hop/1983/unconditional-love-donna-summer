[Verse 1:]
What a man
You know it's a bright and shiny day
I want to say something to you
I love you just like Ja do

We know a place
Where Ja's people can run free
A new kind of love
And we call it agape

Don't take too long to find
True love transcends all time
That non-reacting, everlasting love

[Chorus x2:]
Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

[Verse 2:]
Don't try to change
Or tear your brother down
Let him make his mistakes
And he will come around

Hasten just to pray
And Ja's true word obey
In non-reacting, everlasting love

[Repeat Chorus:]

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn

Everybody say
Give me your unconditional love
The kind of love I deserve
The kind I want to return

Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn

[Bridge:]
Hasten just pray
And Ja's true word obey
In non-reacting, everlasting love

[Repeat Chorus x3:]

[Repeat x3:]
Give me your unconditional love
My torn heart to discern
This agape love to learn
