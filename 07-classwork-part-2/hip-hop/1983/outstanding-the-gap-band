Girl, you're looking sweeter now
You got it every day, girl
Wish that I could love you right
In a special way

You light my fire
I feel alive with you, baby
You blow my mind
I'm satisfied

Outstanding (So outstanding, yeah)
Girl, you knock me out
Excited (I'm so excited, baby)
It makes me want to shout (Baby)

Gee, I feel so lucky, girl
To have you all alone
I really love the way you love me
Forever I'll be yours

You blow my mind, baby
I'm so alive with you, baby
You blow my mind, baby
You blow my mind, baby, baby

You light my fire {You light my fire}
I feel alive with you, baby { I feel alive}
You blow my mind {You blow my mind}
I'm satisfied {I'm satisfied}

Outstanding (You?re so outstanding, yeah)
Girl, you knock me out (Dooby dooby dooby dooby dooby you knock me out)
Excited (So excited, baby)
It makes me want to shout (Girl, you know, you know, you know you knock me out)

Girl, you knock me out (Girl, you know, you know, you know you knock me out)
