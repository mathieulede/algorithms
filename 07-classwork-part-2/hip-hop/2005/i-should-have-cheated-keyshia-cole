[Verse 1]
Baby
First of all let me say
You can't accuse me of all the things you know that you are guilty of
And I see
That it is easy for you to blame everything on me
If that's the case
I should go have my fun and do all the things you say I do
Boy I can't
Continue to take this from you

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

[Verse 2]
You say I was out
With somebody else when my girl told me she saw you with some girl
But I didn't
Accuse you of something that I didn't see myself
Realize
That I would never do anything to disrespect you
Trust me
You gotta stop accusing me

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me

[Bridge]
Don't you know I wish I knew that you would treat me this way
If you don't promise me that you've changed your ways, I'm leaving today
And I ain't coming back
And you made it like that
Was unfair to me
All this jealousy
I'm your everything
What will you do without me?
Why you trippin'?

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
I should have gave it all away
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated

[Verse 3]
I should have lied, I should have cheated
Maybe I should have went out to the club
Or maybe I, I should have done it
I should have given away all my love
Or maybe I, I should have played you
'Cause you don't appreciate me, no
And I tried to stay down with you
But your making it hard on me

[Hook]
I might as well have cheated on you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I might as well have lied to you
As much as you accused me of lying
I might as well have gone to the club
'Cause I love you
As much as you accused me of clubbin'
I might as well have threw away my love
As much as you accused me
I should have cheated
As much as you accused me of cheating
I should have cheated
As much as you accused me of lying
As much as you accused me of clubing
I love you
As much as you accused me of cheating
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
I should have cheated
