I've never been down for the kiss and tell
And I realize that you don't know me well
I'm talkin' 'bout grown things
Don't let the words get in the way

I know that you heard all about my past
And all the relationships that didn't last
But we do what we gonna do
There's something I must get straight,baby

See, what we do here stays here
I'm telling you 'cause I wanna make it clear
It's only 'cause I want you to have no fear
That baby, what we do here stays here
And nobody has to know
What's good is if you meet me right after the show
I'm telling you ‘cause I wanna make it clear
That baby, what we do here stays here

If you have any questions girl, go on and ask
Right now while your reputation's still in tact
Ten minutes till curtain call
Everything will be okay

I swear this has never happened once before
Chances are you won't get back once you're out that door
Your body's telling me yes
You can believe me when I say

See, what we do here stays here
I'm telling you 'cause I wanna make it clear
It's only 'cause I want you to have no fear
That baby, what we do here stays here
And nobody has to know
What's good is if you meet me right after the show
I'm telling you ‘cause I wanna make it clear
That baby, what we do here stays here

It's almost time to start the show
I don't want you to go
I want you stay, I'll say it again
'Cause I need you so

See, what we do here stays here
I'm telling you 'cause I wanna make it clear
It's only 'cause I want you to have no fear
That baby, what we do here stays here
And nobody has to know
What's good is if you meet me right after the show
I'm telling you ‘cause I wanna make it clear
That baby, what we do here stays here
