So ask yourself this question
Is this how love is supposed to be?
And how is that you keep findin'
Your way back in my life?
Said, "I'm leavin', have I made myself clear?"
Everytime I find someone I find myself here
No more screamin', there'll be no more lies
Packed up all my bags to go, even made my flight
So how did you find your way back in my life?
How did you find your way back in my life?
How did you find your way back in my life?
How did you find your way back in my life?
I can't tell it, how we make this thing fly
I really thought we'd work it out after all this time
But this ain't how love's supposed to be, in and out of harmony
So I packed up all my things, there was nothin' left to say
So how did you find your way back in my life?
How did you find your way back in my life?
How did you find your way back in my life?
How did you find your way back in my life?
Hey, hey girl
How did you get here girl?
How did you find your way?
C'mon girl, c'mon baby, c'mon girl, hey
How did you find your way back in my life?
