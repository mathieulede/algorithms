[Verse 1]
I think about the day I met the perfect stranger, I think about us
And I think about the day i got wrapped around your fingers, I think about us
The sun was shinnin' on you
The lord was smilin' on me
And love was callin' us
I had my mind made up

[Chorus 1]
And I can't stop lovin' you
I can't help myself
And I can't get over you
No matter what I tell myself, baby

[Verse 2]
Never thought I'd ever love any one else in my weakness, I think about us
And I think about the day you left without speakin', I think about us
I think about the love we had for our children, I think about us
I think about the way we laughed without a reason, I think about us, girl
There will be no more lies
Somebody tell me why I feel like I'm dyin'
Lord what's come over me
Ooh baby, can't you see

[Chorus 2]
That I can't stop lovin' you
I can't help myself
And I can't get over you
No matter what I tell myself baby
Yea, yea
I can't stop lovin' you (stop lovin' you girl)
No matter how hard I try
And I can't get over you, babe
And I don't know why

[Interlude]
I think about us
I think about us
I think about us
And think about us
Think about us
I think about us
I think about us

[Outro]
Mmm babe
I can't get over you
Mmm yeah, babe
Mmm girl
What am I gonna do?
Mmm babe
I think about, the love we had
I think about, the way you laugh
Mmm girl, hey
I can't get over you
I can't stop kissin' you, babe
I can't stop wantin' you, babe
I can't stop lovin' you, girl
Yeah, ay-ay-ay
Can't get over you
I can't stop missin' you, girl
I can't stop feelin' you, girl
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout ya
I can't stop dreamin' 'bout ya
I can't stop lovin' you, girl
