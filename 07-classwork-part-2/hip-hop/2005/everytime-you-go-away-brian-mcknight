Everytime that I'm with you girl
Can't believe you share my world
But it's real
And everytime that I hold you close to me
Forever is all that I can see
How it feels
See I don't give a damn
What my homies say
Don't matter anyway
See I never felt this way before
YOU leave a brother wanting more

I hate to see you go even though
I know when YOU'RE coming back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish that you could stay
Everytime you go away

FROM the very first time that I touched you babe
Couldn't find the words to say
You set me free
And everytime that I kiss your lips
Nothing ever tasted quite like this
What got so deep

See I don't give a damn
What my homies say
Don't matter anyway
See I've never ever felt this way before
YOU always leave me wanting more

I hate to see you go even though
I know when YOU'RE coming back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish that you could stay
Everytime you go away

You're the sunshine of my day
You BRIGHTEN up my life
You take OF piece of me with you
Everytime you say goodbye

I hate to see you go even though
I know when YOU'RE coming back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish that you could stay
Everytime you go away

I hate to see you go even though
I know when YOU'RE coming back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish that you could stay
Everytime you go away

I hate to see you go even though
I know when YOU'RE coming back
It's hard to breathe without you girl
And baby that's a fact
I know sometimes you have to leave
But I wish that you could stay
Everytime you go away
