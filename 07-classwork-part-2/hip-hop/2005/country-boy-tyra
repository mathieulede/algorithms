[Intro:]
Let's make 'em whistle, y'all
Yeah, this one right here

It's to all my country boys, yeah
Awww

See, I love everybody
Midwest, east coast
West coast

But it's something special
About these country boys
Down here in the dirty south
Ya know?

[Verse 1:]
I met a little cutie
He was 'round my way
Accent was a little funny
Are you from V.A.?

He said, "No, I'm not
I'm from ATL."
Well, you doing the damn thing
And you're doing it well

Well, I had my share of men
Blacks, whites
And Indians
But I never had a dude like you

I'm trynna tell you now
That I'm feelin' your style
Can I chill one night
With you?

[Chorus:]
You ain't seen nothing
If you ain't had lovin'
From one of them country boys

You ain't got a clue
If you don't know
What to do
When you see one of them
Country boys

[Verse 2:]
He's got Henni in his cup
24's on his truck
Butterflies in my gut
'Cuz he said, "Wussup?"

He's got fronts in his mouth
'Cuz he'd from down South
Come and holla at me
'Cuz you drive me crazy

Boy, go head
With yo bad ass
What you need from me
Just ask

See 'cuz a guy
Like you
And a girl
Like me
Not usually into rushing
But you drive me crazy

He's crunk like Jon
With a body like Usher
Never scared
Like Bone Crusher
I'll take you home
We can tag team wrestle
And if you like it slow
Give you that red light special
[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
From V.A. to G.A
Miami to the Lou
All these country boys
I'm feeling you

The Carolinas to my boys
In Alabama
Even down in Missisippi
I don't think y'all heard me

Go 'head with yo bad ass
What you need from me
Just ask

Take my number
And baby
Please call
Anytime
I don't mind at all

[repeat Chorus:]
