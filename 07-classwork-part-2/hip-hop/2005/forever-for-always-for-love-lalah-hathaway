There was a time when I didn't have no one
Didn't have no love
Do you remember
The love that we once had
Well if I had the chance to love you again I would
Make your heart forget
I was ever there, oh no
If we forget the past I know this time love will last
Forever, For Always, For Love, Yeah
I'm not coming home anymore
Does it matter?
Well if I had the chance to hold you again
I would fill your heart with joy
Make you remember
I'm the only one for you, yes I would
Let's throw the bad memories out
And make this the first day of our
Forever, For Always, For Love
I'd be a Fool... To... Ever... Change
If he says she Loves... The... Way... I... Am
I'd be a Fool... To... Ever... Change
If he Says she Loves... The... Way... I... Am
It's gonna be
Starting Here, Starting Now, yeah yeah yeah
Forever, For Always, For Love

Do it for the one you love
Oooh, Ooh, Ooh
