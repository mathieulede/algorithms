[Intro]
Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounce
Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounce

[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
'Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby, and that means I gotta
Shake you off

[Verse 1]
By the time you get this message
It's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me
Cause I'll be on my way
See I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me, baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl
Who loves you more than me

[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta, shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake it off

[Hook]
(I gotta) Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
(I'm gonna shake it off)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off

[Verse 2]
I found out about a gang
Of your dirty little deeds
With this one and that one
By the pool, on the beach, in the streets
Heard y'all was
Hold up my phone's breakin' up
I'mma hang up and call the machine right back
I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby, I'm gone
Don't ya know

[Chorus]
I gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
(I) gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake it off

[Hook]
(I gotta) Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
(I'm gonna shake it off)
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off

[Chorus]
I just gotta shake it off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake, shake it off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake it off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give (I like that, y'all)
I gotta shake, shake it off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake it off (shake you off)
I gotta shake you off
(Oo ooo oooo)
(Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounce)
I gotta shake, shake you off
(Oo ooo oooo)
(Everybody just, everybody just bounce, bounce)
I gotta shake you off
