Aiyyo Tim drop that beat for me
Ay girl check this out right now

[Bobby Valentino]
Say baby what's your story?
You got the goods it's plain to see
The kind that'll keep a brotha on his knees
And I'm so curious
After the club, hang out with me
Valentino is sure to please
For now, let's have an Apple Martini
And get to know each other

[Hook]
Ooh ma, tell me
How did you get that in those jeans?
The way you popping it, it's killing me
Look over here, come follow me
Tell me
How did you get that in those jeans?
The way you dropping it, it's killing me
I'll meet you in the VIP

[Bobby Valentino]
Ooh you sizzling, wanna lay you on the floor
I'm a bad boy, just thought I'd let you know
These are the thoughts running through my mind
Cause I'm so curious yeah
Couple more shots then we out the door
Speed off in the coupe cause there's more in store
Can't wait till I pull in my driveway girl
Can tell by now I want you yeah

[Break]
You's a sexy thing
Ooh what's your name
Cause, you're the finest thing that walked in the club
Your girls, they don't compare to
You, can't help but stare at you
Let's make a toast to the good life

[Girl softly speaking]
Ooh boy tell me
Out of all the girls you're staring at me
Is it the way I'm rocking my jeans
Looking at my bubble is making you freeze
Ooh boy I see
You're sexy too, come follow me
Let's go out to the VIP
Hold our glass, toast to the good life

[Break]
