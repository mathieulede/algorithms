I've been down so long
I've been hurt for so long
There were times I thought I would never so the break of day
It was hard for me,to see your plan for me
And I tried to believe surely it won't last always
But night after night, (Night after night, night after night)
I pray Lord don't take your joy from me
Then late one night I read in your love letter that it's gunna get betta

Don't chea know that
I've been looking for you
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found you
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from you

And my enemies, tried to come for me
And they thought that my world was comin to an end
All the while you knew
That I would make it throgh
I feel closer than I was when I first began
Jesus you are, (Jesus you are, Jesus you are)
You are my sun right after the rain
Wherever you are
I just wanna be near you
I'm so glad I can hear you

Don't chea know that
I've been looking for you
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found you
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from you

Don't chea know that
I've been looking for you
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found you
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from you

Ohoh Ohohoh
Ohoh Ohohoh
Ohoh Ohohoh
Ohoh Ohohoh

Jesus you are, (Jesus you are, Jesus you are)
You are my sun right after the rain
Wherever you are
I just wanna be near you
I so glad I found you
Don't chea know that
I've been looking for you
I realized that nothing else will satisfy me
I'm so glad I found you
Now that I'm changed no one can keep me away from you

Ohoh Ohohoh (ohoho)
Ohoh Ohohoh (ohoho)
Ohoh Ohohoh (ohoho)
Ohoh Ohohoh (ohoho)
