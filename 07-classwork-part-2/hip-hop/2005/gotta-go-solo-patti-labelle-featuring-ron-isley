Ronald Isley:
Raindrops on my window seal (well, well, well)
Its quiet as a mouse in here (oh, oh, ooh)
You're somewhere with the girls doing nails
Dinner's takeout, no homecooking all year
Ain't no use pretending (no,no)
'Cause perfect I know I have not been
But theres gotta be a way to work things out (oh)
20 years,should remove all doubt
(chrous)
Ronald Isley: If you love me,(i love you) then how could you go
Patti Labelle: It's not about the love, its just I've had enough maybe we need to let it go
Ronald Isley: If you ever loved me,(i love you baby) then how could you leave
Patti Labelle: some songs have gotta end,we're better off as friends maybe its time I go solo
Patti Labelle:
I know this is confusing to you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But its been coming for a mighty long time ( a mighty long time)
A woman needs to be loved
Into body, soul, and mind
You've been taking me for granted (have I really?)
No surprises, no flowers on rainy days
Now I can keep u just the way you are
But I know some things will never change
