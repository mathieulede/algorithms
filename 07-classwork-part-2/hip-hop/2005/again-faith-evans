Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhh

[Verse 1]
Now I done felt a lot of pain
And I done seen a lot of thangs
From strugglin and broken hearts to fancy cars (oh yeah)
And even though my money change
I try my best to stay the same
But you know with more money
More problems came
But if I...

[Chorus]
If I had to do it all again
I wouldn't take away the rain
Cause I know it made me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I've learned so much from my mistakes that's how I know He's watching me

[Verse 2]
In ATL I caught a case
And the media tried to say
I had a habit
I couldn't manage

And I am throwing my life away
But everything ain't what it seems
Just because its on TV
Cause they speculate and exaggerate for a better story

[Chorus]
If I had to do it all again
I wouldn't take away the rain
Cause I know it made me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I've learned so much from my mistakes that's how I know he's watching me

[Bridge]
Nobody knows what life may bring
It might make you happy it might make you sad
Sometimes yeah but I know there's a reason for everything (but I know)
That's why I keep believing
Whatever's meant to be its gonna beeee

[Chorus (2x)]
If I had to do it all again
I wouldn't take away the rain
Cause I know it make me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I've learned so much from my mistakes that's how I know he's watching me
