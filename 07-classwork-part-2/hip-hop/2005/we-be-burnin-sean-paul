Just gimme di trees and mek we smoke it yow
It a mek we peace so dont provoke it yow
We nuh need nuh speed so we nah nuh coke it yow
Set yuh mind at ease we gotta take is slow

So when yuh see di S.P. floatin dont provoke him
Cau di weed weh we smokin need fi soakin
Best ting fi di meditation, and di best high grade a Jamaican
When we a bun a weed we supportin and promotin
Low di crack and di coke ting yeah we smokin
Herb a di healin of di nation
Legalize it right now we gwaan blaze one

[Chorus]

Everyday, we be burnin not concernin what nobody wanna say
We be ernin dollars turning cau we mind deh pah we pay
Some got gold and oil and diamonds all we got is Mary J
Legalize it, time you recognize it

This purple haze mek me crazy
Mek me write nuff tune and dats what pays me
But its dat not di only occupation
Going to gain som I give yuh education
When a farmer grows it he knows to close it
Econimical benefit help fi those who a fi deh yah pon di hard jugglin
Cau di system only keep man struggling
Studyin people a use it dont abuse it
Cau di concentration well reputed
Dats why herb man dem a di wise one
And it found on di grave of King Solomon
And it good fi di eye sight and di chest sight
And it give yuh nuff inside just gimme di light
And, mek we blaze it we should a neva waste it

Again, we be burnin not concernin what nobody wanna say
We be ernin dollars turning cau we mind deh pah we pay
Some got gold and oil and diamonds all we got is Mary J
Legalize it, time you recognize it

Just gimme di trees and mek we smoke it yow
It a mek we peace so dont provoke it yow
We nuh need nuh speed so we nah nuh coke it yow
Set yuh mind at ease we gotta take is slow

So when yuh see di S.P. floatin dont provoke him
Cau di weed weh we smokin need fi soakin
Best ting fi di meditation, and di best high grade a Jamaican
Cau we know it is a great ting, no debating
Why dem incarserating, true dem hating
Cau dem dont waan see we remain calm
Even though dem got dem sirene on

[Chorus]

Everyday, we be burnin not concernin what nobody wanna say
We be ernin dollars turning cau we mind deh pah we pay
Some got gold and oil and diamonds all we got is Mary J
Legalize it, time you recognize it
Again, we be burnin not concernin what nobody wanna say
We be ernin dollars turning cau we mind deh pah we pay
Some got gold and oil and diamonds all we got is Mary J
Legalize it, time you recognize it
Again, we be burnin not concernin what nobody wanna say
We be ernin dollars turning cau we mind deh pah we pay
Some got gold and oil and diamonds all we got is Mary J
Legalize it, time you recognize it

Just gimme di trees and mek we smoke it yow
It a mek we peace so dont provoke it yow
We nuh need nuh speed so we nah nuh coke it yow
Set yuh mind at ease we gotta take is slow
