(1st verse)
I know you watching
All over here
Tryna finda way to
Come into my situation
But you should know this
Its all good so be cool
Tell ya girl I don't care to fight
I got him locked, and he's all mine
So you should know better than
To think that you could ever put it down like i can

(chorus)
If he needs good lovin (i got it)
If i need to heat it up (i got fire)
Make sure i'm the best (for him) for (sure)
He's running home to me for it
And he knows waht ever he wants (that im with it)
And he knows the perfect place (to come get it)
And he knows that every woman's in me
Fall back and just let me be

You're in violation, let me help you understand
Before we have a problem

When it comes to my man
Please don't let me solve em
Everyday is a holiday
Everyday our anniversary
You should think about the time you waste
Cause my last name ain't gon change

(chorus)
If he needs good lovin (i got it)
If i need to heat it up (i got fire)
Make sure i'm the best (for him) for (sure)
He's running home to me for it
And he knows what ever he wants (that im with it)
And he knows the perfect place (to come get it)
And he knows that every woman's in me
Fall back and just let me be
I gots to breath (uh oh, uh oh, uh oh) please
Back up off of me
I gots to breathe and just be
Breathe, please, in case ya didn't hear me yeah yeah
I gots to breathe so let me breathe, please
