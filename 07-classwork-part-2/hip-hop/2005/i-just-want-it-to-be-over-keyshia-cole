[Intro]
Over and Over
LaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLa (Krucial Keys)
LaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLa (Keyshia Cole)
It’s the way it is

[Verse 1]
Baby I remember
A time when we were so secure but
Now it’s like December
When you say that I’m so insecure and
I gotta get away
Cause’ your making me weak
It’s keeping me trapped (keeping me trapped)
I gotta be a fool
Sitting here tryna get that old thing back (thing back oh)
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
You use to keep your word
Was one who always did what you said
You use to speak to me so sweet
With something caring to say
Oh, you don’t even try no more
Oh, you don’t even care no more

[Chorus]
I don't wanna love you
Don’t wanna need you
Just wanna leave you (I swear)
I just want it to be over (I just want it to be over)
I just want it to be over (I just want it to be over)

[Verse 2]
It’s like I hate to love ya
A charade we play time after time (time after time)
It's like ya love to see me
Confused and a mess I’m losing my mind (I’m losing my mind)
I gotta get away
Cause’ your making me weak
It’s keeping me trapped (keeping me trapped)
I gotta be a fool
Sitting here tryna get that old thing back (thing back oh)
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
LaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLa (La,La,La,La)
LaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLa (No I don’t wanna here it no more)
LaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLa (All the lies, Oh)
LaLaLaLaLaLaLaLaLa (You, You, You use to)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus: 2x]

[Outro]
Over and Over!
