Out in the street, they call it merther

Welcome to Jamrock, camp where the thugs
Dem camp at
Two pound ah weed inna van back
It inna your hand bag, your knapsack
It inna your backpack
The smell ah give your girlfriend contact

Some boy nuh know dis
Dem only come around like tourist
On the beach with a few club sodas
Bedtime stories, and pose like
Dem name Chuck Norris
And don't know the real hardcore

Cause Sandals ah nuh back to
The thugs
Dem will do whe dem got to and won't think twice to shot you
Don't make dem spot you, unless you carry guns a lot too
A bare tuff ting come at you

When Trenchtown man stop laugh and block off traffic
Then dem wheel and pop off and dem
Start clap it
With the pin file down an it ah beat rapid
Police coming inna jeep and
Dem can't stop it

Some say them ah playboy, ah playboy rabbit
Funny man ah get dropped like a bad habit
So nuh bodah pose tuff
If you don't have it
Rastafari stands alone

Welcome to Jamrock, welcome to Jamrock
Out in the streets, they call it merther

Welcome to Jam down, poor people ah dead at random
Political violence, can't done
Pure ghost and phantom
The youth dem get blind by stardom
Now the kings of kings ah call

Old man to pickney, so wave
Unuh hand if you with me
To see this sufferation sick me
Dem suit no fit me,
To win election dem trick we
Then dem don't do nuttin' at all

C'mon let's face it, a ghetto education's basic
And most ah de youths them waste it
And when dem waste it
That's when dem take the guns replace it
Then dem don't stand a chance at all

And that's why ah nuff little youth have up some fat 'matic
With the extra magazine inna dem back pocket
And ah bleach a night time inna some
Black jacket
All who nah lock Glocks, ah dem a
Lock rocket

They will full you up ah current
Like ah short circuit
Dem a run ah road back which part the
Cops block it
And from now till a mornin' nuh
Stop clock it
If dem run outta rounds ah bruck back ratchet
