[Verse 1]
If i'm caught at a dance party without my dancing shoes
And everybody dances on my bare feet
Shame on me
If i'm minding my business just doing the right thing
And you try to front me off in the street
Shame on you
If a family's waiting for that special blessing to
Come their way
But they ain't trying to get on their knees and pray
Shame on them
And if we live in a time where every nation's fighting
Around the world
Yet we can't all agree that peace is the way
Shame on us

[Chorus]
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us [x2]
So what the fuss

[Verse 2]
If i gotta get up early in the morning for a job
Interview
And i forget to set the stupid alarm
Shame on me
If my children are playing outside like little children do
And you come around there trying to bring them some harm
Shame on you
Should i be driving thru a klantown, find a restaurant
To get me some food
And someone says "hey boy, we don't serve your kind"
Shame on them
And if we live in a democracy and you don't use your
Power to vote
Knowing some would like to turn back the hands of time
Shame on use

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If i'm hooked on a habit knowing damn well it could
Cost me my life
Yet i keep doing what i should do without
Shame on me
If you're locked in a marriage and your other half
Just gives you abuse
Yet you've convinced yourself that there's no way out
Shame on you
If we're jamming the music and somebody's got the
Audacity
To say that they can jam it better than us
Shame on them
And should there be just a handful that believe that
We are totally free
And there's no need to fight for equality
Shame on us

[Chorus][x2]
Shame on me, shame on you, shame on them, shame on us
[repeat]
So what the fuss

[Outro]
What the fuss [X4]
