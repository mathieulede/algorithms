[Verse 1]
Say, she flirt with her boyfriend's brethren
Him have money and bling, so she go bed with him

She start to seek penicillin, she's dying

When she hear say, to the morgue she heading
Say, she broke out at the age of seven
Strip dancing before she reach eleven

[Hook]
One man can't satisfy her
She needs more wood for the fire
Sex price getting higher
A more money she require
House, car, and land she desire
So from the prostitution work, she won't retire

Sun is cool, burn the flesh, seller, and the buyer

Then another set to buy her pearls and rubies
