Ain't nobody fuckin' with me man
Heatman
Ski mask
Spending next week's cash
He fast
And I don't even need a G pass
I'm passed that
I'm passing 'em out now
And you can't have that
And my chain, Toucan Sam that
Tropical colors, you can't match that
Gotta be abstract
You catch my girl legs open, better smash that
Don't be surprised if she ask where the cash at
I see she wearing them jeans that show her butt crack
My girls can't wear that
Why? That's where my stash at
I put my mack down
That's where you lack at
She need her candle lit
And I'mma wax that
I rekindled the flame
She remembered the name
It's Weezy Baby
January, December, the same
Mama gimme that brain
Mama gimme that gut
Cause I'm the fireman
You hear the firetruck

[Verse 2]
Fresh on campus, it's the Birdman Junior
Money too long, teachers put away ya rulers
Raw tune not a cartoon
No shirt, tattoos, and some war wounds
I'm hot, but the car cool
She wet, that's a carpool
Been in that water since a young'n
You just shark food
Quick Draw McGraw, I went to art school
Yeah the lights is bright, but I got a short fuse
Don't snooze
Been handling the game so long my thumbs bruised
Ya new girlfriend is old news
You ain't got enough green and she so blue
Cash Money Records, where dreams come true
Everything is easy, baby
Leave it up to Weezy Baby
Put it in the pot, let it steam, let it brew
Now watch it melt
Don't burn yourself
Cause

[Hook]
I'm the Fireman
Fire, F-Fireman
I got that fire, I'm hollering
I got that fire, come and try me, and
You can spark it up and I'mma put you out
(Get 'em)
You can spark it up and I'mma put you out

[Verse 3]
Yeah, riding by myself
Well, really
Not really (Well...)
So heavy in the trunk
Make the car pop a wheelie
Who? Weezy Baby
You call me "Young Baby"
My money 360, you only 180
Half, of the game too lazy
Still sleeping on me, but
I'm bout to wake 'em, yep
I'm bout to take 'em
To New Orleans and bake 'em, yeah
It's hot down here
Take a walk with Satan, yeah
Come on mama, let the Carter make ya
Toss you like a fruit salad, strawberry grape ya
They ball when they can, and I'm ballin' by nature
Addicted to the game, like Jordan and Payton
Y'all in the race, and
Me, I'm at the finish line
Been running for too long, it's time to give me mine
Straight down your chimney
In your living room, it's I
Weezy, allergic to wintertime
Hot!

[Hook]
I'm the Fireman
Fire, F-Fireman
I got that fire, I'm hollering
I got that fire, come and try me, and
You can spark it up and I'mma put you out
(Get 'em)
You can spark it up and I'mma put you out

[Outro]
Yeah, I-I-I got 'em
I-I-I got 'em
Ay, B - I got 'em
Ay, D - I got 'em
Ay, Slim - I got 'em
Yeah, don't worry
Don't worry
