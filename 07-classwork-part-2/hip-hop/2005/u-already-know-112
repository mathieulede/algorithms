[Intro - Slim]
Uh, 112
Uh, Oh baba-ba-baby

[Verse 1 - Slim]
Tonight's your night girl (Yes)
I'm trynin' to give you that thing to make you say (Yes)
From the kitchen floor down to the fire place (Yes)
Insense burning, your body's talking that shit to me
Cancel that phone (Yes)
The only sound I'm tryin' to hear is your moan (Yes)
You ridin' topless, no panties on (Yes)
And I've been thinkin' 'bout this all day long
You're giving me the fire though..

[Hook (2X)]
Papa coming home, like to give you that raw
Favorite position, from the back door
Girl you know the drill don't ask no questions, you already know

[Verse 2 -Q]
Is your girl Jenny home (Yes)
Call her up and tell her it's 'bout to be on (Yes)
Tell her don't show if it ain't heels and thongs (Yes)
I can already see it, ooh what a feeling
Just don't (Yes)
Get jealous if I hit that to hard (Yes)
Cuz you come first
You know your my heart (Yes)
Cuz it'll always be your's, girl I'm 'bout to turn you out

[Hook (2X)]
Papa coming home, like to give you that raw
Favorite position, from the back door
Girl you know the drill don't ask no questions, you already know

[Bridge]
You know just how I like it to see it
(You know just how I like to see it)
You know just how I like beat it, you already know
You know I like to go down and eat it
(I love it when you go down and eat it)
And you know I won't stop until you get it, you already know

[Hook (2X)]
Papa coming home, like to give you that raw
Favorite position, from the back door
Girl you know the drill don't ask no questions, you already know
