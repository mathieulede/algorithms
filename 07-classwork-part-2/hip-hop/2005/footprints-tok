Hurry up and come back was the last thing she said to her son
The day his life was taken
She didn't know he wouldn't come back he died from the bullet
Of a gun and now her little boy is gone

[Alex:]
She said help me, Lord help me a
And she looked up to the sky
And she heard a voice reply

When you cry I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile I smile
I smile along with you

When you cry I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile I smile
I smile along with you

[Verse 2: Flexx]
Another baby left homeless
Abandoned when he was two
So the street side kids at the shopping mall was the family he knew
It's not easy being homeless sometimes you have to do
What you have to do and he didn't have a mom or dad to help him get through

[Alex:]
He said help me, Lord help me
And he looked up to the sky
And he heard a voice reply

When you cry I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile I smile
I smile along with you

When you cry I cry
I cry along with you
When you smile I smile
I smile along with you
