[Chorus:]
Sex in the kitchen nigga,(whoo! Yeah)
Over by the stove (ho!)
(Yeah, from the kitchen to the bathroom babe (uh)
From upstairs to the basement babe) (Kels!)
Put you on the counter (ho! Yeah)
By the buttered rolls (ho!)
(Yeah, now we hoppin' in the GT coup'
Goin' to the club, doin' what we do) (remix!)
Hands on the table (ho! Yeah)
On your tippy toes (ho!)
(Yeah, hey it's the weekend y'all (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So bounce real slow to this remix y'all)
Said the sign outside the door say the restaurant is closed
And we'll be cuttin' up tomatoes (whoo, yeah)
Fruits and vegetables and potatoes (yeah)

[Verse 1:]
Let's get together like a cookout baby
You bring the beer and I'ma bump some 'Sadie'
Hook up some of that chicken baby
And oh yeah, and don't forget the rice and gravy
It's about to be a party at my crib
Got Hennessee, juice and Belvedere
Got chicks in swimsuits up in here
No po, no haters, no tricks in here
Hey y'all, whassup, whassup
Got bounce juice in my cup
Mama makin' [ass] jump up
Sh**t she don't get no f**k
Ain't gotta worry 'bout complainin' ass neighbours
'Cause your boy is sittin' on some acres
Dip low in the SLR (whoo!)
Come and take a ride in my super car
Scattered linen when you rollin' with a player
Shoppin' sprees when you rollin' with a player
At that bar when you rollin' with a player
Big chips when you rollin' with a player
The party's almost over
So baby tell me what you gon' do
Open that door, put them out
Close that door, me and you

[Chorus:]
Sex in the kitchen (whoo! Yeah)
Over by the stove (ho!)
(Yeah, from the kitchen to the bathroom babe (uh)
From upstairs to the basement babe) (Kels!)
Put you on the counter (ho! Yeah)
By the buttered rolls (ho!)
(Yeah, now we hoppin' in the GT coup'
Goin' to the club, doin' what we do) (remix!)
Hands on the table (ho! Yeah)
On your tippy toes (ho!)

Said the sign outside the door say the restaurant is closed
And we'll be cuttin' up tomatoes (whoo, yeah)

[Verse 2:]
Got the whirl pool bubblin' up
Got two fine chicks tryna double 'em up (uh)
Got top so I'm shakin' it up (uh)
When it come to the [#%&@] I just can't get enough (oh!)
This party looks like a club
You see in my eyes and I'm buzzed
I've been drinkin' twenty four hours
So f**ked up you know a nigga need a shower
I pull up in the wide body (ho)
You know a nigga know somebody (ho)
And e'rbody in here know me (ho)
And somebody knows somebody (ho)
Look at my wrists ain't I so damn freeze? (Yo)
Look at my clothes ain't I so damn clean? (Yo)
Look at the bar ain't I so damn sheen? (Yo)
Look at my style I am so damn me (oh)
I got a song out doin' good
Nigga goin' platinum 'cause I kept it hood
I hear the crowd over here goin' (ho!)
I hear the crowd over there goin' (ho!)
That's why I get to show 'em this life
Turned it out and now I'm ready to fly
And now I'm on my way to the after party
'Til six in the mornin' I'ma be naughty
Put this CD in your Jeep (put this CD in your Jeep)
Play it 'til it cracks the CD
Some of y'all be doubtin' me (hey, hey, hey, hey)
But I can do this in my sleep

[Chorus:]
Sex in the kitchen (whoo! Yeah)

[Bridge:]
Here we are, in this kitchen, kitchen
Sexin' each other from feet to head
Now, some folks may raise the question
"Why can't they just get a bed?"
Yeah, there ain't nothin' wrong
With us in the kitchen gettin' it on, no
Girl, it's like five hundred degrees and here we are
By the cabinet do's, by the stove
Hot buttered rolls on your tippy-toes

[Chorus:] [2x]
Sex in the kitchen (whoo! Yeah)
