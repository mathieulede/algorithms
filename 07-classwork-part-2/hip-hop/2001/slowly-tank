Set the mood
Light the candles
And bring the wine
I'm wantin you
Been havin this feelin
For sometime now
Come on in
Take off your coat
And stay a while
I Been waiting for this day
Just so we could make love slow

Slowly (I Know)
We'll be (Making Love)
Slowly (All Night Long)
Slowly (I Know)
We'll be (Making Love)
Slowly (All Night Long)

Slip it off yea
Show big daddy what he's been missing
Tip it off tip it off
Want you to feel right
When I'm kissing when I'm kissing
Really really wanna take my time
With you pretty baby
If you don't mind
Love you all night long

Slowly (I Know)
We'll be (Making Love)
Slowly (All Night Long)
