Yea, Mya
Red zone what what?

It's after midnight and she's on your phone
Sayin' come over 'cuz she's all alone
I could tell it was your ex by your tone
Why is she callin' now after so long?

Now what is that she wants?
Tell me what is that she needs?
Did she hear about the brand new Benz
That you just bought for me?
'Coz y'all didn't have no kids
Didn't share no mutual friends
And you told me that she turned trick
When y'all broke up in ninety six

What'cha gonna do?
When you can't say no?
When her feelings start to show?
Boy, I really need to know
And how you gonna act?
How you gonna handle that?
What'cha gonna do when she wants you back?

There's no need to reminisce about the past
Obviously 'coz that shit did not last
I know how a woman try to game you
So don't get caught up because baby, you'll lose
