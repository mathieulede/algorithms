Listen baby

Let's take a minute and talk about
What turned this home into a house
I don't know what this war's about but
Been through too much not to work it out

Now you say you've been lovin' me
Me only baby faithfully
It's mighty strange when my eyes can see
That you've been cheatin' around on me

I am your woman, woman, woman
So show some respect and treat me as such
I am your woman, woman, woman
And all I ask is that you honor this love

Now I've been dealin' with you since sweet sixteen
Woman enough to let you raise me
You used to call me daddy's ghetto queen
And you still mean the world to me

No sooner than I say no more
I run to you like a corner store
I don't love you enough to hate ya
But yet I love you too much to leave

I am your woman, woman, woman
You need to show some respect and treat me as such
I am your woman, woman, woman
And all I ever asked is that you honor this love

Now we, boo, hours when the clock strikes three
You should be at home in bed with me
Takin' advantage of a real good thing
How long will it take you to see?

Sometimes I ask myself, "Are you crazy
To stay here and put up with this pain?"
You promised me the moon and the stars above
But all I seem to get is rain

But I'm caught up in your whirlwind, I'm blown away
It's gonna take more than some shoes to get me home
I don't wanna, I don't wanna go now
I'm gonna stay right here and rebuild this house

I am your woman, woman, woman
So show some respect and treat me as such
I am your woman, woman, woman
And all you gotta do is honor this love, oh yeah

I am your woman, woman, woman
I'm your woman, you are my man
Soul to soul, yeah, hand in hand
I believe this is Heaven's, this is Heaven's plan

And when the morning comes
You will be with me
Puttin' your breakfast on the table
Daddy do you have enough to eat?

And every day will be a holiday for you and me
'Cause I am your woman, baby love
Just like a diamond ring we
We will shine 'til the blind can see, oh yes we will

'Cause I am your woman
I am your woman, I am your woman
I am your woman, I am your woman, yeah
Until we split up or somethin'
I am your woman, I am your woman
I am your woman, I am your woman, woman
