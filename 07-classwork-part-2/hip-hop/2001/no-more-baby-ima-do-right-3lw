I'm getting a little tired
Of your broken promises, promises
Lookin' at your pager
Seein' different numbers, numbers
Call you on your cell
You're hangin' with the fellas, fellas
Hangin' with my girls
You always gettin' jealous, jealous

I was with you when
You didn't have no dollas, no dollas
Hangin' at the crib
Chillin' with your momma, your momma
Never fronted you
Never brought the drama, the drama
Now you flip the script
Playa, please

No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, say it again, oh)
No, I'm not the one
(You do or you don't)

1 - You do or you don't, don't
You will or you won't, won't
No more
No more, baby I'ma do right

You can or you can't, can't
Be a man, be a man, man
No more
No more, baby I'ma do right

You treat me like a lady
When you open doors, doors
But then you wanna front
When you're with your boys, your boys
How you gonna play me
When I bought your clothes, your clothes
The ones that you be wearin'
When you with your hoes, your hoes

I know you never thought
That I would have the nerve, the nerve
Think about it more
Since you at the curb, the curb
Blowin' up my pager
Say you want a chance, a chance
Listen when I say
Playa, please

Repeat 1

2 - No, I'm not the one
(Baby, I'ma do right, do right)
No, I'm not the one
(Baby, I'ma do right, do right)

Repeat 2

I just wanna know
What happened to our love
We used to be best friends
Where did it go wrong
When you gonna see
How good it is with me
I'm tired and I'm through
With all your "listen baby"

[Rap]
Listen what, playa chill now
Tell me how you gon' cite me when I found out
Honey gotta break it down, down
I said it ain't no thing
Girl, what's my name?
Keelay, Keelay
Look me in the face and tell me
What the dealie, dealie
Oh, you wanna go shade now
But I'm paid now, I know that you hate that
Oh, you got the one now, you warm now
Cuz you thought you'd come right back, save that
You could do whatever to me, and be together with me
Like you do better than me (you do or you don't)
No more, never for me

Repeat 1

Repeat 2
Repeat 2

No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)
No, I'm not the one
(Say it again, s-say it, say it again)

No, I'm not the one
(I could do bad all by myself)
No, I'm not the one
(I'm not the one, the one)

Repeat 1 to fade
