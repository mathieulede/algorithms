[Intro]
Get your hands on his cash, yeah

[Verse 1]
While he was scheming
I was beamin' in the Beamer just beamin'
Can't believe that I caught my man cheatin'
So I found another way to make him pay for it all
So I went to Neiman & Marcus on a shopping spree
And on my way I grabbed Sole and Mia
And as the cash-box rang I thought everything away

[Chorus]
(Oops) there goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) there goes the time we spent away
(Oops) there goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops) there goes the house we've made a home
(Oops) there goes "you'll never leave me alone"
(Oops) for all the lies you told
This is what you're owed
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and all the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up you gotta hit 'em up

[Verse 2]
While he was braggin'
I was coming down the hill just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else till there was just nothing left
And I paid, all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just faded away, away

[Chorus]
(Oops) there goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops) there goes the time we spent away
(Oops) there goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops) there goes the house we've made a home
(Oops) there goes "you'll never leave me alone"
(Oops) for all the lies you told
This is what you're owed
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and all the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up you gotta hit 'em up
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and all the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up you gotta hit 'em up

[Bridge]
All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when we used to trust each other
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get em back without me
Because revenge is just better than money you'll see

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit them up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and all the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up you gotta hit 'em up
Hey Ladies
Oh
If he mess up you gotta hit 'em up
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit them up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and all the clothes
