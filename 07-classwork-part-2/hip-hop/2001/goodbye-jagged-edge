Sometimes
What may be the best thing for you to do
Sometimes that's the hardest thing for you to do
And that, that's real cuz
I know I love you, I know how I feel about you
But I also know that dont make everything all right
And for that reason I gotta say goodbye

(Verse 1)
Tell me have you ever been in
A situation where the best thing you could do
Was the hardest thing you've ever done
But you try to do what's right
And I know deep down inside
That I really wanna be there by your side
But I can't stand to see you cry
Not when it's because of me

(Chorus)
When it's over
I'll never love another
I'm always thinking of her
I'm doing this because of her
Don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna let her see me cry
Looking out the window and wondering why
Did we have to say all those things
That we said last night
Baby, I don't wanna say goodbye
So I'm just standing here wondering why
I just don't like to see when you cry
So I say goodbye

(Verse 2)
Do you think that cuz I packed your stuff
That inside I'm really really crackin' up
Cuz you're wrong, I just hide it good
Cuz I know that's what you need girl
And there's more to life than loving yourself
You gotta learn to love somebody else
And that's why I do the things that I do

(Chorus)
When it's over
I'll never love another
I'm always thinking of her
I'm doing this because of her
Don't wanna say goodbye
I don't wanna let her see me cry
Looking out the window wondering why
Did we have to say all those things
That we said last night
Baby, I don't wanna say goodbye
So I'm just standing here wondering why
I just don't like to see when you cry
So I say goodbye

(Verse 3)
There's no one in this world that can ever take your place
All the love that we shared, it can never be erased
And I know that it hurts so bad
And I'm sorry, you're the best I had

And no one in this world can ever take your place
All the love that we shared, it can never be erased
And I'm lonely and it hurts so bad
And I'm sorry, you're the best I had

And no one in this world can ever take your place
All the love that we shared, it can never be erased
And I'm lonely and it hurts so bad
And I'm sorry, you're the best I had

And no one in this world can ever take your place
All the love that we shared, it can never be erased
And I'm lonely and it hurts so bad
And I'm sorry, you're the best I had
