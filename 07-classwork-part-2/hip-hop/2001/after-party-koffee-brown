And you don't stop
Keep Keepin' on
Keepin' On
Keep Keepin' on
You don't stop

Welcome to the after party

After the party
Let's take a little time
And talk about it
What's going through your mind?
It has me shaking
Ooh you look so right
I wanna ride
See I would be lyin' if I ain't tell you
It made me wanna flip
And you can't tell me
You ain't feelin' that same shit
Girl it's our chemistry
Like icing on a cake
I hope you stay
So we can do our thing
After the party

CHORUS:
Don't stop, you ain't gotta stop
Don't stop, if the music drops
Rock with me
Get on top, you can take it off
What's it gonna be?
Don't you want the after party

After the party
Let's go somewhere and finish what we started
Cause right from the beginning
I was on it
I know you felt these thighs
You know I felt you rise
So why don't we slide up off the dance floor
You and me
Cause I wanna know
Just how deep does your lovin' go
So tell your boys goodnight
Cause we're gonna rock, after the party

CHORUS (2x)

Sweet baby come with me
Cause I wanna do you right
Don't hold back baby
Where you at?
Cause I wanna get inside

Repeat CHORUS until fade
