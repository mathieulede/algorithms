[Hook]
Brown skin
You know I love your brown skin
I can't tell where yours begins
I can't tell where mine ends
Brown skin, up against my brown skin
Need some every now and then (oh hey)

[Verse 1]
Where are your people from?
Maybe Mississippi or an island
Apparently your skin has been kissed by the sun
You make me want to Hershey's kiss, your licorice
Every time I see your lips
It makes me think of honey-coated chocolate
Your kisses are worth more than gold to me
I'll be your almond joy, you'll be my sugar daddy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Every time you come around
Something magnetic pulls me and I can't get out
Disoriented, I can't tell my up from down
All I know is that I wanna lay you down
Every time I let you in
Abracadabra magic happens as we swim
Higher and higher finally we reach heaven
Come back to earth and then we do it all again
(Yeah)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Skin so brown, lips so round
Baby how can I be down?
Beautiful mahogany
You make me feel like a queen
Tell me what's that thing you do
That makes me wanna get next to you, yeah

[Hook x2]
