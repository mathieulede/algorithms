[Verse 1]
Girl I know this might seem strange
But let me know if I'm out of order for stepping to you this way
See I've been watching you for a while
And I just gotta let you know that I'm really feeling your style
Cause I have to know your name
And leave you with my number, and I hope that you would call me someday
If you want you, can give me yours too
And if you don't I ain't mad at you, we can still be cool cause

[Hook]
I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill

[Verse 2]
Damn, I'm surprised that you called
Cause the way you walked away, I thought I wasn't gon see you no more
Since you didn't wanna give me your name
I thought that you were iggin' me, and wasn't diggin' me
But anyway, what you doing tonight?
I'll probably be with my peeps, if it's cool with you, maybe we'll swing by
And you can just chill (with us), or you can just chill with me
As long as you're comfortable, and you feel secure when your with me
Cause...

[Hook]
I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, baby, yeah
Maybe we can
Go and see a movie girl
Or maybe we can hangout girl
Whatever you wanna do
Just let me know
It's up to you

[Hook]
I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill

I'm not trying to pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my girlfriend
I just wanna know your name and maybe some time
We can hook up, hang out, just chill
