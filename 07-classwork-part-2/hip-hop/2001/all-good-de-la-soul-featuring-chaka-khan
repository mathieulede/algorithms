[Chaka Khan]
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh!
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh!

Chorus: Chaka Khan (repeat 2X)

It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin like you think they should - it's all on you

[Chaka Khan]
I don't care about what you think you see
The things you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, cause it's - all on you-whoahhha-ohhh-yeah

[Dove]
I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want (right)
The loving that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's inviting so visualize the verb
You curve thought waves when you're handling the candelabra
So you sitting on the baby grand
Transmitting like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'mma tell you quick that uhh..

Chorus 1/2

[Dove]
I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together
No pepperoni
Yeah you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora
Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with repping for D

[Posdnuos]
We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claiming never been gone
Niggas who cut us off, wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some #'s to dial)
Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick (or show me loving by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shaking my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all..

Chorus

[Posdnuos] You see them kids be scheming on what we done copped
[Chaka Khan] Always out there scheming!
[Posdnuos] They steady fiending for the moment they can get us off the block
[Chaka Khan] Why they always fiending?

[Posdnuos]
Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothing guaranteed

[Chaka Khan]
That's the truth! Things ain't goin like you think they should

[Posdnuos]
A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Alright then; here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head
Trying to keep my pockets on stuffed - like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all DON'T FAZE
So mind your biz and walk away
Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

[Chaka Khan]
I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been there and paid my dues
I can't change how you feel, cause it's all, on you-whoahhha-ohhhhh

Chorus
