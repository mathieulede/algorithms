[Verse 1]
Talk to me, tell me
Where you were (late last night)
You told me you were with your friends
Hanging out (late last night)
You're lying, 'cause you're stuttering
Now where were you (late last night)
Stop lying to me, 'cause you're ticking me off
See you're ticking me off, ooh

[Chorus]
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter

[Verse 2]
I called you on your cell phone
No answer (tell me why)
So I paged you, On your two-way
Still no response (tell me why)
I took care of you, I loved you
And you played me (tell me why)
Stop lying to me about where you been
'Cause you're ticking me off, t-t-ticking me off

[Chorus]
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter

[Bridge]
Quit your lying heffer, watch yourself
Yeah, I'll give the whips but leaving you out here by yourself
I'm keepin' it gangsta with all the tattoos and platinum mouth
I was the rapper you heard about strappin' up in the Waffle House

Right next to niggas when I be sparkin' 'em out
And I'm way too cold to plain let you come and dog me out
Should've of knew what you was up to when you got here
Get off my couch, get
And I just can't change it
It's gonna be good, get out on ya route
My bad, you're out

I seen it coming with that nappy hair
She was running docked out wanting what you had
You let him set you up and you fell for it
Now it's "I-I-I'm sorry" my ass
That's why you're paying for it
You got the garbage, I got the trash can for it
The man ain't gon stand for it
You better respect my flow
Don't be stuttering when you're talking to Mystikal
Or lying when you be talking to Joe

[Verse 3]
I smell cologne, damn it's strong
How'd you get it on (I'm not dumb)
He messed up your hair, makeup's everywhere
Oh yeah (I'm not dumb)
Girl, you're crying 'cause you're lying
To my face (I'm not dumb)
Stop lying about seein' a man
'Cause you're ticking me off, t-t-ticking me off

[Chorus]
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter

I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
I can tell you're lying
'Cause when you're replying
Stutter, stutter, s-s-stutter, stutter
