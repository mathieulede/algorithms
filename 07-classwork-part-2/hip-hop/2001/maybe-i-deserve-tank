[Intro]
Do you mind if I tell the truth for a second, yall?

[Verse 1]
Maybe I deserve..
To wonder who's calling so damn late
For you to say I'm tripping, just a homie from upstate
(said it's just a homie)
Don't he know its one o' clock in the mornin'
You say baby its cool (baby its cool)
Maybe I deserve..
For you to say he's comin' into town (later on this evenin')
You was just wondering if you and him can hang out
I don't like it, but I know I gotta trust you
It ain't cool cause I know it's true

[Hook (x2)]
Maybe I deserve..
For you to go out and find some other guy
Maybe I deserve..
For you to stay out with him all night
Maybe I deserve..
For you to do all the things I did to you
Maybe I deserve..
Maybe I deserve..

[Verse 2]
Maybe I deserve..
For you to put on a sexy dress
For me to ask you "who the hell you tryna impress?"
For you to laugh it off like it ain't nothin'
I know its somethin'
(maybe, just maybe)
Maybe I deserve..
To sit at home and wonder where you are
Is he kissin' you, touchin' you, holdin' you, what?
To take a drink to help ease my mind
I wanna be mad (wanna be)
After all those times (after all those times)

[Hook (x2)]
Maybe I deserve..
For you to go out and find some other guy
Maybe I deserve..
For you to stay out with him all night
Maybe I deserve..
For you to do all the things I did to you
Maybe I deserve..
Maybe I deserve..

[Verse 3]
Maybe I deserve..
For me to ask you "where you've been?"
Maybe I deserve..
For you to say "I better stop trippin'"
Maybe I deserve..
To grab your neck until you let me know
Maybe I deserve..
For you to run cryin', cryin' out the door
Maybe I deserve..
To grab my coat, and chase you down the street
Maybe I deserve..
To say its not you, it's my own insecurities
Maybe I deserve..
For you to say "yes I cheated on you"
Maybe I deserve..
And I won't care cause after all I put you through
Maybe I deserve..
To be mistreated sometimes
Maybe I deserve..
To even be, lied to sometimes..
Maybe, maybe you should go cheat on me too
