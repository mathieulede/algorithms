Here it is...

(Verse 1)
She caught me by surprise, I must say
'Cause I never have seen a pretty face
With such a warm and beautiful smile
It wasn't hard for me to notice her style

I was fascinated surely
She took my heart and held it for me
I wouldn't let her get away
Not until she heard me say...

(Chorus)
Excuse me miss, but what's your name?
Where are you from, and can I come?
And possibly, can I take you out tonight?

To the movies, to the park
I'll have you home, before it's dark
So let me know
Can I take you out tonight?

(Verse 2)
Don't care if I get rejected
At least and I won't regret it
Regret the fact I miss a chance for romance at least
I'll walk away knowing, I tried my best and I'm going

I'm going on with my day
Not at least she heard me say

(Chorus x2)

That's why I had to come over
And introduce myself
Girl you never know where you find love
And hopefully, I'll find that it is you!!
