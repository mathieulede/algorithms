[Verse 1]
Alone in a room
It's just me and you
I feel so lost
Cause I don't know what to do
Now what if I choose the wrong thing to do
I'm so afraid, afraid of disappointing you

[Chorus]
So I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life is so cloudy
Guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
My hopes and dreams
Are fading fast
I'm all burned out
And I don't think my strenghts gonna last
So I'm crying out
Crying out to you
Lord I know that you're the only one
Who is able to pull me through

[Chorus]
So I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life seems so cloudy
Lord guide me until I'm sure
I open up my heart

[Bridge]
So show me how
To do things your way
Don't let me make the same mistakes
Over and over again
Your will'll be done
And I'll be the one
To make sure the it's carried out
And in me, I don't want any doubt
That's why...

[Chorus]
I need to talk to you
And ask you for your guidance
Especially today
When my life seems just a little bit cloudy
Lord you can guide me through
Thats why I open up
I open up my heart, my heart
My heart, my heart

[Chorus]
All I need to do
Is hear a single word from you
I open up my heart
Just one word could make
A difference in what I do Lord (guide until I'm sure)
I open my heart to you
You just say one word
I open up my heart to you

You're the lover of my soul
Captain of my sea
I need a word from you
That's why I open up my heart
