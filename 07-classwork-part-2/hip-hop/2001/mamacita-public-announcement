Chorus -
Mamacita
Where you at?
Been trying to reach ya
All alone, you know I need ya
Got me fiendin'
Can I meet ya?
I need to see ya
Hesitatin'
Can't do that
Don't keep me waitin'
On the floor
It's gettin' late and
Got me fiendin'
Tryna reach ya
Mamacita

Hey there shorty
I've been feeling you
Like them jeans do, feel me?
Like the way you move
What the deal, young Philly?
Can I get my groove on?
I've been waiting long enough
You got to lace me up just once
You know you can't deny me
When they playing our song
A little bump and grind
Yeah you know ain't nothin' wrong
Say won't you give me time
Now they're playin' our song

Patty cake, patty cake
Baker's man
Let me see you shake it
Like I know you can
Why you wanna tease me?
Got to give me some more
Come on, come on
One, two, three
What's it gonna be?
Four, five, six
Baby move them hips
Seven, eight, nine
You're runnin' outta time
Come on, come on

[Chorus]
This is how I yippie-yi-yippie-yo-yippie-yah
We can body bump from the Chi to the Bay
Like the way you bounce
Want to see a triple play?
First, second, third
Make it home, no delay
What you wanna do?
Baby girl take a swing
Knock it out the park baby girl
Do your thing
Come on hook it up
Show me love, do it right
We can set it off
Turn me on here tonight, uh

Repeat Chorus until end
