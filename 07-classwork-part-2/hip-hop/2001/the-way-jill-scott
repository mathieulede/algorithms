[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with a smile on my face
Jumped out of bed, took a shower, dressed, cleaned up my place
Made me some breakfast, toast, 2 scrambled eggs, grits
Grabbed my keys, grabbed my purse, grabbed my jacket off to work
Beaming all the way down 3rd

[Chorus]
Is it the way you love me baby?
Is it the way you love me baby? (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Four thirty, can't wait to get home
Nah, girl I got something else to do
(Damn Jill, don't be frontin' on your girls for real)
Go 'head, really get your groove on
Cause tonight my man's coming through (Oh word?)yeah
We gonna have to connect some other time
As much as I like to shake my thing on the dance floor
I got another nasty, freaky just right way in mind
Tonight I'm gonna beat the high score

[Chorus]
Is it the way you love me baby? (Yeah)
Is it the way you love me baby? (Baby)
Is it the way you love me baby? (Is it, is it the way)
Is it the way you love me baby?
