[Verse 1: Carl Thomas]
I always dreamed that everything would be okay
With me and you, but I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes I didn't see all the things
I used to see, what's going on?

[Faith Evans]
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby please, no more, no more

[Hook]
Never imagined you would be
A faded picture, I'm emotional
It's so believing, your deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
I can't forget that night I saw you in the corner
Wrapped up tight, you were warm
Slow dancing on the floor while I was watching
From the door so hurt, there you were
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see you, were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby please no more, no more

[Chorus]
Never imagined you would be
A faded picture, I'm emotional
It's so believing, your deceiving
It's official, I'm emotional

[Bridge]
You had your chance
But you threw it all away
Thought you had my love always
Oh baby, I don't understand
How you think that we could stay
In total unhappiness

[Chorus till end]
