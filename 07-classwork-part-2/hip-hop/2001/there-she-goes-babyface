It's something about her you know that
The way she cares of herself, she's just so Bad..
Oooh I dont know

Verse1:
Her style, her mind compares
To nothing on this earth
She's not the kind to share
Only God know what shes worth

(B-Section)
I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her than I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing
I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing

Chorus:
Her eyes,her smile,her skin
Her smell, her hair ( she's incredible)
Her walk, her talk, her way
Her savoir faire
There she goes
(There she goes) (There she goes)

Verse2:
I hope to find her there
Gotta make some eye contact
She's not the kind to stare
Move quick or lose her fast

B- Section
I gotta show her that i want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing
I gotta show her that I want her
I recognize that she is bad
If I can't have her then I'll go crazy
Spending all my time just chasing

Chorus

Spending all my time watchin' that girl go (dance)
Gotta love the way she moves (Get up girl)
Spending all my time watchin' that girl go (dance)
Gotta love the way she moves (Get up girl)

Chorus

Til fade
