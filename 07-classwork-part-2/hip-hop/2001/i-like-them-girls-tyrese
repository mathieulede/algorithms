Get a call from my crew this weekend
Talkin bout a party said it's gonna be crackin
Since imma drive the porsche i tell em push the blue benz
Cause when it's over straight parkin lot pimpin
So once i find my keys to the ride
Hit the spot around 11:45
Cuz everybody knows that's when it gets hot
Tonight i'm gonna find a lil shorty for a player to cop yeah

I need a hot girl for me
A sexy lil mommy
Knows how to turn me on
Freak me from the night to the early morn
A girl who knows just what she wants
If you see it baby dont front
Hair fly and nails done lookin she got one
That's the kind i like

I like them girls between the sheets
Like them girls iced up like me
I like them girls in the fly gucci
Rollin deep in the 6, cartier on the wrist
I like em thick
Small waist with the big ol hips
I like them girls in the drop bentley
That's the kind of girl i need

Out the corner of my eye spot a shorty
Ice so bright baby lightin up the party
She got the prada fitting right on her body
36-24 how could I let her pass me
I approached her with the game on tight
Said you's the kind of flavor i like
She said whats up with later tonight
Gonna do whatever feels right to you
