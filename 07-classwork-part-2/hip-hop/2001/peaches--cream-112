Peaches and cream
Know what I mean

[fabolous]
Ma
I can't get enough
Im a fiend for peaches
I done freaked everywhere from
Limousines to beaches
The kids well known by
Deans and teachers
Its that player who even
Scored in between the bleachers
Chicks used to be
Seam and speechless
Now they talk because the
X-5 got so many
Screens and features
That's why I threw marines
On each-trice
Look it's the f-a-b-o-l-o-u-s

[112]
Let me tell you
What I wanna do
Let me show you
That Im feelin you
Wanna sex wanna
Ride with you you
Wanna kiss wanna
Put my lips all over you
Can't get enough of you
Always taken of you
So sweet so very wet
So good girl
You make me sweat
Girl Im talkin bout
Peaches and cream

[Chorus]
[112]
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know
That Im a fiend
Gettin freaky in my
Bentley limousine
Its even better
When it's with ice-cream
Know what I mean

[repeat Chorus]
[112]
I never thought that
I would be so addicted
To you on top underneath
On the side of you
Better yet baby
Inside of you
Love the way
You just flowing down and
I can feel it all around
In the front in the back
Of you oh
I love the taste of you
Girl you know
What Im talkin bout

[repeat Chorus twice]
Yeah oh yeah yeah

[fabolous]
My nigga mase gonna
Bust through those doces
Few mo roses
Meet me in room uno doce
You know mo say
Its even better
When it's with ice-cream
Know what I mean
I ain't with the ordinary
I get the strawberries
Straight to the hole
With my shit like marbury
Never down with a quickie
And it ain't no secret
Im trying to strip you
Down to your vickie
Some girls be tweakin
Believing Im lookin
For a freak in the morning
A freak in the evening
Thatll do more than kiss me
On my cheek
When Im leavin
Can change a way a man
Speakin and breathin
Sugar. I know you love
Some cream in your coffee
Ill give it to you till
You scream get him off me
Ya pants is up now
A minute ago
You was shaking like
You was doing that
Dance from uptown
