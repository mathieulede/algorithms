[Chorus]
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

[Verse 1]
Hey pretty mama how you doing?
Said I'm just in town for the weekend
Looking for a little trouble to get into
Baby tell me what you're drinking
And I got you, ooh

[Bridge]
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah

[Chorus]
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

[Verse 2]
Now you're body's got me feelin' like spending
With a backroom I could come to live in
And your hair weave looking kind of pretty
The way you back it up on me baby
Lord have mercy

[Bridge]
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah

[Chorus]
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

[Verse 3]
If it's your birthday
Then put your hands up
You wanna get drunk
Then put your hands up
And if you got some cash
Then put your hands up
Have your own job
Put your hands up

[Bridge]
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
Feels so good to say it again
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah

[Chorus]
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out (feel thugged out)
As I walk you to the dance floor (walk you to the)
We begin to dance slow (we begin to)
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out (feel thugged out)
As I walk you to the dance floor (walk you to the dance floor)
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out (and I hope you like it girl)
As I walk you to the dance floor (walk you to the)
We begin to dance slow (we begin to)
Put your arms around me (put your)
I'm feelin' on your booty

This is my song for real, no doubt (Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
As I walk you to the dance floor(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
We begin to dance slow(Feeling on your booty, booty, booty, booty)
Put your arms around me(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
I'm feelin' on your booty(Booty, booty, booty, booty)

This is my song for real, no doubt (Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
As I walk you to the dance floor(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
We begin to dance slow(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
Put your arms around me(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
I'm feelin' on your booty(Booty, booty, booty, booty)
