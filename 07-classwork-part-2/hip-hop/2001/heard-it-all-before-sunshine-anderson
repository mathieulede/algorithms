[Guy]
"Baby let me explain to you I'm sayin'"
[Girl]
What you sayin'
[Guy]
It's not even like that
[Girl]
It wasn't like that but I saw you
[Guy]
Baby I don't love her
[Girl]
You know what I don't even want to talk to you
[Guy]
She don't mean nothing to me
[Girl]
I don't even want to see ya face
I just want to see you walking thourgh that door
There ain't nothing else to say
Peace

[Verse 1]
Come home late it seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gonna get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
If you want some loving I suggest you go back
There where you came from

[Verse 2]
Day to day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse

[Chorus]
See I
Heard it all before
(Heard it all before)
All of ya lies, all of ya sweet talk
Baby this, baby that
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down
(I had to shut you down)

Played the fool before
(Played the fool before)
I was your fool I believed in you
Yes I did, yes I did
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down
(I had to shut you down)

[Verse 3]
What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Have me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets

[Verse 4]
Nothing you can do and there's nothing you can say
That would persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out, I am no longer concerned

[Chorus]

Use to hang on to your every word
But the more you lie to me the more I hurt
The things you use to say would sound so sweet
I was naive quick to believe

[Chorus]

Heard it all before
You know you messed up
You got to know you messed up
You got to go now say what you want
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down
(I had to shut you down)

Played the fool before
I done change the locks on the door
Yes I did and you ain't welcome no more
But your lies ain't working now
Look who's hurting now
See I had to shut you down
(I had to shut you down)

See I heard it all before
