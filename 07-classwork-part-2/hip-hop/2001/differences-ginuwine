Oh, hey...
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
To you
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

[Hook]
My whole life has changed
Since you came in, I knew back then
You were that special one
I'm so in love, so deep in love
You make my life complete
You are so sweet, no one competes
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight

[Verse 1 : Ginuwine]
Girl, you open me, I'm wide open
And I'm doing things I never do
But I feel so good, I feel so good
Why it takes so long for me finding you
This is my story and I'm telling you
It's not fiction, it's surely a fact
Without you right here having my back
I really don't know just where I'd be at

[Hook]
My whole life has changed (My whole life has changed)
Since you came in, I knew back then (Ooh...oh...)
You were that special one (You were that)
I'm so in love, so deep in love
You make my life complete (You make, make my love
Complete)
You are so sweet (Oh, oh), no one competes
Glad you came into my life (Ooh...)
You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight

[Verse 2 : Ginuwine]
I analyzed myself, I was buck wild
Never thought about settling down
But all the time I knew I was ready
But not with all my friends around
But girl, I put you first now (I put you first now)
You made me, helped mold me (Helped mold me, baby)
Turned me into a man, I'm so responsible
And I owe it all to you

[Hook]
My whole life has changed (My whole life has changed)
Since you came in, I knew back then (Oh, oh)
You were that special one (You were that special one)
I'm so in love, so deep in love (Oh, oh, oh....)
You make my life complete (You make my life complete)
You are so sweet, no one competes
Glad you came into my life (So glad you came in)
You blind me with your love (Blind me, baby), with you
I have no sight

[Bridge]
(God has blessed me) God has blessed me, baby
Girl, He was good to me when He sent you
(I'm so happy, baby)
I'm so happy, I'm so happy, baby, oh, yes, baby
(Share my world) Come and share my world, baby
Oh...whoa...yeah. yeah
(I'm so in love) I'm so in love
I'm addicted to your love, baby, yeah...

[Hook]
My whole life has changed (Oh, yes, I am)
Since you came in, I knew back then (Ooh)
You were that special one (You were that very, very
Special one)
I'm so in love (You were that very, very special one)
So deep in love
You make my life complete (You make my life complete)
You are so sweet (Yes, you did, baby), no one competes
(No one competes, oh)
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love (Come on), with you I have
No sight
My whole life has changed (My whole life has changed)
Since you came in, I knew back then (You made a
Difference in my life)
You were that special one (I knew you were that
Special one)
I'm so in love, so deep in love (When I first laid
Eyes on you, babe)
You make my life complete (You make my life complete
Darlin')
You are so sweet, no one competes (No one competes
Baby)
Glad you came into my life (No one, no one)
You blind me with your love (No one), with you I have
No sight (Come on)
My whole life has changed (Oh...whoa...whoa...whoa...)
Since you came in, I knew back then..
