All the many days you were on my mind
Visions of me with you all the time
You wasn't looking for a man
You made it clear (clear to me)
And now I'm ever so glad that I have you near

Here in my life just you and I
We can do whatever we want to
I'm living my life with you by my side
One day I'm make you my wife, baby

Chorus:
I was excited cause I was falling
Falling in love with you
Now that I've falling
What am I'm gonna do

I'll do whatever puts a smile on my baby's face
Girl, you're my best friend
You can never be replaced
There's nothing in this world
I wouldn't do (do for you)
You are one of my favourite dreams
And I'm so glad that it came true

Here in my life just you and I
We can do whatever we want to
I m living my life with you by my side
One day I'm make you my wife, baby

Since I gave you all my trust
And you've given so much love
You're everything I want and need
Girl, you got the best of me
