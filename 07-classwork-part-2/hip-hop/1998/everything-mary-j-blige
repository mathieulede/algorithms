[Intro]
You are my everything
You are my everything
You, my everything
Everything, everything, everything

[Verse 1]
It's all because of you, I'm never sad and blue
You've brightened up my days in your own special way
Whenever you're around, I'm never feeling down
You are my trusted friend, on you I can depend
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred to me the first time I saw your face
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]
You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 2]
My darling only you can make my dreams come true
And every night I pray, you'll never go away
I promise I will try until the day I die
To treat you like a king cause you are my everything
You take me away from the pain and you bring me paradise
And when there were cloudy days you brought sunshine in my life
It never occurred
I would fall so deep in love that your love can't be replaced

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 3]
When you're lovin' me, put your lovin' arms around me
When you're lovin' me, said I feel so safe, I find security
When you're lovin' me, forever I want you to hold me
My everything, my every, every, every, everything

[Chorus] + [Bridge] + [Chorus]

You are my everything
Love so good only you can bring
You are my everything
You are everything and everything is you

[Outro]
And I thank you, thank you, thank you
