Times are harder now
Then they've ever been before
(Don't be discouraged)
So much hurt and pain
That it seems so hard to bare
(You gotta remember)

Faith is the only thing
That you can count on
Stand on His promises
That you may be strong

I'm here to let you know
There's always hope for you and me
In spite of what it feels like

Chorus
Well alright
Keepin' ya head up high no matter cause
It's Alright
Believing a change gon' come today or even tonight
And He's gonna answer every little prayer
Just hold on, wait and see
You know it's gonna be alright

Crying all night long
Feeling like you're so alone
(But don't you worry)
Cause season's have to change
It won't always be this way (so just remember)

Love is the only key
That opens every door
Releases everything
All that you need and more
I've got to let you know
There's always hope for you and me
In spite of what it seems like

Repeat Chorus

There's so much life
To live for
Joy and happiness instore

There's so much more
You can be
Buy you gotta ask and you'll receive
Alright, Alright, Alright

Repeat chorus
