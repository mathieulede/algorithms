Rain, rain falls down, empty streets
And I'm falling through the trees
And they're calling out for rain, rain

Rain and it's plain to see
Rain, what it does to me

Yeah, rain, rain pours down endlessly
Here I'm falling through the trees
And they're calling out for rain, rain

What is rain, rain is rain
Rain is God's own lydocaine
Rain is good that's understood
Rain

Rain, what it does to me
Rain, rain pours down endlessly
And I'm falling through the trees
And they're calling out for rain, rain
Rain, rain
