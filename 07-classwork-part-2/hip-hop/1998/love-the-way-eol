So you’re feeling alone and still yet you got no one to love you girl
I got u baby cause lately I’ve been so alone girl
Love is on the way
Too much of sadness no happiness girl it ain't good for you
You want some loving I’m bugging you to come on over
Love is on the way

Chorus:
Love is on the way, Heading straight to you
With a kiss and a hug and so much loving you would even know it’s true
And all of your yesterdays, would seem so far away
Love is on the way

Girl I’m taking the time to tell you that no one else could love you more
This is it girl, I’m here to stay and that’s for sure
Love is on the way
You never thought you would ever find someone that you could adore
I admit girl I love you babe and that’s for sure
Love is on the way

With a kiss and a hug and so much loving you would even know it’s true
And all of your yesterdays would seem so far away
Girl you know that my love is always here for you, baby know this love is true
And all of your yesterdays would seem so far away
Love is on the way
