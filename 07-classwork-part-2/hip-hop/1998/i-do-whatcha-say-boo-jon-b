So whatcha say boo
If I asked what you say
I do I do I do
What you say boo
If I asked whatyou say
I do I do I do
They said it wasn't gonna last
They said we're gonna split up fast
They told you
I was a player and i would play you
Nobody wanted us to be this way
Just jealous in the lies they say
Could never touch us 'cause the truth is lady
That I'm still with you
I'm sayin' you're my boo
So whatcha say boo
If I asked what you say
I do I do I do
What you say boo
If I asked what you say
I do I do I do
Been together for some time
Got to tell you what's been on my mind
Since we've been spending every night the way we do
You see I never wanna leave
And if I asked would you believe
I never want to spend the night with anyone but you baby
So whatcha say boo
If I asked what you say
I do I do I do
What you say boo
If I asked what you say
I do I do I do
Say I do, say I do, say I do, say I do
So whatcha say boo
If I asked what you say
I do I do I do
What you say boo
If I asked what you say
I do I do I do
Say I do, love you too
Baby I'm yours it's only you
If I asked would you say I do
Ooh I do, I love you too
Baby I'm yours it's only you
If I asked would you say I do
So whatcha say boo
If I asked what you say
I do I do I do
What you say boo
If I asked what you say
I do I do I do
