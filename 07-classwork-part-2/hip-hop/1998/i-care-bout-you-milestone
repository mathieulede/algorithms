[Verse 1: JoJo]
Sometimes I feel so alone. I call your heart
But there's no one at home. Taking a toll on my pride
I'm reaching out but there's no one inside

[Verse 2: Kevon Edmonds]
You know it doesn't feel right, when I look
In your eyes. I know love is blind, but the
Heart doesn't lie. I'll ask one more time
Maybe this time you'll try. So tell me girl
What's deep in your heart

[Hook: All]
Girl, i care about you. I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me like I care about you?
Girl, I care about you. I'm there for you
So why don't you care for me like I care about you?

[Verse 3: Melvin Edmonds]
I spend like all of my days trying to cess out
Just how things got this way. I thought that we were
In love. But, I swear right now I don't know what
You want

[Verse 4:K-Ci]
I make sure that I give you quality time
But, lately I feel you're not home by design
But still Im gon' try to give you the love of my life
In hopes that you will open up your heart

[Hook]

[Bridge: Kevon & K-Ci]
Sometimes (sometimes i'm not) I'm not sure that
(Im all you've got) That i'm all you've got
(Sometimes i'm not) Sometimes i'm not sure if you
Love me, or not (babe)
Just one thing i know, girl i care for you
And the one thing that i want is that you care for me too

[Hook x2]
