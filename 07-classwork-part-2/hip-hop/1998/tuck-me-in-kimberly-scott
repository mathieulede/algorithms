Ooh, hoo, hoo
Oh, hey

[Verse 1:]
After spending my whole weekend
Kicking back with all my friends
Think my battery has run out
But I fight to raise my hand

And I get a little nervous
Watching day turn into night
Read another bedtime story
Before you turn out the light

[Chorus:]
Tuck me in
And hold me real right
That`s the only way I`ll know
Everything is gonna be alright

Tuck me in
Before you tell me goodnight
That`s the only way I`ll know
Everything is gonna be just fine

[Verse 2:]
You wonder why I get so nervous
Wonder why I get so scared
Friend of mine I used to hang with
Has an address way up there

She was minding her own business
Trying to have herself a little fun
And she never knew what hit her
She never saw tomorrow come

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
And I wake up in the middle
In the middle of the night
I just can`t sleep
So I hold my pillow tight

Counting backwards from a hundred
Only get to ninety-nine
When I call out to you
Tuck me in one more time

[Chorus:]
Tuck me in
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light
(Won`t you)

Tuck me in
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light

Tuck me in
(Tuck me in, yeah)
And hold me real right
(Oh, no, no, no, no, ohâ€¦)
That`s the only way I`ll know
(No, no, no, no)
Everything is gonna be alright
(No, no)

Tuck me in
(Where`s my ring? Yeah)
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light

Tuck me in
Hold me tight
Don`t let go until the morning light
(Tuck me in)

Tuck me in
Hold me tight
