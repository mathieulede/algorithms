(All right yeah eh yeah m mm)This little girl didn't care what anybody said
She got the whole world dancing to the music in her head (yeah)
They loved to trash her bad, laugh at her and call her names (oh yeah)
And now they all try to copy her, isn't that a shame (mm oh)
It only made her stronger

Don't stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it, get out there and
Dont stop, stop the music
People keep on dancing, you can do it
Baby come on oh
Baby come on come on

He knew that he was different
This sucker couldn't win
They didn't dig his vision
They tried to fit him in
But there's no room for losers
Until they make you change
And then you love them
Tell me how much longer...

Dont stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it, get out there and
Dont stop, stop the music
People keep dancing, you can do it
Baby come on
Baby come on (mm)

You've got a perfect mind, you've got a perfect smile
You're unlike anybody, got your own shine, come on

If you just keep on dancing, then you won't feel no pain
Baby it's your decision, only you can break a chaaaaaaaaaaaaaain

Music like love floating in the air
You can reach out grab it everywhere
Show you you're special loved
You were put here on earth to make goodness for people
Better make it worth living while the world still spinning

Dont stop, stop the music
The world will keep turning if you use it, get out there and
Dont stop, stop the music
People keep on dancing, you can do it (Keep on dancing)
Baby come on

Dont stop, stop the music
People keep dancing, you can do it
Baby come on
