Yeah kelly
You there
Now listen baby

I'm just confused

[mr biggs says ()]

(kelly)
See i was the one
Who picked her up when so called friends let her down (un uh)
And i was the one
Who took in when that fool put her out (i know)
A true friend indeed
You see i was there when chips was going down (you know i know)
But she betrayed me
Caught him with her coming in from outta town (you what)

Chorus:
Tell me why (oh shit, why)
Why yi yi (4x) i wanna know
Why yi yi (4x)

(why baby ... i ought to get something over there, ooh)

(kelly)
Now i put my trust in him
I can't believe he slept with her behind my back (oh oh)
I went out on a limb
I even covered up to keep this thing in tact (yeah)
What i had in me
Was something real that's so hard to come about (oh oh oh)
But he betrayed me
There was photos and some laundry that i found

Tell me why(oh oh why)
Why yi yi (4x)
I put all my trust in you baby (ooh why)
Why yi yi (4x)

She was my best friend, ooh yeah yeah, ooh yeah yeah
Come with me through thick and thin, my homie, my homie
Sisters to the very end and i
I can't believe it, can't believe, can't believe it no no
He meant everything to me, everything to me
But out the door he's history
We could've had everything
I can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it

Mr. biggs

Be what you wanted me to be
She was a leaf in your life
I was the root to your tree
