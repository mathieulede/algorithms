Bounce if you want to bounce, ball if you want to ball
Play if you want to play, floss if you want to floss
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
We get ill if you want to ill, smoke if you want to smoke
Kill if you want to kill, loc if you want to loc
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
Yeah, I need a ho in my life to blow on my dice
So we can make our point twice and skate out a town
I need that glow in my eyes, E-Class
Ladies screamin', "Jigga", you know we ease that
Flowin' out like Jees-ass
Jay-Z and me holdin' the mic
So when you like, you find MC's so impolite
And me, I'm so into nice, got cats on the corner niche
Don't me and Jigga be flowin' alike?
Nah, not in your life ain't nobody copin' like Mr. Jay-Z
Shit you're crazy
I'm hot like the six maybe, deep dish with the great seats
I flow greater than your navigator, I drop in your town
Block your data
Pimps all comin' through with a hot pair gators
And a crew with rocks the size of craters
Can't touch like hot potatoes, ya heard?
Now we can bounce if you want to bounce, ball if you want to
Ball
Play if you want to play, floss if you want to floss
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
We get ill if you want to ill, smoke if you want to smoke
Kill if you want to kill, loc if you want to loc
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
In the middle of the war rockin' a vest
Who's the illest shorty alive, I confess
I take nine to the chest and I swear to the heaven sky's
I bless the mics until the day I rest
Till they can feel what I feel, I'ma try my best
And if you real like I real, you can provide the rest
Everything left out, you can blame it on the brain, not the
Heart
I'm playing my part, stretched out, just about the best out
Any nigga realer than me is in a messhall with their chest
Out
Any rapper with less clout, sell more records than me
We extort them as soon as they record 'em, bleek
My name is clear, back when a shorty used to braid my hair
On the project stairs, once I drop to a ceaser, ma, I don't
Need ya
From the block to the hot two-seaters
Gee and we could bounce if you want to bounce, ball if you
Want to ball
Play if you want to play, floss if you want to floss
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
We get ill if you want to ill, smoke if you want to smoke
Kill if you want to kill, loc if you want to loc
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, check
On the two jewels, I blew more money than Latrell, who else?
They don't know you, they think they know you too well, you
Jell
Like Flubber, I hover above the city in a private jet, the
Livest set
Press your brakes, Feds wanna investigate
Mr. I don't cop nothin' less than eight
And anything involved with my name
Regardless of the fame, it's hard
I can't even walk through Harlem again
Charge it to the game, I'm platinum like American Express
My boy died and all I did was inherit his stress
To make every jam tougher, you ain't my man, fuck ya
I suggest let you live, right? Negative, I swear, it's dough
Or die
Hope your soul provides you with a afterlife, close your
Casket tight
Take your last two deep breaths and pass the mic to Jay-Z
Nigga
That's right
Now we could bounce if you want to bounce, ball if you want
To ball
Play if you want to play, floss if you want to floss
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
We get ill if you want to ill, smoke if you want to smoke
Kill if you want to kill, loc if you want to loc
It's alright, you heard? It's alright, holla back
We could bounce if you want to bounce, ball if you want to
Ball
Play if you want to play, floss if you want to floss
It's alright, you heard? It's alright
We get ill if you want to ill, smoke if you want to smoke
Kill if you want to kill, loc if you want to loc
It's alright, you heard them? It's alright and holla back
