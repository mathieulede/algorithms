[Intro]
And so it was written, and after all these things
I saw another angel come down from heaven
Having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory
And he cried mightily with a strong voice saying
"Babylon the great has fallen
Has fallen and has become the habitation of devils
And the home to every foul spirit
And a cage of very unclean, and hateful men"

[Verse 1]
What you see is what you get now
Xzibit never wait around for no kickdown, got my own shit loud
Shot heard around the world
Uplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple
To make things simple, my existence is a ripple through time
Only concerned with what is mine, divine
Never monkeyshine, walkin down a very thin line
Holdin heat, runnin crazy in the streets, yeah (What's up?)
Plus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep
Don't wanna see none of this evil I speak
Around the atlas, cume la matra, the super actress
You all get close-lined and pinned to the mattress
All day, every day, every which way
Who said you can't have your cake and eat it too (Fuck you!)
This is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it's worth
Xzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this

[Bridge]
Players, pimps, hoes, hustlers
Willies, thugs, ballers, busters
Gangstas, macks, everyday, all day
Shot callers, even high rollers keep it moving

[Hook]
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wild
Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit

[Verse 2]
You got more than you bargained for; hit the floor
I pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black
Take your breath like an asthma attack
Just a slave like Flavor Flav, "You're blind to the facts"
Mr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee
Guaranteed to bring the house down naturally
Niggas knowin No Limits like Master P
Makin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?)
A whole different breed of MC; realize it's you against me
Catch a three-hundred and sixty degree
Roundhouse to the mouth right
And like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright
I feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red
Cause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread
Niggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead
Came crashin through the door like the Feds, bring it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The year everybody start to rush
Swingin through is your friendly neighborhood lush
I crack your bottle then watch how Xzibit bust
I regulate like a killer with a nickel plate, I set it straight
Start to shakin you down, breakin new ground, construction work
Heavy artillery, put your dick in the dirt
Stay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt
Slug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt
Get cut from the belly up (What?)
I break the chain, fast lane, suck my sugar cane
I'm tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things
Material things, protected by the underground kings
Who rule the land with an iron fist
The Men in Black, if we flash can't remember shit (Sorry)
You cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam
Cause my package came short twelve grams, get the picture?

[Bridge] + [Hook]
