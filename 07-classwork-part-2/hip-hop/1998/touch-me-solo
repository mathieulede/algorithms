[Verse 1]
I was seated by myself
And you came
You asked me to hold your hand again
You told me if I'm nice
We would be together
So I'm doing my best
But we're not
You told me if I'm nice
We would be together
And you would be nice too[x3]

[Chorus]
But don't you touch me
Cause it means so much to me

[Verse 2]
I stayed pure as a dove for you my love
But you are a werewolf
Aren't you my love
And I soon realize that it's not a game
To find the soul-mate of your life
I soon realize that it's not worth the gamble
Cause I always lose[x3]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let's not pretend
To be just friends
And don't hold my hand again
Don't break my heart again

[Outro]
Is there
A place
Where I can rest
Without you in my head
