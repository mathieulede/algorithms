[Featuring Xscape And Keith Sweat]
Am I dreaming baby?
Are you for real?
Things are kind of hazy
And my head's all cloudy inside (Inside)
Now I've heard talk of angels, baby
But never though I would have one to call mine
(Never thought)
See you are just too good to be true
And I hope
There's not some kinda mirage
With you, oh baby
1-Am I dreaming
Am I just imagining you're here in my life
Am I dreaming
Pinch me to see if it's real
Cuz my mind can't decide
Cuz my mind can't decide
No, no, no, no, no, oh
Will this last for one night
Or do I have you for all time
Please say that it's forever
And that it's not an illusion to my eye
And I, I hope
That you just don't up and disappear
My love I pray
That it's not a hoax and it's for real, oh
(rpt 1)
Hear me out now
Sometimes say that sometimes
I need you to show me girl
(oh baby, I need you)
Show me that you're not a mirage
(I need you)
I need you
Oh, I need you to pinch me baby
I need you to pinch me baby
Am I
Am I dreaming
Am I just imagining you're here in my life
Am I dreaming
Pinch me to see if it's real
Cuz my mind can't decide
