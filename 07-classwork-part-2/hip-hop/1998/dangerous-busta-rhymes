[Verse 1]
Buck wild for all of my people who don't care
Lost like a bunch of black millionaires
Makin ya run, me and my gun
Stackin my ones
Floss a little, invest up in a mutual fund
Blowin the horn since of everyday I was born
Never dreamed Iâ€™d see a nigga landscaping my lawn
Dangerous, my niggas shit be accurate
Have to get, the flow be so immaculate
A yo a yo I do my deal sippin my moet
Sippin' it slow, them pretty bitches sayin hello
Any wiggle hittin this playa, Oil of Olay
Little honey dipped in within her little cabriolet
I don't mean to hold you up
But I got somethin to say
Swear to only give you hot shit everyday
Afraid of us, you know this ain't no game to us
You strange to us
That's when we gettin dangerous

[Hook]
This is serious
We can make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
Cause to much of us is dangerous
So dangerous we dangerous
My Flipmode squad is dangerous
So dangerous we dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous

[Verse 2]
Hold your breath
We swing it from right to left
Word to Wyclef
You know my shit be hot to death
Staying alive, you know only the stronger survive
Holding my heat
I love my seat , wippin the five
Baseline for all of my people movin around
Give me a pound
All of my niggas holdin it down
Cuttin' you up
The new shit wrekin you up
Blowin you up
My black hole suckin you up
Back in the days brother use to be assed out
Now a brother holdin several money market accounts
Blaze the street and then I would just like to announce
Feelin my grove
My jiga jiga makin you bounce
Others is fare, me and my squad breakin the bread
Straight gettin it, we got you suckers holdin your head
Afraid of us, you know this ain't no game to us
You strange to us that's when we gettin dangerous

[Hook]
This is serious
We can make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
Cause too much of us is dangerous
So dangerous we dangerous
My Flipmode squad is dangerous
So dangerous we dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous

One time ya'll
Throw your hands real high ya'll
Yea, get down ya'll
Let me see you all ya'll
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode ya'll
Nineteen ninety eight ya'll
Ha, get down ya'll, lets have a ball ya'll

[Verse 3]
Feelin the heat up in the street rockin the beat
Step up in the club, take me to my reserved seat
Comin around, all of my people surround me
So much bottles of liquor, ya'll brothers will drown me
Makin ya drunk, feelin the fun, blazin the skunk
Stay hitten with the shit that blow a hole in ya trunk
Afraid of us, you know this ain't no game to us
You strange to us that's when we gettin dangerous

[Hook]
This is serious
We can make you delirious
You should have a healthy fear of us
Cause too much of us is dangerous
So dangerous we dangerous
My Flipmode squad is dangerous
So dangerous we dangerous
My whole entire unit is dangerous
