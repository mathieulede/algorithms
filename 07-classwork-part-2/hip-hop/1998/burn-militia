Well let's burn until the sun burns your eye
& keep burnin' 'til it sets on the Westside
Just ride & stay high all night
Let's just ride & stay high all night

Devious:
It's late night where the sun rest
Flick your Bics let's get lit man
I'm dressin' up this trick
Ms. Philly she got big plans
With a few bags of do bad
She the bomb when you hit it
'cause you glad to get blasted like Manson
Knowin' Mr. Dutchmaster burn faster
But Big Daddy done turned into a bastard
So I'm no kin to Father Time when I'm smokin'
Who said trees couldn't grow dollar signs
No bought it by the lines
'til tomorrow shine coast to coast
Blow the smoke go for broke
Get yours split yours
& keep sippin' fifths 'til ya pis poor
& if ya can't handle this
Still could hit the floor
It's strictly herb in the chest cavity
So we high to defy all the laws of gravity
Rapidly when I come down like avalanches
I look the streets in search for free weed advances

Chorus
Well let's burn until the sun burns your eyes
& keep burnin' 'til it sets on the Westside
Just ride & stay high all night
Let's just ride & stay high all night

Now burn until the sun burns your eye
& keep burnin' 'til it sets on the Westside
Just ride & stay high all night
Let's just ride & stay high all night

Swisher Sweets Phillie Blunts Dutchmasters
Vega Papers man they keep me blasted
And I blast one or two for my revenue if I have to
For now it's top bangin' strictly smokin' & drankin'
And mighty thought thinkin'
& paper chasin' Ben Franklins
Lizards on my twos with G-Strings & nipple rings
Cigarrellas split open rollin' icky sticky lime green
High mean of high ?? to raise the limit to keep
Burnin' Spinach 'til the moonlight diminish
Still blazin' one nigga who ain't never too faded
Let me explain it the rage man
They babble it's street babble
Smoke herb & rearrange words together like Scrabble
Grab yo' E & J yo' Hennessaay yo' Presidentaay
A zip of bombay & all y'all come with me
And just ride & stay high all night
Let's just ride & stay high all night

Chorus
Now burn until the sun burns your eyes
& keep burnin' 'til it sets on the Westside
Just ride & stay high all night
Let's just ride & stay high all night

Now burn until the sun burns your eye
& keep burnin' 'til it sets on the Westside
Just ride & stay high all night
Let's just ride & stay high all night

Let's ride & stay high all night
Let's just ride & stay high all night

Devious:
We keep it lit y'all
But don't you get crossed up like ya bitch bra
If y'all switch & get crossed
& the senses gettin' quick to split y'all
& make y'all collapse flat
Like Hank Gathers at the free throw
No dis but when the weed grows
We roll the whole lawn
& blow 'til the break of dawn
So it's all beneficial
An Ill Mind with a twisted thought
It's official
Diz [overlapping]
You're cordially invited to a all-nighter
OG's be ?'in on seeds E & J & apple cider
Turn the lights down & get yo' lighters up
Pour up a cup & get fucked up

Outro: [Diz & Devious]
