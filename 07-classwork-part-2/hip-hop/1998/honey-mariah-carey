[Intro]
Uh, uh, honey got me hooked on you
I like that, ooh, ooh
(Come on, MC) La, la, la, la
(Come on) La, la, la, la (MC)
La, la, la, la, la, la (I like that)
(Let's go)

[Verse 1]
Honey, you can have me when you want me
Just simply ask me to be there (a huh)
And you're the only one who makes me come running
Because what you got is far beyond compared

[Pre-Hook]
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me (that's right)
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

[Hook]
It's like honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, crying for you, I adore you
Boy, you know your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe how good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe how good it feels inside

[Verse 2]
I can't be elusive with you honey (I like that)
Because it's blatant that I'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
You're the only thing I wanna do

[Pre-Hook]
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh, baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey

[Hook]
It's like honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, crying for you, I adore you
(I need you, babe)
Boy, you know your love addicted me
(Boy, your love addicted me)
And I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day (I be waiting for your love)
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Baby, I can love you, babe
(Tell the world we won't stop)
(And Mariah, you're on fire)
Got to hold on love thy saints
(Tell the world we won't stop)
(So, Mariah, take us higher)
(Tell the world we won't stop)
(And Mariah, you're on fire)
(Tell the world we won't stop)
(So, Mariah, take us higher)

[Bridge]
Breakdown
Uh, uh, every little thing you do
(Now what we going to do right here)
(We going to smooth it out, come on)
Uh, uh, honey, got me hooked on you
(MC, and she won't stop)
Honey, it's like

[Hook]
It's like honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, crying for you, I adore you
(Boy, I need your love, right now, baby)
Boy, you know your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
It's like honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, crying for you, I adore you
Boy, you know your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
It's like honey when it rushes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet (that's right)
And I'm dying for you, crying for you, I adore you
Boy, you know your love addicted me
And I'm strung out on you, darling, don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe...
