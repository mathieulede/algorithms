[Intro]
Come on now
Oh'oh'ho'ho'oh'
Here we, here we, here we go again
Well, boy

[Verse 1]
I caught you slipping (Mmm), ooh, you must be tripping
'Cause now I know, oh, yes I know, mmm
About your other girls in your past, in your black book
A very long time ago, oh'ho'ho'
Well, you must think I'm crazy
You must think I'm blind
If you want to keep me, boy
Then stop wasting my time

[Chorus]
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking yo are going to do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door

[Verse 2]
All this time (All this time) I thought that I (I)
Was the one who had the problem, oh'yeah'mmm'
I gave you everything, hoping things might change
But still you ain't around, so, whoa'oh'oh'
You must think I'm foolish (Oh, yeah)
You must think I'm blind (Do you think I'm blind)
If you want (If you want) my precious love (My precious love)
Then stop telling me lies (Stop wasting, wasting my time)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You know I've tried to give you the world
Oh, and everything you need, oh'oh'
Oh, I tried (I') so many times (So many times)
You still mistreated me, oh, here we go

[Chorus][x4]

[Outro]
Yeah, baby, oh'oh'
