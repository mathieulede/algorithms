Voice: You know there comes a period in every womans life when
She gets frustrated or fed up with her man and all his silly hangups
You know a woman wants a man where she dont have to have no drama
Behind it You know jus somebody like to love her down with
No strings attached and his name is "Splackavellie"

Tell me what kind of superman
Would take u in his bedroom baby
And hit u with some front back and side to side
Like hydrolics on a stormy night
And break u off sumthin proper like
Ain't no need fo u to perpertrate
Cause he will accomadate
And u will aprecciate tha way he flips u up down and round and round
In and out and make u scream and shout
Shortie put your thang down down down

[Bridge]
He ain't ya boyfriend
He ain't ya husband
Just sumbody u can call when your body needs a fix
He'll put u in tha mix
Den youll hear him askin whats my name say my name
Splackavellie

[Hook]
Every woman needs here own Splackavellie
A brotha she can call when her man ain't doin her right
He can work it all night
Until tha morning light
Make her feel right right right
Every woman needs that one Splackavellie
A brotha she can call when her man ain't doin her right
He can work it all night
Until tha morning light
Make her feel right right right

Tell me what kind of superman
Would make u feel good with his mouth
And kiss u from your earring to your bellychain
Then go down a little further mayn
Its allright baby ain't no shame
Drop tha top on his Mercades Benz
So her legs can feel tha wind
As he hits again and again and again Its all good yeah
Because Im bout it bout it baby im bout it bout it baby
