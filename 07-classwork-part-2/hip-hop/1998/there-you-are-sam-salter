Like a candle with a flame
That never dies
Through the good and bad
You've been by my side
And when the world outside
Is feeling so unkind
You were there to pick me up
Oh, how i need your smile

(CHORUS):
Whenever I fall
There you are
I know that my pain
You feel in your heart
And when the life that I live
Seems so hard
There you are

Even though you're far away
I can still see you

Sometimes I swear you're still
Inside my mind
Tell me you are the shadow
That always follows me
You always seem to be right there
You're like an angel by my side

Repeat chorus

Unconditional loving
Is what you've given me
Your heart is all that I want to know
Forever in you I have a home
I'll stay by your side
Cause you are the light
In my heart
And in my life
Oh whenever i look
And there you are
