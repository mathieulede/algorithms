I can't forget
The way things used to be
Felt so good

You know it ain't always money
But don't it sound funny
Everyday is my day when I'm loving no one

Hook 1
Is it reality
To think true love was made for me
Cause of the pain I feel
When the phone rings

And I can go on and on and on
You see
But this time could mean
I'm running outta love

When there's no one around
