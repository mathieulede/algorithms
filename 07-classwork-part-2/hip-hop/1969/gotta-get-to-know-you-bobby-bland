I made up my mind
And here's my decision
I'd like to share with you
All of my secrets and my religion

I want you to see
Oh, how sweet I could be
Oh, I just got to get to know you
I just got to get to know you

You got what it takes
Lord, there's no denying
I see in you, a dream come
Lord, You're life to the dying

Looking at you is like a baby dream
Cookies, cake and ice cream
Oh, I just got to get to know you
I just got to get to know you

In my life, there's an empty slot
Lord, I believe You can fill that spot
I just got to get to know you
I just got to get to know you

Blessed are the days I spend with you
Realizing precious moment we never knew
But right now, I'm just imagining this thing
Would you believe the joy you bring, woah

I just got to get to know you
I just got to get to know you
I wanna kiss your lips
