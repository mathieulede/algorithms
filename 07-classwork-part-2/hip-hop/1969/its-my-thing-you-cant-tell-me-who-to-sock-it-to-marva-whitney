[Chorus]
It's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to
It's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to

[Verse 1]
You don't want me to love you
It ain't no big deal
You don't wanna leave me man
It ain't no big deal
I don't need love
As for as you
Make me no difference
Who you sock it to

[Chorus 2]
It's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to
It's my thing

[Bridge]
I'm got hurt
For your love
Oh it's pathetic baby
I gotta be on alert
I'll do anything
Anything I choose
I just can't be at the window
Stopped for you

[Chorus 3]
It's your thing, my thing
That I want to do
You can't tell me
Who to sock it to
It's my thing
I can do what I wanna do
You can't tell me, no
Who to sock it to
