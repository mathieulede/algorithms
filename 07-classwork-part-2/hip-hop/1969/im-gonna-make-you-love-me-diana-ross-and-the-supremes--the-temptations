I'm gonna do all the thing for you
A girl wants a man to do
Oh, baby
I'll sacrifice for you
I'll even do wrong for you
Oh, baby
Every minute, every hour
I'm gonna shower you
With love and affection
Look out, it's comin' in your direction
And I'm, I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will, yes I will
I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will, yes I will
Look here , my love is strong, you see
I know you'll never get tired of me
Oh, baby
And I'm gonna use every trick in the book
I'll try my best to get you hooked
Hey, baby
And every night, every day, I'm gonna say
I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you
Look out boy, 'cause I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will, yes I will
And I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will, you know I will
Every breathe I take
And each and every step I make
Brings me closer, baby
Closer to you
And with each beat of my heart
For every day we're apart
I'll hunger for every wasted hour
And I
Every night and every day
I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you
Look out, 'cause I'm gonna get you
And I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will, yes I will
I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will, yes I will
I'm gonna make you love me
Oh, yes I will, yes I will
I'm gonna make you love me
Yes I will, yes I will
