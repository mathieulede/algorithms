Just one moment, I like to be
Is for you to say to me
Say you love me, say you love me

Say you love me, say you love me

Just to see you, and to hear ya
Your voice alone
And with your company
Knowing that our love is strong
Just these few things, my dear
You don't know what they mean to me
For your precious love
It means everything to me

And darling, all of my life I've wanted this
All of my life, love and happiness
And then you came along
And made my loneliness disolve
And that's why I'm saying

And as long as you, as long as you
Say you love me, say you love me
Say that you love me, that you love me
I'll keep on singin'
(Keep on singin', keep on singin')
As long as you say you love me
I've got to just keep on singin' for ya, baby

Woo hoo, just say you love me
(Say you love me, say you love me)
