(R. Dunbar/E. Wayne)

How long can I go on amusing myself
Night after night sitting all alone
While you're in the arms of someone else
Now don't you know that

While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and gone
While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and gone
You just buzz, buzz, buzz here and there
Spreadin' your love (everywhere)

You think you're the sugar ole daddy with a candy kiss
You think without your love, I can't exist
Don't think for a minute 'cause I'm true
And don't want nobody here but you

Oh, while you're out looking for sugar
One day somebody's gonna take your honey and gone

How long can I be faithful?
Truly, I don't know
But if I find myself in the arms of someone else
Darling, it's all your fault

How long can I go on amusing myself
Night after night sitting all alone
While you're in the arms of someone else
Now don't you know that

While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and gone
While you're out looking for sugar
One day somebody's gonna take your honey and gone
Buzz, buzz, buzz here and there
You just spreadin' your love (Everywhere) everywhere

Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba
Oooh ooh
Oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba

From another woman's door you come sneakin'
Back to my door you come creepin'
You're sneakin' across the floor with your shoes in your hands
How much more do you think I can stand?

While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and gone
While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and gone

While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and gone
While you're out looking for sugar
Somebody's gonna take your honey and gone

While you're out looking for sugar
One day somebody's gonna take your honey and gone
