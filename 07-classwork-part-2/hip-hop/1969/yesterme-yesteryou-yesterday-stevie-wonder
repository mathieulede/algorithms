[Intro]
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday

[Verse 1]
What happened to the world we knew
When we would dream and scheme
And while the time away
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday

[Chorus]
Where did it go that yester glow
When we could feel
The wheel of life turn our way
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday

[Verse 2]
I had a dream so did you life
Was warm and love was true
Two kids who followed all the rules
Yester folls and now

[Chorus]
Now it seems those yester dreams
Were just a cruel
And foolish game we used to play
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday

[Bridge]
When I recall what we had
I feel lost I feel sad with nothing but
The memory of yester love and now
Now it seems those yester dreams
Were just a cruel
And foolish game we had to play

[Outro]
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday[x2]
Sing with me
Yesterme yesteryou yesterday
One more time
