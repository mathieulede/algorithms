[Hook]
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I went for a walk
On a winters day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in LA
California dreamin'
On such a winters day

[Verse 1]
Went through the church, just me
I stopped along the way
When I got down on my bended knee
And I began to pray
You know the preacher digs a call
Cuz he knows I'm gonna stay
He knows I'm gonna stay, I told him so
California dreamin'

[Bridge]
Oh, somebody hit me now
I wanna go so bad, yeah

[Hook]
Cos all the leaves are brown
And the skies are gray, yeah
I went for a walk
On a winter's day, oooh !
I'd be safe and warm
If i was in LA
California dreamin'
On such a winter's day
Such a winter's day
On such a winter's day, yeah, yeah, woah !

[Outro]
California dreamin
California dreamin
Gotta, gotta, gotta get some sunshine
Can't believe i blew my mind
Gotta get some sunshine
California dremaing
California dremaing
Ohhh, gotta get some
California dreamin, ohhhhhh
California dreamin
Gotta get to LA
Get some sunshine every day
California dreamin
Ohh...........
