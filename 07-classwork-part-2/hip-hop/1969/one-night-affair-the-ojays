Hey, wine me and dine me
Take me in a way I wanna go
But when the night is over
You just may not see me no more

All I want is a one night affair
That won't hurt nobody
A night affair

Hit and run, gonna be a son of a gun
Hit and run, but it could be fun

I don't wanna love nobody
Don't want us get anything
I just may not be ready
To fly down with a wedding ring

All I want is a one night affair, you're right
A one night affair and that's started one

Hit and run
Hit and run, could be fun

I have been a lonely woman
Oh, try understand

All I want is a one night affair
Sounds in a hurry
A one night affair
But you don't have to worry

I'll hit and run
And I know you been lonely too
That's why you understand
A broken heart's so hard on a woman

One of these days I'll be alright
If you just let me love you tonight
It may sound a little temporary
Sometimes I feel it's so necessary

I said a one night affair, well, I do declare
A one night affair, won't hurt nobody

Hit and run, gonna be a son of a gun
Hit and run, could be fun
Hit and run, son of a gun
Could be fun

A one night affair
Sounds in a hurry
A one night affair
But don't you worry

Hit and run, gonna be a son of a gun
Hit and run, it maybe fun

A one night affair
A one night affair this time tonight

Hit and run, gonna be a son of a gun
Hey, 'cause it could be fun
