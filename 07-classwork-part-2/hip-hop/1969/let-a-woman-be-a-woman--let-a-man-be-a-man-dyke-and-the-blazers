Some people say now
Living in a joke, ha
People said, yes, they did
Country's going up in smoke

I got a message
They need to know
Gotta let a woman be a woman
And let a man be a man
Gotta let a woman be a woman
And let a man be a man

Listen
Some people call me
Broadway Tramp now
They even said, yes, they did
I had no place to stay

Listen
Cause I hung around now
Down on Broadway

Gotta let a woman be a woman
And let a man be a man, ha
Gotta let a woman be a woman
And let a man be a man

But listen, dig it now
Some people don't like
The way Sally walks

Gotta let a woman be a woman
And let a man be a man
Gotta let a woman be a woman
And let a man be a man

Listen, get off my back
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
And that woman too

Talk about something, yeah
Gonna benefit you...
