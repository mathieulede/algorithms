Baby, I like what you're doing to me
I'm all messed up now
Baby, I like what you're doing to me

Your mama called you no good
And like most other men I see
You can't be true, it ain't in you
And it's no secret to me

But when you hold me in your arms
You're like ten good men wrapped in one
Baby, I like what you're doing to me
Baby, if I like what you're doing to me

You're just like your old daddy
They say he didn't treat your mama right
I'm not downing you for what you do
But the truth shall give the light

You're like Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde
But, oh, how you keep me satisfied
Baby, I like what you're doing to me
Baby, I like what you're doing to me

You make me feel all right now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

You're like Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde
But, oh, how you keep me satisfied
Baby, I like what you're doing to me
Though you're no good
Baby, I like what you're doing to me

Oh, I like what you're doing
You make me feel so good
Baby, you make me feel so good
I like, I like, I like what you're doing
I like, I like, I like what you're doing

You make me feel so good
You make me feel so good, baby
