I get the feeling that you really miss me
Oh, I love you when you hug and kiss me
And look at me like I'm buggin' you honey
Girl, I can't stand it when you start acting funny
Oh moody woman you change like the weather
Moody woman but you got it together
Moody, moody, moody woman I love you
Oh variety is the spice of life

Yes the pain makes the pleasure nice
You bet your life I do
You make my day when you say you need me
But that's no way to play when you say you're gonna leave me
Moody woman, oh I love you
Moody woman I think the world of you
Moody, moody, moody woman I love you

You bet your life I do
You know you can girl

Oh baby you could be impossibly smart
But I know you love me
You think the world of me
And you got a great big heart

People tell me that love's blind
There ain't no love as blind as mine
And though I have to suffer when you're feeling blue
Oh moody woman I know all about you
My life would be much tougher if I didn't have you
Moody woman can't live without you

Moody, moody, moody woman I love you
You bet your life I do
Oh moody woman yo know I love you
Moody woman I don't want to leave you
Moody woman I think the world of you
You have been my whole life
Why don't you let me love you Moody baby you know that I need you
