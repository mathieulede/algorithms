[Verse 1]
I pulled into Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
Hey, mister, can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?
(can you tell me)
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No," was all he said

[Chorus]
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, and, and, and put the weight on me

[Verse 2]
I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown
She said, "Well I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around

[Chorus]
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, and, and, and

[Verse 3]
Go down, Moses, there's nothing that you can say
It's just like all Luke waiting, waiting on Judgement Day
Well, Luke, my friend, what about Anna Lee?
He said, Do me a favor, stay an' keep Anna Lee some company

[Chorus]
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, and, and, and put the weight on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
Catch me a cannon ball, now take me on down the line
My bag is sinking low, and I believe that it's about time
To get in touch with Annie, you know she's the one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone?

[Chorus]
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
