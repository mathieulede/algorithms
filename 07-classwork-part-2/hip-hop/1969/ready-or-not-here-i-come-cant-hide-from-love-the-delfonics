[Verse]
Ready or not here I come
You can't hide, gonna find you
And keep you happy
Ready or not here I come
You can't hide, gonna love you
And make you love me

[Chorus 1]
You can't run away
From this love I got, oh baby (hey baby)
'Cause I got a lot, yeah
Anywhere you go
My poor heart's gotta know
Baby, hey, baby
You can't hide from love, no

[Verse]
Ready or not here I come
You can't hide, gonna find you
And keep you happy
Ready or not here I come
You can't hide, gonna love you
And make you love me

[Chorus 2]
Anywhere you go
My poor heart's gotta know
Baby, hey, baby
You can't hide from love, no

[Verse]
Ready or not here I come
You can't hide, gonna find you
And keep you happy
Ready or not here I come
You can't hide...
