If I were a rich man, yeah
I'd spend every dime
Just to prove to you
That I want you to be mine
If I were a poet
I'd write lots of beautiful poems
The world would come
Crawlin after my poems
To express my love to you darlin'
Oh but I
I'm an average guy
And I don't know how to show you, show you
I'm an average guy
And I don't know how to tell you, tell you
That I love you
That I love you
If I were a beggar
I would spend out a cold night everyday
And I would get down on my knees
And I'd beg for the right words to say, yeah yeah
If I were a clown
I'd paint me a real sad face
Oh just to get your attention darlin'
Just seein' maybe
Maybe you will look my way
Oh
But I
I'm an average guy
And I don't know how to show you, show you
I'm an average guy
And I don't know how to tell you, tell you
That I love you
That I love you
I said
I'm an average guy
And I don't know how to show you, show you
I'm an average guy
And I don't know how to tell you, tell you
That I love you
That I love you
That I love you
That I love you
