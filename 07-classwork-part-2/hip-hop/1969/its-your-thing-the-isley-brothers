[Chorus]
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to

[Verse 1]
If you want me to love you, maybe I will
Believe me woman, it ain't no big deal
You need love now, just as bad as I do
Make's me no difference now, who you give your thing to

[Chorus]
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to

[Chorus]
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to

[Verse 2]
I'm not trying to run your life
I know you wanna do what's right
Give your love now, to whoever you choose
How can you lose, with the stuff you use now

[Chorus]
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to

[Chorus]
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
It's your thing, do what you wanna do
I can't tell you, who to sock it to
