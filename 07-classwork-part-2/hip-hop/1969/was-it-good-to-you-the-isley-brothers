You made a fool out of someone
(Out of someone)
You thought love was true
And found out that you were just having fun
(Just having fun)

And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After all, I've been good to you
(I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have

And I recall the time
You needed somebody and I made you mine
You needed a friend
So I took you in and treated you so kind

And oh, why do you wanna make me blue?
After after all, I've been good to you
(I've been good to you)
Oh, yes I have

And you know I've always been around
And I never, never, never let you down
And now you're telling me that you must go
You know that you're hurting me so

But there, there come a time
One day, one day, one day you gonna wake up and find
You'll come back to me on your bending knee
And you're gonna be crying

And oh, believe me, what I say it true, baby
After all, Lord I've been good to you
(I've been good to you)
Everyday and every way
(I've been good to you)

You know, you know, you know, baby
I've been so good
(I've been good to you)

You made a fool out of someone
(Out of someone)
