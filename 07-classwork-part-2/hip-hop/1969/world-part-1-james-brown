World (world) world

World, tell me what
Happened to the blissed
And world, where's
The love we missed

World, tell me what
Happened to the blissed
And world, tell me
Where's the love we missed

I hope you have a change of heart
Cause we can't go on like this

If we can't love our brothers
And we have lost the love for mother
Cause she said never to be apart
And we move ahead and add
Love to our heart

I never thought good people
Could ever, ever fail
And let the wonderful world
Be like a prison jail

World, let all the hearts make up
And let everybody drink
From that silver cup

Tell me, where's the
Love we missed
Because we can't
We can't go on like this

Yeah, but you can't forsee
When we are lost because
Hope is just too far away
And all the work of
Many, many good men
Forsake by the dock of the boy

Hit it
Please, give a damn, hey
Be concerned now

Got to have love, lord
Lord, have mercy

Got to be love
It's all we need
I know it right now

I never thought that people
Would ever, ever fail
And let this wonderful world
Be like a prison jail
