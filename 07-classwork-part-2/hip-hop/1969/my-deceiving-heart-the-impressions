Oh oh I, could die
So hard I'd cry
My deceiving heart
Has torn us apart

I'm here to testify
How all the time
You want me to be so blind

I'm just a fool, within myself
All is gone and there's nothing left
Nothing left for me, but bitterness
Frustrations, lost relation
From my deceiving heart
Oh baby how it's torn us apart

Child well I know, you've been so good to me
And now I see
When I turned my back on you baby
I unintentionally set you free

I wish now with all my heart
I hadn't started
What has taken your love from me
Now I desire all of your fire
That you once gave me so tenderly

But there's nothing left but bitterness
Frustrations, lost relation
From my deceiving heart
Oh baby how it's torn us apart

I wish that I hadn't started
All this pain, what a shame
Oh how it hurts, when you're gone
And the pain still remains

I wish that I hadn't started
Have mercy, all this pain and misery
Oh how it hurts
