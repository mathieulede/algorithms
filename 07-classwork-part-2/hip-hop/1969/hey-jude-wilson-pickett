Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made, made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it better

And any time you feel the pain
Hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulder
For you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
By making the world a little bit colder

Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go out and get her
But remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

So let it out and let it in
Hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you
Hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Just remember to let her under your skin
Then you'll begin to make it better

Hey Jude
Jude, Jude, it's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright Jude
Hey Jude
