[Verse 1]
Ah baby
After many tears fall from your eyes
A thousand times you ask yourself why
The one guy you love has departed
You're left alone and broken-hearted
Love just comes and goes
How long it's going to last nobody knows

[Chorus]
That's the way love is, baby [or honey, or other endearing term]
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's the way love is, baby
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
That's how it is

[Verse 2]
I know you're walking down a lonesome road
And your heart is carrying a heavy load
I know you feel like you haven't got a friend (haven't got a friend)
And your whole world's caving in (caving in)
Ah, but now is the time to be strong (to be strong)
You better forget him now that he's gone (now that he's gone)
Remember[?]

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Listen to me, little darling
The road of love is rough sometimes
But don't let it get the best of you
I've been hurt by love so many times
I know just what you're going through
You wish you were never born
You better forget him now that he's gone

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Wipe away your tears
Love is here today and gone tomorrow
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
All your joys turn to sorrow
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
One day gladness, and the next day sadness
(That's the way love is, sugar, how it is)
[...and fade]
