Hmm, hmm, hmm-mmm
I was raised an only child
My folks died when I was four
They were trapped in a fire
Way up on the fourteenth floor

Well, my lovin' granny raised me
'Til I reached the age of ten
But the good Lord took her too
And left my dog Jeff, my only friend

Oh, baby
Seem like the odds are against me
Nothing works out right for me, ooh

I've lost everything I've ever loved
Honey, honey, now I'm losing you, baby
I've lost everything I've ever, ever loved
Honey, honey, now I'm losing you
Ooh, baby

So, all my love I gave to Jeff
'Cause he was all I had right then
But the wheels of an automobile
Brought his life to a tragic end

From an orphan home to college
Thought I found true love in you
I felt sure we would marry
But your folks did not approve

Oh, baby
Seem like the odds are against me
Nothing works out right for me, ooh

I've lost everything I've ever loved
Now I'm losing you, oh
I've lost everything I've ever loved, baby
Honey, honey, now I'm losing you
Ooh, baby

You accepted their decision
Without any type of defense
They said if we wait a few more years
That would make a little more sense

So we waited three or four
Everyday we kept in touch
But when we came face to face
You didn't love me quite as much

Oh, baby
Seem like the odds are against me
Nothing works out right for me

I've lost everything I've ever loved
Baby, baby, baby, now I'm losin' you
I've lost everything I've ever loved
Now, I'm losin' you
Now, I'm losin' you

I've lost everything I've ever loved
(Every, every, everything, ever)
Now, I'm losin' you
(Honey, now I'm losing you)
