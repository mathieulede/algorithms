You may think I'm silly to love a man twice my age
But I know from experience, girls, sometime with pain
The man I've got, the fire is almost gone
He can't heat up nobody's eyes
He got just enough to keep me warm
I'd rather be an old man's sweetheart
Than to be a young man's fool, oh yeah

To love you once a month is all an old man desires
You can love a young man 7 days a week
And still he's not satisfied
And old man would be so grateful
You could just sit and talk
But a young man is somewhere doing the camel walk
I'd rather be an old man's sweetheart
Than to be a young man's fool, yeah, yeah, yeah

Most girls prefer a young man
'Cause a young man is strong - tell him, let me be
But I'd rather put up with this old man
Than have a young man doing me wrong
And old man would be so grateful - tell him
You could just let him sit and talk - tell him, let me be
But a young man is somewhere busy doing the camel walk
I'd rather be an old man's sweetheart
Than to be a young man's fool

Don't wanna be your fool, no
Don't wanna be your fool
Ain't gonna be your fool
Don't wanna be no fool
Young man, just ain't gonna do that
No no, don't wanna be no fool
Ain't gonna be no fool
