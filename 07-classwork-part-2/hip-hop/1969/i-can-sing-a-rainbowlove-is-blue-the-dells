Red and Yellow and Pink and Green Purple and
Orange and Blue
I can sing a rainbow
(I can sing a rainbow)
I can sing a rainbow too

Blue
Blue, blue my world is blue
Blue is my world now I'm without you

Gray
Gray my life is gray
Hole in my heart since you
(Since you went away)
Ah yeah
Oh yeah

I can sing a rainbow
(I can sing a rainbow)
I can sing a rainbow

Red
Red my eyes are red
Crying for you alone in my bed

Green
So green my jealous heart
I douted you and now
Now we are apart
Ah yeah
Oh yeah

When we met
I've prouded some soul
Then love died
Now the rainbow

Rain

Black
Oh black
The nights I've known
Longing for you
Lost and along
God

The jealous love for you
Blue is my world
Now I'm (hey) (hey) (I said hey)

My world is blue baby

My world is blue baby

So blue
I need you baby
I want you baby
