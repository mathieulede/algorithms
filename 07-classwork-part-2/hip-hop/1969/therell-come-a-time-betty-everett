There'll come a time in every girl's life
She'll have to cry
There'll come a time when the heart
Won't take no more
She'll have to cry, cry, cry, cry
Baby sometimes you see the rich have to cry
The poor have to cry
You got to cry
And I got to cry sometimes
I'll say it again
Rich have to cry
The poor have to cry
You got to cry
I got to cry, oh yeah
Oh love, oh love, oh love
Why you want to go
Away and leave me here to cry
When you know I would miss you
But oh baby, if you'd please
Please come back to me
I apologize, if I ever made you cry
You see the rich have to cry
Poor have to cry
You get to cry
And I got to cry
