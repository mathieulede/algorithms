[Verse 1]
Up drove the Hearse, Cadillac
A crowd of people gathered round all dressed in black
And as they removed her body from the car
Such pain I never knew, did fill my heart

I lost the only one I've ever loved
The Lord has returned her up above
Life will never be the same again
It was the beginning of my end

[Verse 2]
It happened on a Saturday night
My love and I had just had a silly fight
She got into her car and angrily drove away
Neither of us knew then that she'd never see another day

What have I done Lord to deserve this misery
All my life and all my world has come falling down on me

[Verse 3]
I was a home watching my TV
When the noise of the phone rudely disturbed me
I wasn't too sure at first, just what the doctor meant
When he informed me that there had been an accident

"Why, oh why?" I heard her mother cry
As I rushed to the scene with the tears in my eyes
Somebody asked, somebody asked who was the next of kin
And oh Lord, it was the beginning of my end
