I'm doing my thing
With nobody but you, baby
I'm doing my real thing
With nobody but you, baby

I know a lot of people
Be telling you this and that
Oh, but don't you listen
Cause they don't know
Where it's at

Whenever you're near me
Just call out my name
I love you
When I'm away, girl
You don't have to worry

Cause I'm doing my thing
With nobody but you, baby
I'm doing my sweet thing
With nobody but you, baby

I know you get lonely
Baby, when I'm not around
And I know you're thinking
That I'm out on the town

Your friends are saying
That I've been untrue
Oh, but listen, baby
Don't you let that bother you

Cause I'm doing my thing
With nobody but you, baby
I'm doing my good thing
With nobody but you, baby

I'm doing my thing
With nobody but you, babe
I'm doing my good thing
With no one but you, baby

Cause I'm doing my thing
With nobody but you, babe
Nobody but you
Nobody but you...
