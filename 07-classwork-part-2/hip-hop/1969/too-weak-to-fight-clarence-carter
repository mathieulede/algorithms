There is something, baby, about you
That's really attracting me, yeah
And your sweet love, darling
Really got a hold on me

I've got a little taste of your love
And now I'm hooked on you, yeah
And I keep falling, falling
But what can I do

I'm too weak to fight
Listen to me, baby
Too weak to fight, yeah

You're breaking down my health, girl
Can't eat and I can't sleep, oh no
I've tried to turn you loose, now
But your hook is in too deep, oh yeah

My resistance is getting a little low
And I've got to find a cure, uh huh
'Cause I keep falling, falling
Falling for you, yeah

I'm too weak to fight
Listen to me, baby
Too weak to fight, yeah

I'm too weak to fight
You're messin' with my head
You got me too weak to fight, uh huh
Too weak to fight now, baby
I'm calling wrong numbers
Too weak to fight now, baby
You got my head going, going around and 'round, oh yeah
Too weak to fight now baby, baby, baby, baby, uh huh
Yes I am
