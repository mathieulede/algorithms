Ooh, hoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My, my, my, my
Black pearl
Precious little girl
Let me put you up
Where you belong
Black pearl
Pretty little girl
You been in the background
Much too long
You been working so hard
Your whole life through
Tending other people's houses
Raising up their children too
Hey, how about something
For me and you
Here in my arms
You're gonna reign supreme
No more serving, baby
They're gonna serve my queen
It's our turn for happiness
And our day has come
Living for each other
Answering to no one
Black pearl
Precious little girl
Let me put you up
Where you belong
Because I love you
Black pearl
Pretty little girl
You been in the background
Much too long
Together we'll stand
So straight and so tall
Created by love
To love one and all, hey
Heart to heart
Soul to soul
No other one
Could ever take your place
My world is built around
The very smile that's on your face
You'll never win a beauty show
No, they won't pick you
But you're my Miss America
I love you
Black pearl
Precious little girl
Let me put you up
Where you belong
Black pearl
Pretty little girl
You been in the background
Much too long
Ooh, hoo, yeah, yeah, yeah
My, my, my, my babe
You know I need you
Know I want to
Keep you for myself
I don't want nobody else
Now, baby, I love you
You know I need you
You know I got to, got to
Got to have you, baby
Come on, baby
Come on, come on
Come on and be my baby
You know I love you
I don't need nobody else
Let me put you up
Where you belong
