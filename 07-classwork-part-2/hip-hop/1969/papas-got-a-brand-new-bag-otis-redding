Come in sister
Papa's in the den
Ain't too hip
'Bout that new breed dance
It ain't no drag
He's doing the jerk
Don't play him cheap
Papa's got a brand new bag
You know he's not shy
He's doing the fly
The mash potatoes, the alligator
See you later alligator
Jump back Jack

Come in sister
Papa's in the den
'Bout that new breed dance
Ain't too hip
It ain't no drag
Papa's bought himself a brand new bag
Come on

Come on now, hey, hey
He's out of sight
He's uptight
Come on and groove me
Oh you're out of sight

He's doing the twist
You know he's not shy
He's doing the fly
Don't play him cheap
The mash potatoes, the alligator
See you later alligator
Jump back Jack
Papa's in the den
Come in sister
Ain't too hip
'Bout that new breed dance
It ain't no drag
My mammy's got a brand new bag
