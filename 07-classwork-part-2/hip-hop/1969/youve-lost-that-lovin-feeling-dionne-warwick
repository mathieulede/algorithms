You never close your eyes any more when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
Mmm, you're tryin' hard not to show it, baby
But baby, baby I know it

You've lost that lovin' feelin' me like you used to do
You know that
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find every day
No no, no no, no no no no no no no
So don't, don't, don't, don't, baby don't throw it away
Na na, don't throw it away, don't throw it away
Now baby, oh baby, I beg you baby, oh baby
I beg you please, I need your love
So bring it on back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it, bring it, bring it back

Bring back that lovin' feelin' o-o-oh that lovin' feelin'
