A-who, who, awho, who...

[Dennis:]
The childhood part of my life wasn't very pretty
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children beside me
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep
It was hard times
Needed something to ease my troubled mind

[Paul]
My father didn't know the meaning of the word
He disrespected Mama and treated us like dirt
I left home seeking a job that I never did find
Depressed and down-hearted, I took to Cloud 9

I'm doing (fine)
Up here (on cloud nine)
Listen, one more time
I'm doing (fine)
Up here (on cloud nine)

[Dennis]
Folks now they tell me
They say, "Give yourself a chance and don't let life pass you by"
But the world around you is a rat race where only the strong survive
It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie
Listen, it ain't even safe no more, to walk the streets at night

[Eddie]
I'm doing fine on Cloud 9

[Dennis]
Let me tell you about Cloud 9

(Cloud 9)
[Paul] You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud 9)
[Dennis] You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud 9)
[Eddie] Every man, every man is free
(Cloud 9)
[Dennis] You're a million miles from reality

(Reality) I'm gonna sail (up, up) higher (up, up... up, up and away) Cloud 9

[Eddie:]
I wanna say I love the life I live
And I'm gonna live the life I love
Up here on Cloud 9
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I'm riding high on Cloud 9

[Dennis] You're as free as a bird in flight
(Cloud 9) [Melvin:] There's no difference between day and night
(Cloud 9) [Eddie:] It's a world of love and harmony
(Cloud 9) [Dennis:] You're a million miles from reality

(Reality) I'm gonna sail (up, up) higher (up, up... up, up and away) Cloud 9

[Paul] You can be what you wanna be
(Cloud 9) [Dennis] You ain't got no responsibility
(Cloud 9) [Eddie] Every man in his mind is free
(Cloud 9) [Dennis] You're a million miles from reality
(Cloud 9) [Paul] You can be what you wanna be

Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom...

[Eddie]
I'm feeling fine on Cloud 9
