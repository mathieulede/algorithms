Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love

(Verse 1:)
Makes me shine just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
In my mind baby just a little bit, just a little bit
(you got to)
Keep me high baby just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
Can we spend some time
(can we spend some time)
Oooh baby baby

(1) - Just a touch of love a little bit
Just a touch of love
(repeat)

(2) - Just a touch of your love all the time to my mind
Just enough of your love to my mind keeps me high
Just a touch of your love all the time to my mind
Just enough of your love to my mind keeps me high

Need it now just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
Makes me frown baby just a little bit, just a little bit
(you got to)
Send fire through my spine just a little bit, just a little bit
(with just a touch of love)
Can we spend some time
(can we spend some time)

(Repeat 1)

(Repeat 2)

(Repeat Verse 1)
