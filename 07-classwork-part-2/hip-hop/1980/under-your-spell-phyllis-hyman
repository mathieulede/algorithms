It's after the rain
It's just like Sunday
Candy dreams inside my mind
I never knew
Loving could be this way

A trip on a star
Love keeps growing
Summer kiss
It's nicer knowing
You're here with me
So happy to be this way

I should have told you
Every word I say is true
I'm so in love
So in love with you

'Cause I'm falling under your spell tonight
I'm falling under your spell so right
Love's calling under your spell tonight
Yes, I'm falling under your spell so right

If this is a dream
Don't let me wake up
Don't disturb my fantasies
You are the best
You leave all the rest behind

Walks in the park
A Disney movie
Nursery rhymes and fairy tales
These are things
Loving you brings to me

I should have told you
Every word I say is true
I'm so in love
So in love with you

'Cause I'm falling under your spell tonight
Yes, I'm falling under your spell so right
Love's calling under your spell tonight
Yes, I'm falling under your spell so right

(I'm falling baby, falling under your spell)
(I'm falling baby, falling under your spell)
Walking in the park
Kissing in the dark
You got me under your spell

If this is a dream
Don't let me wake up
Don't disturb my fantasies
