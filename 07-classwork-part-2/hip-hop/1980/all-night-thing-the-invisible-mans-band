One, two, three...

Waiting on the dance to get started
Hollywood stands
It's jammed down

Hoo cha!
It's a party now

I wanna dance
I wanna dance
Everybody wanna dance
Move those bodies around

While the music spins
Get down
Get down
Get down
Get...

It's gonna be an all night thing
It's gonna be an all night thing
Baby, it's an all night thing
It's gonna be an all night thing

Break out!

Freaks on the floor
Freaks on the floor
All the freaks on the floor
On a Saturday night
Disco is explode
Strange freaky vibes

Flashing lights
Of red, blue, yellow and green
It's a funky scene
Ready for the hit
Get on your knees

It's gonna be an all night thing
It's gonna be an all night thing
Baby, it's an all night thing
It's gonna be an all night thing

Yeah, yes it is
Uh huh

Baby...
[skat]

Beat feet
Stamp
Mam
Move it on in
It's a sheet freak

Come on in
'Cause I can't go on such a hot date
Suga booga, would ya?
Could ya?
Move a little close for you to hear
Don't ya know?
You got me shifting in fifth gear

You look so fine
I want your number in my book
Gonna take you home with me
And get it on
All night long

It's gonna be an all night thing
It's gonna be an all night thing
Baby, it's an all night thing
It's gonna be an all night thing
