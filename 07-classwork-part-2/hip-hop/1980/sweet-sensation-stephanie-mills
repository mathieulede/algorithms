[Verse 1]
Something strange came over me 'cause I never felt this way
There's no place I'd rather be than here with you to stay
Can't explain what your love has done for me
(Love has done for me)
Keeps me warm and satisfied, ooh, you make me see

[Chorus]
Sweet sensation
(You're a sweet, you're a sweet)
A fantasy
(You're a sweet)
Sweet sensation
Sweet sensation
(You're a sweet, you're a sweet)
You're a fantasy
(You're a sweet)
Love vibration

[Verse 2]
Though my feet are on the ground, my mind is in the sky
Such a thrill, this ecstasy, and you're the reason why
I'm all aglow, love light shinin' through
(Love light shinin')
Ha, thank you, baby, I owe it all to you

[Bridge]
And I just wanna let you know
(Just wanna let, wanna let you know)
That I'll never let you go, yeah
(I'll never let, let you go)

[Verse 3]
Makes me feel so good inside to know that I've got you
It's like a dream, but when I wake I find out that it's true

[Chorus] + [Bridge] + [Chorus]

[Outro]
You're a sweet, you're a sweet
You're a sweet, sweet sensation
You're a sweet, you're a sweet
You're a sweet, love vibration
You're a sweet, you're a sweet
