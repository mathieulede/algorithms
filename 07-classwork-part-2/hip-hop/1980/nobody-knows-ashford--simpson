Like a mask you wanna take off
Cause you're tired of living with it
Wishing someone else knew
Sorry no one's never new

And nobody sees the midnight eyes
Nobody knows the sunny skies

Got a feeling only you know
What a shame they have to waste it
Once before life was bitter
Now you're so afraid to taste it

Well, nobody knows about the little things
Nobody knows what they really mean
Nobody ever wants to take the time
To examine what's on your mind

In the street, on a card you're a stand out
How you feel they know nothing about
But you want and you want to be wanted
You'd rather play hard to get instead

Nobody knows the inside
That's where all your little secrets hide
Nobody knows the inside
Maybe you, you got too much pride
And nobody knows the inside
I ain't got no magic mirror
Nobody knows the inside
That's why, that's why I can't get no nearer

You ought to tell somebody, tell somebody
Go on let it out
You try to, tell somebody, tell somebody
We want to hear what it's all about
Try to, tell somebody, tell somebody
Go on and get it off, get it off your chest
Tell somebody, tell somebody before the Son of all this

Nobody knows the inside
That's where all your little secrets hide
Nobody knows the inside
Maybe now, you got too much pride
Nobody knows the inside
I ain't got no magic mirror
Nobody knows the inside
That's why, that's why I can't get no nearer

Tell somebody, Tell somebody
Do it now, do it now, now right now
You ought to tell somebody, tell somebody
Scream and shout, your heart will feel good

Nobody knows the inside
That's where all your little secrets hide
Nobody knows the inside
Guess why, guess why? You got too much pride

Nobody knows the inside
I ain't got no magic mirror
Nobody knows the inside
That's why, we can't get no nearer
