I DON'T GO SHOPPING (PATTI LABELLE)

I don't go shopping for love
You're something money can't buy

I dream in colors, and my dreams are only shades of you
So I'm never blue

I don't go wishing on a star
Just want to be where you are
Too many times it felt so right
But it was just the nite
Now I see the light

I don't care nothing 'bout going out
Now that I found out what it's all about
Hear me shout
I've saved it all up for you
And if you feel like I do
Well we're long over due

I'm never out after dark
You'll always find me, here at home
And if you decide to stay up late

Hey baby don't you hesitate
Oh, I can't hardly wait

I don't care nothing 'bout going out
Now that I found what it's all about
Hear me shout
I've saved it all up for you
And if you feel like I do
Well we're long over due

I said we're
Long overdue
What about me, what about you
Long overdue......
What about me, what about you
Long overdue

I don't go shopping, anymore
What about me, what about you
Long overdue....

I don't go shopping, anymore.....
