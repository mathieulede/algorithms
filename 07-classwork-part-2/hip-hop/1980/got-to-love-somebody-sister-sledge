I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody
I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody

[Verse 1:]
Tired of movies all by myself
I’m sure you folks know what I mean
My time has come
And I need someone
To share my popcorn and jellybeans

Looked in the mirror
It all got clearer
I won’t let my life pass me by
Stop feeling sorry for myself
Fish are biting
I’ll throw out my line

I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody
(Hey)
I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody

I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody
(Hey)
I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody

[Verse 2:]
Must be careful
And watch my step
I hope the shock is very mild

I’ll change my hair
And change my style
Watch out
I might just go wild

I got to get out and live
And show the world
How much I can give
I’m gonna do it all by myself
I’ll make a love you can put on a shelf

[Chorus:]
I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody
(Hey)
I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody

I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody
I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody

I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody
(Hey)
I’ve got to love somebody today
I’ve got to love somebody
(Take me away, y’all)

I’ve got to love somebody today
(I’m gonna find him today now)
I’ve got to love somebody

I’ve got to love somebody today
(I’ve got to love, I’ve got to find somebody)
I’ve got to love somebody
(Oh, finally now)

I’ve got to love somebody today
(I’ve got to love, I’ve got to love you, baby)
I’ve got to love somebody
(Oh, there’s got to be a way)

I’ve got to love somebody today
(I’ve got to find it today now)
I’ve got to love somebody
(Hey, there’s got to be)
