[Verse 1:]
A faded photograph I mailed to you
With feelings I don't want to face
And a love song of surrender in blue
I remember when you took my breath away

[Chorus:]
Chanson papillon, we were very young
Like butterflies, like hot butterfly
Chanson papillon, we had just begun
We let it slide on by
We didn't realize

[Verse 2:]
All our memories are burning in time
Like a bittersweet perfume
Can you tell me how a love that's so fine
Could have climaxed in a single afternoon

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Gone are the days of instant romance
And the nights of slow goodbyes
That was a time of life when foxy was the dance
But then you got wise to all my lies

[Chorus]

[Vamp:]
Chanson papillon, chanson
Chanson papillon, chanson
Chanson papillon, chanson
Chanson papillon, chanson

[Ad-Libs:]
I just want to remind you
Oh, do you remember?
Do you remember?
