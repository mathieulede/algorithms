[Verse 1]
(Behind the groove)
There's another side inside of you
(Get behind the groove)
You can make your wildest dreams come true

[Hook]
So get on up (Behind the groove)
And shake your body (Get behind the groove)
Open up and take the music in (Get behind the groove)
You better get on up (Behind the groove)
Come to the party (Get behind the groove)
Life is waitin' for you to begin

[Verse 2]
(Behind the groove)
You can dance forever and a day
(Behind the groove)
There is romance just a glance away

Got to move, get behind the groove
Why don't you let your spirit play
Another me and another you
If we make it through to Xanadu, ooh

(Shake your body, shake your body)
(Shake your body, shake) Come on, I'll take you to Xanadu
(Shake your body, shake your body)
(Shake your body, shake)

(Behind the groove)
You can put away your masquerade
(Behind the groove)
You won't ever have to be afraid

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(Behind the groove)
Open your eyes and see what's in store
(Behind the groove)
I must be the one you're searchin' for

Got to move, get behind the groove
Why don't you let your spirit play
Another me and another you
If we make it through to Xanadu, ooh

You can put away your masquerade
You won't ever have to be afraid
Open your eyes and see what's in store
I must be the one you're searchin' for

There is romance just a glance away
You can dance forever and a day
A shake-shake, shake

Sing on, everybody sing on with me
