I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Ooh, when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

There you were, I was blinded
After love, swore I couldn't find it
A seduction grabbed my hand
Ooh, my body screamed but my heart just didn't understand

Life between the sheets is fine
If all you want to make this time
But if you want to make it last
Ooh, you'll lose control if you drive too fast

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Ooh, when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

Going down for the count
Now I'm in but you are out
My memories are my obsession
Beggin' for attention, ooh yeah

Apprehending all my criminal need
That stole your heart, then left you to bleed
Those days are over, baby, yes, I swear
Just say the word and I'll be there

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Ooh, when I touched ya
It made too much of you

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Ooh, when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Ooh, when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

I shoulda loved ya
I shoulda loved ya
Ooh, when I touched ya
I shoulda loved ya

I shoulda loved ya
(Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa)
I shoulda loved ya
(I, I shoulda loved ya)
Ooh, when I touched ya
It made too much of you
(Yeah, ooh ooh)

I shoulda loved ya
(Ooh, my baby, baby, baby, baby, babe)
I shoulda loved ya
(Said I, I shoulda loved ya)
Ooh, when I touched ya
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I shoulda loved ya
(I shoulda loved ya)
