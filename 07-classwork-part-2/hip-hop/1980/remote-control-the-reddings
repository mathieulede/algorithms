Tell me what's worse: The box or the bomb?
Tell me what keeps you up all night long?
Headlines hypnotize like deer caught in headlights
Pushing the issues way out of sight
Their hooks get caught deep in your eyes
It's thought control, erasing your mind
A televised culture united by greed
Satellites transmit the model family
Listen up, now it ain't what it seems
Pay no attention to the biased news team
You must understand it's part of the plan
Living in fear under their command
Failed actors reading the news with a smile
Turn it off, get up, go outside for awhile
