[Bridge]
I said upside down you're turning me
You're giving love instinctively
Around and round you're turning me

[Chorus]
Upside down
Boy, you turn me
Inside out, and
'Round and 'round

[Verse 1]
Instinctively you give to me the love that I need
I cherish the moments with you
Respectfully I say to thee I'm aware that you're cheating
When no one makes me feel like you do

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I know you got charm and appeal
You always play the field
I'm crazy to think you're all mine
As long as the sun continues to shine
There's a place in my heart for you
That's the bottom line

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
