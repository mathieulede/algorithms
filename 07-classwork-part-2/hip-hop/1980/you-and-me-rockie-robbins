How would you feel
If I asked you to spend your whole life with me
Baby believe in me
'Cause as strong as I'm for you from someone else would never be

Yeah, it's real, it's real, it's real
I've never felt this way before
So say you'll be mine
Together we will open every door

You and me
Together forever
You and me
Just us two

You and me
Belong together
Sharing everything that we do

Now you give me and I give you
I do what you want me to
Baby we can make it right
We'll be together forever

You and me
Just the two of u&115

When I was down
You came along and picked me up and made me strong
Yes it's true that my love for you makes the nights short
And my days too long

There you were from out of nowhere
Just like the sunshine on a rainy day
And I thank you for helping me
To take the lonliness away

Oh, you and me
Together forever
You and me
Just us two

You and me
Belong together
Sharing everything that we do

Now you give me and I give you
I do what you want me to
Baby we can make it right
We'll be together forever
You and me

Just the two of us

You and me
Girl, we'll be together eternally

You and me
I wanna thank you
For sharing you love
With only with me

You and me
I never felt this way before
Believe me
