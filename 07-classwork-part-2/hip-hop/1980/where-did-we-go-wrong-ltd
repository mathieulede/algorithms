(Where did we go wrong)
Now tell me what went wrong with love
And maybe we can fix it
(What's wrong between us)
(Where did we go wrong)
Now tell me what went wrong with love

It doesn't matter who is right or wrong
It doesn't matter whose to blame
We both have to swallow our pride
To make this love strong, ooh, baby

And we can conquer anything, hey, baby
Together, together, together, together
And if our love was meant to be, oh, girl
We'll find a way to save it
We'll build a road of love, oh, baby

(Where did we go wrong)
Now won't you tell me what went wrong with love
And maybe we can fix it
(What's wrong between us)
(Where did we go wrong)
Now won't you tell me what went wrong with love

I've had a lot of sleepless nights
With this crisis on my mind
Spinnin' 'round with my mind
Searchin' deep within to try to make it right, you and me

We can patch it up again, oh, baby
Together, together, together, together
If our love was meant to be, hey, girl
We'll find a way to save it, we'll build a road of love, oh, baby
Find a way to save it, we'll build a road of love, oh, baby
Find a way to save it, we'll build a road of love, oh, baby, oh...oh...oh...

(Where did we go wrong)
With love
And maybe we can fix it
(What's wrong between us)
(Where did we go wrong)
Yeah...hey...tell me what went wrong with love
And maybe we can fix it, baby, ooh...
(What's wrong between us)

(Where did we go wrong)
Ooh...ooh...ooh...
Tell your baby, tell your baby where did we go wrong
(What's wrong between us)
(Where did we go wrong)
Yeah...yeah...maybe we can work it out, work it out, maybe we can work it out
(What's wrong between us)

(Where did we go wrong)
Oh, tell your baby what went wrong
(Where did we go wrong)
(Where did we go wrong)
