When I wake up each morning
Trying to find myself
And if I'm ever the least unsure
I always remind myself

Though you're someone in this world
That I'll always choose to love
From now on you're only someone
That I used to love

As for me, it's getting down
To the last unspoken part
Where you must begin
To ease the pain of a broken heart

Tell me why should I even care
If I have to lose your love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

Wish it was enough for you
All the love I had to give
And I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know
How much I tried
I really tried

And if ever our paths should cross again
Well, you won't find me
Being the one to get lost again

Once, I had so much to give
That you just refused my love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

And I did my best to keep you satisfied
I guess you'll never know
How much I tried
I really tried

When I wake each morning
Trying to find myself
And if I'm ever the least unsure
I always remind myself

Though you're someone in this world
That I'll always choose to love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love

Though you're someone in this world
That I'll always choose to love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love
From now on
You're only someone that I used to love
