My love, when you talk to me
I can feel your every word
You sing the sweetest symphony
I've ever heard

It's the magic in your voice
And the beating of your heart
When you talk to me, talk to me

I can feel it in your kiss
There's no other love like this
How it's haunting me, haunting me
I know it's true, when you talk to me

My love, when you talk to me
Whispering the way you do
I see the dream that lives inside your eyes
Coming through

Wow, it's the magic in your voice
And the beating of your heart
When you talk to me, talk to me

I can feel it in your kiss
There's no other love like this
How it's haunting me, haunting me
I know it's true, when you talk to me

Time stands so still, my love
When ever I'm with you
You are the only one that I know
Who makes love in the way you do

It's the magic in your voice
And the beating of your heart
When you talk to me, talk to me

I can feel it in your kiss
There's no other love like this
How it's haunting me
Your love is haunting me

It's the magic in your voice
And the beating of your heart
When you talk to me, talk to me

I can feel it in your kiss
There's no other love like this
How it's haunting me, oh

It's the magic in your voice
And the beating of your heart
When you talk to me

I can feel it in your kiss
There's no other love like this
How it's haunting me, oh

It's the magic in your voice
And the beating of your heart
When you talk to me
