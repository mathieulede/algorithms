Is This The Best
(music intro - Big Band Sound)
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah

(1st verse)
Is this the best that you can honestly do?
To stay together I need a little more out of you (bop do wah, bop do wah)
Don't take for granted that I love like it sounds
Because you could be standing on a very shaky ground

(1st bridge)
Make sure you always know what's going on. (going on)
Don't let your homework be undone
You have to think of more than just yourself (just yourself)
And if that's too much to ask I'll find me somebody else (yeah!)
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah
(1st musical interlude)

(2nd verse)
Lord knows I try to do the best I can
And that seems to be something that you just don't understand (bop do wah, bop do wah)
I don't intend to have to beg you anymore... no no!
If you would give some thought to what I said before

(2nd bridge)
Make sure you always know what's going on (going on)
Don't let your homework be undone
You have to think of more than just yourself (just yourse-e-elf)
And if that's to much to ask I'll find me somebody else (find me somebody else)
(2nd musical interlude)
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah (Shab-shabba-shabba-de-da-duh-duh)
(End)
Make sure you always know what's going on (going on)
Don't let your homework be undone
You have to think of more than just yourself (just yourself)
And if that's to much to ask I'll find me somebody else (yeah!)
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah
Bop do wah, bop do wah, bop do wah
