I'm in love with a plain old-fashion girl
She's the most beautiful person in the world

Her smile is so warm and her eyes burn so deep, ah, yeah
Softly in rhymes of love she sings to me
{Love is for love} Oh {But only if it's meant to be}
Only if it's meant to be, baby

Yeah, hea, hea, I

I'm in love with a plain and simple girl
She takes my heart and sends me for a whirl
I'm on the wings of love and I don't take care where I go
Because when we reach that star we both will know
{Love is for love} Ooh {And our love was meant to be}
Our love was meant to be, baby, ooh

I want some lovin' tonight
Some old-fashion love, baby
I know that you do it right
Do it, do it, do it to it, baby

I want some lovin' tonight
Some old-fashion love, baby
I know that you do, do
Do it, do it, do it right, baby

I want (Ow), gimme, gimme, gimme (Whoa)
I want (Oh, girl) some old-fashion love, baby
(I want some lovin' tonight )
Do it, do it, do it (Some old-fashion love, baby)

I want (Ow), gimme, gimme, gimme (Whoa)
I want (Oh, girl) some old-fashion love, baby
I want (Oh, say it), gimme, gimme, gimme (Whoa)
I want (Oh, girl) some old-fashion love, baby

Oh, yeah
Ah., yeah
Oh, yeah
Ah, yeah

Do it, do it, do it

I want (Ow), gimme, gimme, gimme (Whoa)
I want (Oh, girl) some old-fashion love, baby
