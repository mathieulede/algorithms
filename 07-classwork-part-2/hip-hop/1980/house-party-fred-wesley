I can't go to the movies, I ain't got the fare
I like to make the disco but I haven't got a thing to wear
I'm gonna get my stereo and call up everyone
Come on over to my house and let's have some fun

We gonna have a house party...
We gonna have a house party-y-y
We gonna have a house party...
We gonna have a house party-y-y

Bring your own bottle or whatever turns you on
You can bring your lady or your other number one
I got all the ladies jammed and a great beat bass to dance
We might disturb the neighbors but I'll take that chance

We gonna have a house party...
We gonna have a house party-y-y
We gonna have a house party...
We gonna have a house party-y-y

Everybody say paaaaarty... (say what/come on) paaarty (x4)
... party... party (x4)
... party-party... party-party (x4)

It's not the weekend and I can't stay up too late
I hate to stop the party but I gotta be to work at 8
All of a sudden the house is full of all these pretty chicks
Maybe I'll get lucky, I'll just call in sick

We gonna have a house party...
We gonna have a house party-y-y
We gonna have a house party...
We gonna have a house party-y-y

Party, party it don't stop
Party till your body gets hot
