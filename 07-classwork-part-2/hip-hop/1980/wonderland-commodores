Hello, honey, this is your lucky day
I've come to take you far, far away
We'll use love as our guide to the stars
And if I'm lucky I'll put a thrill in your heart

Come into this wonderland of mine
And I'll take control of your beautiful mind
I can't tell you just what to expect
Whoa, the joy you give is the pleasure you get

Won't you come into this land of love?
Won't you come into this love with me?
Won't you come into this love of mine?
It's for you and for me

Mr.Taxi Driver, could you give us a ride
And take us down to, oh, Paradise Drive
Hurry, won't you hurry 'cause I just can't wait
Oh, one minute lost might be one minute too late
Sugar, don't you be afraid, no, no
Just take me by the hand and I'll show you the way

Ooh, hoo, yeah
It's for you, baby
All I need is you girl, all I ever needed is you

Whoa, girl, let me take you to a wonderland
It's for you, it's for me, that's how it's ought be in wonderland
It's for you, it's for me, that's how it's gonna be in wonderland
It's for you, it's for me, that's how it's gonna be in wonderland
