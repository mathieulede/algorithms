[Chorus]
I'm caught up in a one night love affair
Hoping true love will find me there
Caught up in a one night love affair
In need of love again, that's just the way I am

[Verse 1]
Before I let you in
There's just one thing I wanna say
There's no need to pretend
That this will end another way

Tomorrow you'll wake up and be on your way
Forget all the things you say tonight
That's why

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
So make yourself at home
I want you only for a while
I haven't got much time
To find the man behind the smile

I'm a fairy-tale princess in search of a knight
And I never believe dreams come true
I'm just like you
You see

[Chorus (4X)]

[Bridge]
Stay for a while, baby
Got to hold you for a while, lay with you in style
Close the door and I'm next to you
The music sweet, just watch what I'm gonna do

[Chorus (3X)]
