Girl of my dream, you are
Girl of my dream

Oh, the apple of my eye, you're my cherry pie
The sweet taste of wine at the right time
If someone would ask me why
I just can't deny you've had to leave

Girl of my dream, you are
Girl of my dream

Oh, you're my moment to remember
That day in September
Again and again, I feel it in my heart
If someone should ask me why
I just can't deny

The love we share, the ecstasy
As one we were completely
I need you, I need you

Girl of my dream, you are

The love we share, the ecstasy
As one we were completely
Oh, I need you, I need you

Girl of my dream, you are
Girl of my dream, you are
You are, you are my dream

Girl of my dream
Girl of my dream

Apple of my eye, you're my cherry pie
Girl of my dream, girl of my dream
Girl of my dream

The girl of my dream, yes you are
You are, you are, you are, you are
You are the girl of my dream

The girl of my dream
You are, you are, you are, you are
You are the girl of my dream
