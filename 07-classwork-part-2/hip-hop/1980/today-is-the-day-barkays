Today is the day
We'll both be walking away
'Cause love is gone
And we have no reason to stay

No, we won't look back
On the happy times
We'll just both look ahead
To peace of mind

So hold your head up high
And try not to feel bad
'Cause we gave it our all and all
We gave it all we had, oh baby

Goodbye, my love
You know that I wish you well
I couldn't give you Heaven
So I'm releasing you from Hell

You know that leaving you
Oh, is so very hard to do
And by the look in your eyes
You feel the same way too

So hold your head up high
And try not to feel bad
'Cause we gave it our all
And all and all and all
And all and all and all and

Do, do, do, do

Today is the day
We'll both be walking away
'Cause love is gone
And we have no reason to stay

We gave it our all and all
We gave it all we had
Ooh, but love is gone
Love is gone and we
Have no reason to stay

Today is the day
We'll both be walking away
'Cause love is gone
And we have no reason to stay

Oh, we gave it our all and all
We gave it all we had
