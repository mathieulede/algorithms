If life's got you under
The weather you
Pick it up and get higher
No one else can do it

If you didn't know it
It's up to you
Pick it up and get higher
Gotta get into it

Look up
And enjoy
Look up
And enjoy

Look up
And enjoy
Look up
And enjoy

If sometimes you're frownin'
Here's what you do
Pick it up and get higher
No one else can do it

If your life don't sing
You gotta move
Pick it up and get higher
And get right into it

Look up
And enjoy
Look up
And enjoy

Look up
And enjoy
Look up
And enjoy

Look up
And enjoy
Look up
And enjoy

Look up
And enjoy
Look up
And enjoy

If you want things smilin'
Then you ought to
Pick it up and get higher
No one else can do it

If you wanna make it
It's all on you
Pick it up and get higher
You can get into it (Ow)

'Round and 'round and 'round you go
Where you're headed I don't know
The way I hear the story's told
The choice is yours and yours to hold

Look up
And enjoy
Look up
And enjoy

Look up
And enjoy
Look up
And enjoy

'Round and 'round and 'round you go
Where you're headed I don't know
The way I hear the story's told
The choice is yours and yours to hold

Look up
And enjoy
Look up
And enjoy

Look up
And enjoy
Look up
And enjoy

Look up
And enjoy-joy
Look up
And enjoy

Look up
