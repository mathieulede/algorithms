[Minnie Riperton]
It's a lazy afternoon
Just a kind of a day made for lovin' you
Soon the evening breezes will start to blow
Baby, grab your hat now 'cause here we go

I love the things you do
And the way that I feel when I'm close to you
I have dreamed so long, is it really so?
Baby, grab your hat now 'cause here we go

Off to wonderland, floating hand in hand, like in the movies
Everyone can tell that I'm in love with you
I never knew what love could do
My heart begins to pound, whenever you're around
I'm never coming down

It's a quarter after two

[Peabo Bryson:] And there's no one around except me and you
[M:] Well it's times like this that I'm living for
[P:] Shall we turn the lights down and lock the door
[M:] Baby don't stop, don't you dare, no
[P:] Just a little bit more we're almost there
[M:] Any second now I'll explode
Baby, grab your hat now 'cause here we go

Off to wonderland, floating hand in hand, like in the movies
Everyone can tell that I'm in love with you
I never knew what love could do
My heart begins to pound, whenever you're around
I'm never coming down

I'm never coming down
I'm never coming down
