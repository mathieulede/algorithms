Steppin' out on the floor
Boogie woogie woogie some more
If you can boogie with your baby
Baby you can boogie with me
Steppin' out on the one
We're gonna have a whole lot of fun
If you can boogie with your baby
Baby you can boogie with me

High steppin', low steppin', rock steppin', roll steppin'
Rollin' on down the floor

Steppin' to the rumba boogie baby
