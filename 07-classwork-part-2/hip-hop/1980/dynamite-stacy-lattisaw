[Chorus #1:]
The way you feel funky music
It's dynamite
The way you use and you groove it
It's dynamite

Don't you know that
I love you madly
Like dynamite
Won't cha keep on dancin' beside me
It's dynamite

[Verse 1:]
I've got this feelin'
To ask you to dance
Not even thinking
To lead to romance

The lights are flashin'
We're out on the floor
My heart is thumpin'
Like crashin' thunder

[Chorus #2:]
'Cause when you move so sweet
When you're dancin'
Got the beat
Got the heat
Like dynamite
It's dynamite...

[Repeat Chorus #1:]

[Verse 2:]
Oh, baby, baby
You've got the rhythm
You drive me crazy
With what you're doing

[Repeat Chorus #2:]

Oh, dynamite!
Oh, dynamite!

[Repeat 4x:]
Can you dig it?
Checkin' it out, baby
Checkin' it out
Can you dig it, baby
(X4)

[Repeat Chorus #2:]
