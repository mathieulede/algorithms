Aw baby, I love your body when you dance this close to mine
And whatã€€I feel, I want to feel all the time
I want you for myself
I don't want no one else
I do love you

Oh baby, when you are dancin' and that glow is in your eyes
I get a thrill no one else can satisfy

I really love your smile
I want you by my side
I do love you

Oh baby, mm when you move, you know you move, the way you should
I want to love you, and you know that I'll be good

Oh baby, mm when you move, you know you move, the way you should
I want to love you, and you know that I'll be good
