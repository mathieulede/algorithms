A toast to the booty
Feel that, do that
For how else can you capture a boogie
If you don't attack from the back
To the rear, march!

My name is the one
Some people call me the funk
Here's a toast to the boogie!
Said my name is the one
Some people call me the funk, oh!
I'll toast to that!
And when I find a vacant booty
I move right in on the rump, ooh!
I'm like a camel
Humpin' to please
I'm up to my hump in funk, yeah
Here's a toast to the boogie!

I've got jam in my knee
And I'm ready to spread
All around the world for the funk
I'll toast to that!
We don't cut in
We just butt in
So baby, may I have this dance?

Here's a toast to the boogie!
We'll dance to that
Bottoms up!

I'll toast to that (x2)
Bottoms up!

Ahhhh
Here's a toast to the boogie
We'll funk to that, bottoms up
(x2)

Oww, my name is the one
Some people call me the funk
Here's a toast to the boogie
Said my name is the one
Some people call me the funk
I'll toast to that
And when I find a vacant booty
I move right in on the rump (move in on the rump)
I'm like a camel
Double-humpin' to please
I am up to my hump in my funk
Here's a toast to the boogie
I've got jam in my knees
And I'm ready to spread
All around the world for the funk (x2)

I am Sir Nose
D'Voidoffunk (double-humpin' to please)
And I will never dance (ahhhhhhhhh)
Prepare to meet your end, Starchild
For a tail is nothing but a long booty
And this is a tale that I win in the end
And I have pinned the tail on the funky
And you shall dwell in the maze of the mule forever, Starchild
Oh, mule-mo, oh duckypuss, Starchild!
Ahh, hahahaha
Humdrum, tweedle-dee-dee dum, Starchild!
And I have made a jackass out of the funk, hahahahaha
Oh, mule-mo, oh duckypuss
I, Sir Nose D'Voidoffunk
Shall never dance!
Ah hahahahaha
Yo ho, yourself, Starchild
Where's your Flash Light?
Where's your Bop Gun?
Where's the Doctor, Starchild?
Better tell him to come and make me a house call, Starchild!
Haa!
Oh, mule-mo, oh duckypuss
