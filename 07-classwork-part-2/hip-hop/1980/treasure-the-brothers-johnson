Moonlight won't ever be cold
As long as I have you to hold
And if I'm away from your side
You know that I'll miss you
From morning 'til night

Girl, I treasure each moment you're near
Treasure that good thing we share

Just one little smile is more than enough
To give me the pleasure
That comes with the treasure of love

I don't own a house on the hill
I ain't got a boat in the bay
But I know with you in my arms
I'm holding a diamond
That shines every day

Girl, I treasure each moment you're near
Treasure that good thing we share

And I'm not afraid to tell anyone
That I need your magic
To keep me love strong

Girl, I treasure each moment you're near
Treasure that good thing we share

And I'll never need dreams in my life
Cause you make them all come true
And now life's a pleasure
Cause I found a treasure in you
