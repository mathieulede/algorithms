I've been sittin' here too long talkin' to myself
Thinkin' of things I shoulda said
To let you know that I love you
Showin' you how I need you
Little things that mean so much
But we said goodbye instead

What I wouldn't do
For the love you
For the love you
What I wouldn't do

If we were together today
Oh, what a day
I'd faithful and true
There's nothing I would do

For the love of you
What I wouldn't do

I've been stayin' up at night callin' out your name
Dreamin' of how it might have been
Seein' you every mornin'
Holdin' you every night
The two of us becoming one
If only we could again

What I wouldn't do
For the love you
For the love you
What I wouldn't do

Whenever you need to me care
Well, I'll be there
If you only knew
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

For the love of you (For the love, for the love of you)
What I wouldn't do (There's nothin' I wouldn't do)
What I wouldn't do (For the love of you)
For the love of you (For the love of you)

For the love of you (For the love, for the love of you)
What I wouldn't do (There's nothin' I wouldn't do)
What I wouldn't do (For the love of you)
For the love of you (For the love of you)

For the love of you (For the love, for the love of you)
What I wouldn't do (There's nothin' I wouldn't do)
What I wouldn't do (For the love of you)
For the love of you (For the love of you)
