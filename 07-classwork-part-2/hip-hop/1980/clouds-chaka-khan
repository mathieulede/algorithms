[Verse 1]
(Clouds)
Different shapes and sizes
Hiding the horizon

(Clouds)
In the distance, coming to change my plans
All my dreams will melt like sand

(Clouds)
The moment that you say goodbye
They're gonna rush right to the sky

[Hook]
Baby, baby, please don't go

It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain down tears
Of heartaches and fears

It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain I know for sure
'Cause you don't reach for me no more

It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain down tears
Of heartaches and fears

It's gonna rain
It's gonna rain
There in the distance
Is that number one pain

[Verse 2]
(Clouds)
Thunder is the warning
So dark and so alarming

(Clouds)
Go away, go away
Go, don't take away my sunny days

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
(Clouds)
Leave me be
It's getting so dark out I just can't see

(Clouds)
Go away, go away
Go, don't take away my sunny days

[Hook]
