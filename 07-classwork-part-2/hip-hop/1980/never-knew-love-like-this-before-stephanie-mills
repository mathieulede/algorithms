I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

You are my lovelight
This I know
And I'll never let you go
You're my all
You're part of me

Once I was lost
And now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need
I call your name

Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
Cause I never knew love like this before

This feeling's so deep inside of me
Such a tender fantasy
You're the one I'm living for

You are my sunlight
And my rain
And time could never change
What we share forevermore

Ooh, hoo
I never knew love like this before
Now I'm lonely never more
Since you came into my life

Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
Cause I never knew love like this before

You are my lovelight
This I know
And I'll never let you go
You're my all
You're part of me

Once I was lost
And now I'm found
Then you turned my world around
When I need
I call your name

Cause I never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
Cause I never knew love like this before
What a surprise
Cause I never knew love like this before
Inside of me
(I never)
Never knew love like this before
Opened my eyes
