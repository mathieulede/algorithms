Have you ever looked in a face of age
Or lend your ears to what an old man had to say

Cause a every generation of us lie
Reflects a movie scene often more than twice

Child is born to live within the master plan
Boy grows up, leaves his home to be a man

Vintage years of wine for the wife
Every generation of life of our lives

Every generation of life
Reflects a movie scene often more than twice

Every generation of life
Reflects a movie scene often more than twice
Yeah

Rise and plant your seeds in the early spring
Summer's gone away, winter's back again

Cause a every generation of our lives
Reflects a movie scene often more than twice

Time will make us change, nothing stays the same
A fool gets stung, hides his heart and plays the game

Cause a every generation of our lives
Reflects a movie scene often more than twice
Yeah!
